00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.910
Match 9 ended in a draw. with Team Y's 
Niko scoring the equalizer against Team W.

2
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.410
As a result. Team Z is now in third place.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.380
Top 2 move on to the 2nd Selection

11
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.840
And the only match left in 
Building 5 is our final game.

12
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.360
If we draw. we won't advance. 
due to our worse goal difference.

13
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.060
So. in short. we need to win to 
survive. That's all there is to it.

14
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.670
Hey. Kuon's listening in on this.

15
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.670
Should I kill him?

16
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.440
I don't anyone would 
make deals with him now. anyway.

17
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.860
But man. it's a miracle 
Team Y came away with a draw.

18
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.900
Come to think of it. was Niko even 
the type to take on shots himself?

19
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.730
He got inspired by a certain someone.

20
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.970
So for some. losing makes them stronger.

21
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.120
Anyway. let's move on to the key players
 of our final opponent. Team V.

22
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.590
This trio has scored 
18 goals in three games.

23
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.340
thanks to their 
stupidly good attacking skills.

24
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.170
Tsurugi Zantetsu: five goals.

25
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.890
Mikage Reo: six goals.

26
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.180
And their team's top scorer. 
Nagi Seishiro: seven goals.

27
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.770
If we don't stop them scoring. we can't win.

28
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.900
So you can't win unless you try this hard?

29
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.940
Being weak sounds like a hassle.

30
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.430
Nagi Seishiro...

31
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.030
He gets on my nerves.

32
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.160
I will win!

33
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.960
Episode 8

34
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.960
The Formula for Goals

35
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.880
Hey. Nagi.

36
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.530
You left practice early today.

37
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.140
Yeah. I couldn't be bothered.

38
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.600
You know something?

39
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.250
If you skip practice too often.

40
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.630
the lactic acid in your knees will 
become a burst of bad glucosamine.

41
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.000
Did I get that right?

42
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.480
Sounded like it.

43
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.900
Silly Zantetsu. 
Nagi doesn't need to practice.

44
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.230
Reo. you're always spoiling Nagi.

45
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.410
Of course.

46
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.370
After all. he's...

47
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.850
my treasure. you know?

48
00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.060
My life was a total bore.

Reo.

54
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.960
You were born to surpass me.

55
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.030
Everything in this world
 exists solely for you.

56
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.930
Oh. honey. stop.

57
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.230
Reo. is there anything you want?

58
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:14.900
I'm bored.

59
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.040
This is no fun.

60
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.820
I could have anything I wanted.

Score

66
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.740
Top of the class again? 
Reo-chan. I'm so proud of you!

67
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.870
But there was nothing I wanted.

68
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.410
If I could get it easily. 
it wasn't worth having.

69
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.080
I wanted a treasure that 
would be mine and mine alone...

70
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.720
This is it.

71
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.000
I want this!

72
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.310
No way. Forget it.

73
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.990
But why?

74
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.700
You told me I could have whatever I wanted.

75
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.110
You are my successor.

76
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.760
And out of all the kids who play soccer. 
only a chosen few get to go pro.

77
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.340
There's no way you'll 
make it. starting so late.

78
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.620
He's right. Reo. Become
a top businessman instead.

79
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.380
I'm telling you this for your own sake.

80
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.350
Nothing these people have given me...

81
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.950
has been what I wanted.

82
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.630
I will make this school
 national champions.

83
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.020
That ought to shut them up.

84
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.210
Then. I'll aim for the World Cup.

85
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.690
But this is a prestigious prep school.
 so our soccer team is super weak.

86
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.570
What am I going to do? 
I don't want to give up.

87
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.070
Damn it all.

88
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.980
Oh. sorry...

89
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.040
Wow! Nice control!

90
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.620
Huh. Guess I didn't die.

91
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.770
Wait. wait! You're amazing! 
You on the soccer team?

92
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.130
Aw. I died.

93
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.510
But. like. who are you?
Wanna play soccer with me?

94
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.670
Oh. you're that rich guy's son.

95
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.930
Can I have some money?

96
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:09.470
Huh?

97
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.610
I don't wanna play soccer. 
and I've never played sports before.

98
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.500
I just want to chill and do nothing
 for the rest of my life.

99
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.020
Can I have some money?

100
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.330
But I mean. look at that control just now. 
and your physique! You've got serious talent!

101
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.530
Play soccer with me!
 If you work hard. you can go pro!

102
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.320
I'd have to work hard at it?

103
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.240
Soccer sounds like a hassle.

104
00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.210
I hate things I have to work hard at.
 I don't wanna work.

105
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.710
Only a chosen few get to go pro.

106
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.310
There's a chosen one right here.

107
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.990
I want him for my own!

108
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:52.970
I like you!

109
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.690
You don't need to change.

110
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.290
My life was a total bore.

111
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.060
Let's play soccer!

112
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.990
That is. until I found 
soccer and Nagi Seishiro.

113
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.280
That's a "Can we win the next match?" face.

114
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.030
It's a "My tummy hurts!" face.

115
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.790
It's an "I wonder how granny's doing" face.

116
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:18.810
Wrong!

117
00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.300
The answer is: It's a 
"What does rain taste like?" face.

118
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.540
How are we meant to get that?!

119
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.820
The Wanima brothers' "What is 
this face?" game is really tough!

120
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.350
What the heck are you doing?!

121
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.270
You guys have to focus! Focus!

122
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.920
Hmm... An "I'm seriously pissed off" face?

123
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.930
This face is not a quiz question!

124
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.810
Then. let's have a strategy meeting.

125
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.520
Hold on.

126
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.520
I haven't forgiven this guy yet.

127
00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.440
You're gonna spill the beans to
 someone again. ain't ya? Huh?!

128
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.410
Let's start by taking turns punching him!

129
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:54.720
Great idea. Raichi!

130
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.120
He needs to be punished!

131
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.650
Hey! Quit it!

132
00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.340
You're gonna injure him!

133
00:07:59.340 --> 00:07:59.910
What?!

134
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.920
I'm saying we need him so we can 
play as an eleven and beat Team V!

135
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:05.930
Are you stupid?

136
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.500
No way I'm playing!

137
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.520
Huh?

138
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:15.310
Even if Team Z loses. with three goals. 
I get to advance as our top scorer.

139
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.220
So the best course of action 
for me is to just do nothing.

140
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.390
Yup. I'm gonna kill him!

141
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.770
I said quit it!

142
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:25.270
But if I score three goals
 in the next match.

143
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.100
I'll be the top scorer 
with four goals in total.

144
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.140
Do you still say you won't play?

145
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.000
Huh?

146
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.400
You think you can score a hat-trick 
playing with 10 men against Team V—

147
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.460
I'll do it.

148
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:39.620
I'll crush you. fair and square.

149
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:43.120
If you want to try. knock yourself out.

150
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.880
You can't play soccer alone. 
I know that better than anyone.

151
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:52.340
What do you mean?

152
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.700
Shut up.

153
00:08:54.410 --> 00:09:01.810
I've been working really hard to make my
dream of winning the World Cup a reality.

154
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.930
I can't keep up. Kuon.

155
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:05.810
You're really overbearing.

156
00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.870
Becoming national champs. 
being selected to represent Japan...

157
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.950
You're the only one 
who's serious about all that.

158
00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.700
I can't let it end here.

159
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.330
I don't want to lose because 
of my teammates anymore.

160
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.790
Can it. scumbag!

161
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.150
No traitor will ever be a World Cup winner!

162
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.820
You can say what you like.

163
00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.250
Soon. I won't have to look at you anymore.

164
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.300
You bastard!

165
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.950
Hey. hold on.

166
00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:37.970
If the top scorers are tied on goals.
 which one advances?

167
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.070
If I remember correctly. 
the one with fewer yellow cards.

168
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.050
And if they're tied on that. too?

169
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.760
The one who has the higher 
Blue Lock ranking will advance.

170
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.980
Hi. It's been a while. Ego Jinpachi here.

171
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.580
If the team loses and your goals 
and fair play tally are the same...

172
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:58.490
265\h\h\hKuon Wataru
266\h\h\hChigiri Hyoma
267\h\h\hIsagi Yoichi
268\h\h\hKunigami Rensuke
269\h\h\hGagamaru Gin
270\h\h\hBachira Meguru
271\h\h\hIemon Okuhito
272\h\h\hRaichi Jingo
273\h\h\hImamura Yudai
274\h\h\hNaruhaya Asahi
275\h\h\hIgarashi Gurimu

173
00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.490
then the top-ranked player will survive.

174
00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:59.530
Huh?

175
00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.240
See? I'm at the top.

176
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.460
Why?! Why's that traitor at the top?!

177
00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:15.840
265\h\h\hKuon Wataru
266\h\h\hChigiri Hyoma
267\h\h\hIsagi Yoichi
268\h\h\hKunigami Rensuke
269\h\h\hGagamaru Gin
270\h\h\hBachira Meguru
271\h\h\hIemon Okuhito
272\h\h\hRaichi Jingo
273\h\h\hImamura Yudai
274\h\h\hNaruhaya Asahi
275\h\h\hIgarashi Gurimu

178
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:11.150
In this first selection. 
scoring is the only thing assessed.

179
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.380
And what he did isn't against the rules.

180
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.840
But let me say this. Kuon Wataru...

181
00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.510
As a striker. you are the lowest
 of the lowest of the low.

182
00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.800
Basically. you're all crap.

183
00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:27.390
You might feel you've survived
 a life-and-death situation.

184
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.900
but it was by pure luck.

185
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.770
Your play had no value whatsoever.

186
00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:38.900
The world's best striker must be
 able to reproduce their goals.

187
00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.620
The more dramatic a goal is. 
the more impressive it is.

188
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.620
But tons of players can 
score those one-off goals.

189
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.420
Why can't they reproduce those goals?

190
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.960
It's because those goals were 
nothing but the products of luck.

191
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.540
Besides. a rigged goal brought about by 
betrayal is trash with zero reproducibility.

192
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:05.990
What you need right now is the 
formula to create scoring opportunities.

193
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:11.830
Analyze how. when. and under what circumstances
 your weapon helped you to score a goal.

194
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.770
How far away was the goal?

195
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.910
How many defenders were there?

196
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.350
Where did you receive the pass?

197
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.360
What did you feel in that moment?

198
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.550
Internalize every detail. 
then reproduce it.

199
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:29.120
Your positioning. your touch.
 your dribbling. your shooting...

200
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:32.530
Devise a formula that will 
make you shine the most.

201
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:36.960
World-famous strikers have 
their own formulas for scoring.

202
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:43.540
You still live in the sea of
 coincidences. That won't do.

203
00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:49.020
Understand that you can only evolve
once you've nailed reproducibility!

204
00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:53.400
In a match. you can expect 
only irregularities to happen.

205
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:58.030
Someone who can prove their 
own formula on such a battlefield

206
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:04.550
can become the world's best striker.
who will crank out goals. one after another.

207
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.170
Don't rely on chance to win.

208
00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:09.490
Win the game because you're meant to!

209
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:10.830
Until the

210
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.330
Until the

211
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.840
Anyhow. Kuon. don't do 
anything in the next match.

212
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.840
Until the

213
00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.580
Do something stupid again.
 and I'll kill you for real.

214
00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.790
The "reproducibility" of goals...

215
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:31.600
So we have to be able to use our weapons
 at any given time and with certainty.

216
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.020
It can't be left to chance.

217
00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:39.860
My weapon is spatial awareness. 
but I couldn't do anything alone.

218
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.490
It doesn't feel like 
we can win at this rate.

219
00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.640
If we don't evolve. we can't win.

220
00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:02.090
1st Selection

221
00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:02.090
Building 5

222
00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:02.090
Top Scorer

223
00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:02.090
10 Goals

224
00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:01.510
What's up. brainless?

225
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.050
What are you doing here?

226
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.970
Team X

227
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.640
Tell me something. Barou.

228
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.970
How can I be more like you?

229
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:23.980
Hey. c'mon...

230
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.780
Use your brain. you donkey.

231
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:28.290
Hold on!

232
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:30.660
You can score goals all by yourself.

233
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.370
You're the strongest player I've ever met.

234
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.770
I don't want it to end here. I want to win.

235
00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:39.460
I want to be someone who can do it alone!

236
00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.580
Hey. brainless.

237
00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.720
That dream-filled. garbage ego of yours...

238
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.430
I'll crush it. right here. right now.

239
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.060
A one-on-one?!

240
00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.720
I'm no match for him physically.

241
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.810
I'll watch his feet and the ball. 
and steal it when I can.

242
00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.940
I'll move when he tries to set it up.

243
00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:58.770
There!

244
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.150
But he hasn't gone past me yet.

245
00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:05.860
Huh?

246
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.580
More than 20 meters from the goal. 
and he aimed for the top-right corner?

247
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.270
His precision is insane.

248
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.760
See you never. donkey.

249
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.040
Hey. hold on!

250
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.750
One more time! Please!

251
00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.000
Come on! Don't tell me you're done!

252
00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.710
Who do you think you're talking to?

253
00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.170
I am the king!

254
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:31.300
I won't lose him this time. I'll stay on him 
so he doesn't get a chance to shoot.

255
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.340
Shit. he's gonna shoot.

256
00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.060
But I can almost reach it—

257
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.020
A feint?

258
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.650
Holy crap. Was he aiming 
at exactly the same spot?

259
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.370
You're finished. donkey.

260
00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:56.750
A momentary gap is all he needs to 
score a goal from wherever he is.

261
00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.210
So this is Barou Shouei...

262
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.500
The formula for scoring.

263
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:02.770
But wait.

264
00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.550
If Barou has a formula for scoring. then...

265
00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.090
I'll stop you this time.

266
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:12.850
Come at me. "King."

267
00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.470
I know what you're capable of.

268
00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:17.420
Stop your barking. lowly commoner.

269
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.850
Know your place.

270
00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:25.230
If my hypothesis is correct. 
he won't shoot from this position.

271
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:29.650
Slightly left-of-center.
 About 40 to 45 degrees.

272
00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:32.610
At 23 meters out.

273
00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:36.830
From there. an ultra-fast 
bending shot to the top-right corner...

274
00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.080
That's Barou's guaranteed scoring range!

275
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.290
He won't shoot yet.

276
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:44.120
So it's not like he can score
 from just anywhere.

277
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.460
Barou gets a ton of goals
because there's an area

278
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:50.210
where the chances of him
scoring goes up exponentially.

279
00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:54.680
But during a game against opponents. he can't easily enter that area.

280
00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.760
So he makes it possible 
with his burst of speed.

281
00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.520
That's why he needs 
that incredible physique!

282
00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:08.820
By doing everything to get to this area.
 Barou reproduces his goals.

283
00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.780
That's the trick behind his formula.

284
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.630
Only my eyes can see that!

285
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:17.130
If I can keep him out of 
that area. I can stop him!

286
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.830
Don't get the wrong idea. donkey.

287
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.330
My range is actually...

288
00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.250
27 meters!

289
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:30.460
He's a monster.

290
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:32.300
As I thought...

291
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.040
He's amazing!

292
00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.790
Th-Thanks. Barou. For teaching me.

293
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:39.470
I didn't teach you anything.

294
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:43.670
I just made you realize that I'm on the field.

295
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:47.980
That's more than enough to make a brain-dead
 donkey like you quit out of despair. isn't it?

296
00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.290
So cool.

297
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.630
Even so. thanks!

298
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:10.170
Until the

299
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:10.170
Until the

300
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.580
Only 20 hours to go until the final match.

301
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:10.880
Absolute Weapon

302
00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.930
I get how Barou's formula
 for goals works now.

303
00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:11.880
A Situation "A" Can Be Used

304
00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:12.960
Mass Production of Goals

305
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:14.550

Mass Production of Goals

308
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.880
but his weapon isn't the kind I can copy.

309
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.600
+ Burst Power

310

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.200
My weapon is spatial awareness.

Spatial

319
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:25.180
But by itself. it's not something
 that can help me score.

320
00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.230
I'll have to find my answer in the game.

321
00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.470
Am I scared?

322
00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.050
Everything gets determined tomorrow.

323
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.840
My soccer career might end.

324
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.660
If we lose. I'll...

325
00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.410
Hey. Isagi.

326
00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.340
Tomorrow... we'll have our answer.

327
00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.790
Igaguri...

328
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.300
I can't sleep because I'm too scared.

329
00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.950
If I don't become a soccer player. 
I have to take over the temple.

330
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.270
Blue Lock is my last chance.

331
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:08.590
I never knew the prospect of your 
dream ending could be so scary.

332
00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:12.260
I see.

333
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:14.410
I'm shaking because I'm scared.

334
00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.260
No. you're right.

335
00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.200
Huh?

336
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.110
We fight because we're scared.

337
00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.770
Fear makes us grow strong.

338
00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:26.580
Isagi...

339
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:28.610
We're gonna win.

340
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.630
We're not done yet.

341
00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:36.050
Until the

342
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.260
Until the

343
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.720
Isagi

344
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.720
Bachira

345
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.720
Imamura

346
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.720
Chigiri

347
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.720
Kunigami

348
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.720
Igaguri

349
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.720
Raichi

350
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.720
Naruhaya

351
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.720
Gagamaru

352
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.720
Kuon

353
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.720
Iemon

354
00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:46.660
Due to their shooting skills. our front three
 will be Kunigami. Gagamaru. and Chigiri.

355
00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.130
The other team's offensive 
skills are off the chart.

356
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:53.390
so we'll drop back all the way 
and defend against their attacks.

357
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:54.190
And...

358
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.470
We'll aim to score with
a quick counterattack.

359
00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:01.030
With only ten of us. this is 
the only practical strategy.

360
00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:04.870
Hey. Kuon. stand in your corner 
and be anonymous for 90 minutes.

361
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.510
Don't interfere or try to help us.
 you piece of trash.

362
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.580
Touch the ball in any way. and I'll kill you.

363
00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.290
No need to tell me twice.

364
00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:14.420
I don't want to pick up an injury that 
might hamper me in the second selection.

365
00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:18.370
The other team already know they're 
through. so their guard should be down.

366
00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.680
If we take advantage of that. 
we can win! We have a chance!

367
00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.800
Let's do it!

368
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.010
It's now or never.

369
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:24.010
Let's go.

370
00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:25.170
Yeah.

371
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.460
Let's win. Team Z!

372
00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:34.550
Yeah!

373
00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:38.150
If we don't win. it's all over.

374
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.490
My whole soccer career 
depends on this final match!

375
00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.030
Hey. Isagi.

376
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:48.830
If we lose. does that mean we can't see 
each other or play soccer together anymore?

377
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.370
Bachira...

378
00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:54.010
That's way too sad. so I'll give it my all.

379
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.270
Yeah. Let's go win this.

380
00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.260
Until the

381
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.020
Until the

382
00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.020
Bring it on.

383
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:21.530
We're the ones who are gonna win!

384
00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.030
Until the

385
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.990
We've studied Team V's offensive patterns.

386
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:32.500
The initiator of all their attacks is...

387
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:33.600
this guy.

388
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.710
Team V
BL Ranking

389
00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.710
nd

390
00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.390
But I can't stop him one-on-one.

391
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:41.010
Still. his passing will 
lead to goals for Team V.

392
00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.240
so I won't let him run free in midfield.

393
00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.220
Bachira and I will mark him tightly.

394
00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.830
Good!

395
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:50.810
If he can't pass it forward. 
then this guy shows up to take it...

396
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.460
This left-footed speedster.

397
00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:54.020
Team V
BL Ranking

398
00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.020
rd

399
00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:58.700
He tends to score mid-range shots from a 
tighter angle on the right side of the goal.

400
00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.530
But that path is completely 
blocked by two defenders.

401
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:03.740
And then...

402
00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.630
It's just as we predicted!

403
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.320
Team V
BL Ranking

404
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:08.320
st

405
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.200
Igaguri!

406
00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.700
Right!

407
00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.410
We can cut it out there!

408
00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:13.380
Yeah!

409
00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.970
Pick up the ball. Isagi!

410
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:15.650
All right!

411
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.080
Now. we counter.

412
00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:18.580
Let's go. Bachira!

413
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.300
Sure! Let's go.

414
00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:26.130
Without disturbing our defensive setup. 
we commit only a few to the attack.

415
00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:30.930
A strong defense and a quick attack... 
It's a super-long pass. instant-kill counter!

416
00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:32.790
Go for it. Gagamaru.

417
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:34.500
Can I reach that?

418
00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:36.440
I'm sure I can.

419
00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.600
With my foot...

420
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.860
No. a diving header!

421
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:46.320
So close!

422
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.110
But this strategy works.

423
00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:47.820
Nice shot.

424
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:48.950
Let's try again.

425
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:49.820
Oh. yeah!

426
00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.320
One more time!

427
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:59.170
Oh. man! Now this is interesting!

428
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.000
Hey. Nagi! Let's give that move a try!

429
00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.720
Huh? Sounds like a hassle.

430
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.170
Huh?

431
00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:08.360
What?

432
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.680
What's he talking about?

433
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:15.530
Are they going to copy 
our instant kill counter?

434
00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:17.520
That's overhit! He misplaced the pass!

435
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:30.780
He controlled it?

436
00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.100
What exactly is this creature?

437
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:48.050
That was easy.

438
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.630
I don't know why you couldn't do that.

439
00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:58.300
He's a monster...

440
00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:02.160
A

441
00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.320
Blue Lock. Additional Time.

442
00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:02.320
Additional Time!

443
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:02.530
Additional Time!

444
00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:02.740
Additional Time!

Additional Time!

Additional Time!

Additional Time!

Blue Lock

453
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.200
Additional Time!

454
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:04.950
Blue Lock

455
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:04.950
Additional Time!

456
00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:08.530
Hey. Reo. What are the 
rules of soccer again?

457
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.930
Wife Material Reo

458
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.930
Wife Material Reo

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:12.940
Nagi Seishiro

Nagi Seishiro

Mikage Reo

Mikage Reo

463
00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:12.510
All you need to do is receive the
 pass I hit to you and score a goal.

464
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.850
Hey. Nagi. Which cleats do you wanna use?

465
00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.620
Can't be bothered to think
 about it. so whichever.

466
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.440
This training session's so tiring.

467
00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:27.170
Let's take a break. I'll give you 
a piggyback ride. so come here.

468
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:25.340
Pop

469
00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:25.380

Pop

472
00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.630
My muscles are sore...

473
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:30.710
Around here?

474
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:32.760
A little lower.

475
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.270
Must be growing pains.

476
00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.750
Coming to practice tomorrow?

477
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.570
Soccer's so troublesome.

478
00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:44.200
I'll come pick you up after class. okay?

479
00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.330
What a pain...
