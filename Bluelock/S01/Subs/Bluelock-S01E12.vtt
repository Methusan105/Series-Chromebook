1
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.700
What is this place?

2
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.430
Huh? What the heck?

3
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.110
What's about to happen?

4
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.020
Episode 12

5
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.020
The Second Selection

6
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.490
2nd Selection

7
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.490
1st Stage

8
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.950
"Blue Lock Man"?

9
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.360
A hologram?

10
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.490
They want me to score a goal?

11
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.160
It's getting smaller...

12
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.810
I see.

13
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.710
This is penalty area
 situational training.

14
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.630
You must assess the situation fast.

15
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.380
run into the space that's 
getting smaller by the second.

16
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.030
outwit the goalkeeper.

17
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.180
and grab a goal!

18
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.930
Sweet. Right on the money.

19
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.640
It's on the perfect line.

20
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.920
Seriously? He stopped that?!

21
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.310
That wasn't a high school-level save.

22
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.810
Wait. did a hologram just touch the ball?!

23
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.860
To clear the stage: 100 goals

24
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:54.160
To clear the stage: 100 goals

25
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.660
To clear the stage: 100 goals

26
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.770
Oh. I get it.

27
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.780
To clear the stage: 100 goals

28
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.490
I have to score 100 goals past this Blue 
Lock Man in 90 minutes to clear the stage.

29
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.580
To clear the stage: 100 goals

30
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.250
A lone battle that tests my ego
 in the penalty area.

31
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.860
I can't score a goal by just taking potshots.

32
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.790
You can't clear this room unless 
you have an exceptional weapon.

33
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.040
Interesting.

34
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.310
Bring it on.

35
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.130
There! From the left.

36
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.720
The goal's on the right this time.

37
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.050
I have to assess the space in a flash!

38
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.390
The ball's trajectory...

39
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.450
Feel the speed of it...

40
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.600
Efficiently glide toward where it'll fall...

41
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.190
Then gauge the distance to the goalie.

42
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.280
and hit it first-time!

43
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.870
All right. that works.

44
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.290
But this training is seriously amazing!

45
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.590
It recreates the final
 moments in front of goal.

46
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.800
which means I won't clear the stage if 
I don't hone my weapon and improve my shots.

47
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.450
This is good. I can do this.

48
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.400
My weapon works!

49
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.060
There are more holograms now?

50
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.730
Makes sense. It's a penalty area simulation. 
so there'd obviously be defenders.

51
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.570
There!

52
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.990
Ack! This is hard!

53
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.890
The difficulty level just shot up.

54
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.450
That won't work. I need to be more accurate.

55
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.960
I need to evolve or I won't clear this stage!

56
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.280
This training room lined with high-res panels 
that can fire balls from its walls at random

57
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.260
improves upon similar facilities used by 
Germany's top clubs to hone explosive power.

58
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.050
It can create situations based on
 each player's individual qualities.

59
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.160
Crucially. it has 
the Blue Lock Man system.

60
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.260
an AI hologram goalie programmed
using data from world-class goalies.

61
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.900
A microchip sensor in the ball makes physical 
interactions with a hologram possible.

62
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.740
This is holographic sports technology.

63
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.240
I'll cut to the chase. Ego-san.

64
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.200
We're out of funds.

65
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.150
Shut up. Anri-chan.

66
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.570
This is exactly what I envisioned.

67
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.490
The way to clear this stage will change 
depending on how a player uses their skills.

68
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.290
For those who survived because 
others did the scoring for them.

69
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.060
this 90-minute stage will be a challenge.

70
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.140
But for a striker who can turn zero 
into one with their own weapon.

71
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.940
this is a place to hone and polish
 their skills so they evolve.

72
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.650
Test out how you use your weapon 
and feel your progress.

73
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.280
When you leave this room. you will all 
be on a whole new level as strikers.

74
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.470
Yeah!

75
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.790
To clear the stage: 100 goals

76
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.790
The three dummies appear at random.

77
00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.660
Where the ball comes from. its trajectory.
 plus where the goalie is...

78
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.170
If I can get all that down...

79
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.000
I can grab a goal!

80
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.100
To clear the stage: 100 goals

81
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.590
It looks like those who are improving 
are making visible strides forward.

82
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.390
This training is incredible.

83
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.020
You haven't seen anything yet. Anri-chan.

84
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.520
This is just the beginning.

85
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.240
"Level: max"?!

86
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.190
L-Let's take a breath.

87
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.430
I just need to do the same as before.

88
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.210
That's crazy fast! And it's got spin. too!

89
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.170
It's tough to get good contact on it!

90
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.030
So this is what "Level: max" means?

91
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.480
Just like in a real game. high-level balls 
come at you. and the dummies move randomly.

92
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.310
This is an artificial recreation of what 
happens in the box in top-level matches.

93
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:59.380
Assessing the situation and responding.
Quality shooting with accuracy.

94
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.650
And the stamina to sustain 
all that for 90 minutes.

95
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.110
Mind. technique. physical strength. 
You need all of them to pass this stage.

96
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.780
A pretender will find out 
just how powerless he is.

97
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.360
Damn it. I can't score at all.

98
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:21.290
But I can still keep running around. 
thanks to the physical conditioning we did.

99
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.500
Now that I'm here. 
I think I finally understand.

100
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.410
My goals were made possible 
because of Bachira's passes.

101
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:39.180
Unlike these erratic balls. he fed me with
passes where and how I wanted them.

102
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.650
Kunigami drew the defenders 
toward him to become a wall for me.

103
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.610
Chigiri was always waiting for 
a pass from me in my field of vision.

104
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.070
Because of those guys. 
I was able to score goals.

105
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.260
I wasn't fighting alone.

106
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.590
But that's not good enough.

107
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.190
I want the kind of strength 
that allows me to fight alone!

108
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.500
I need to pull together all my skills.
 Prioritize what must be done.

109
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.460
Hone everything and focus. Let's do this!

110
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.800
Assess the situation in a flash!

111
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.470
Note where the defenders and goalie are.

112
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.930
then run directly to where I'll shoot from.

113
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.600
Gauge the trajectory and spin of the ball. 
then blast it into the top left corner!

114
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:26.730
No good.

115
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:32.450
Where it actually went

116
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:32.450
Where it actually went

117
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.260
My spatial awareness
and positioning are perfect.

118
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.450
Where Isagi was aiming

119
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.450
Where Isagi was aiming

120
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.440
but my direct shot isn't 
going where I envision.

121
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.960
Damn it.

122
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.540
Trying again with the 
same mindset is pointless.

123
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:39.820
What I'm lacking right now is 
the technique to make good contact.

124
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:43.790
Bachira's passes were 
very easy to take first-time.

125
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.670
But the balls in this room are erratic
and tough to connect with.

126
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.130
I see. Just blindly blasting it won't help.

127
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:57.640
I only need to use 80%... No. 70% of the 
power I've been using to shoot up to now.

128
00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:02.770
In that final moment. I need to direct 
all of my attention to the point of impact!

129
00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:10.610
This is it. This is the essence of my goal.

130
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:15.240
Tricks and formulas exist
to score a simple direct shot!

131
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:15.240
Spatial awareness

132
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:15.240
Spatial awareness

133
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:15.240
Direct shot

134
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:15.240
Positioning
Skill to make contact

135
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.990
Oh man. This is so much fun!

136
00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:22.460
I keep discovering sides of me 
I didn't know about before!

137
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.160
That boy's improving rapidly.

138
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.850
We humans are creatures that 
only see what we want to see.

139
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:36.050
Becoming aware of your limitations changes
 how you see and think about everything.

140
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.470
Right now. he must be...

141
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.130
Yeah!

142
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.870
trembling at his own evolution.

143
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.730
2nd Selection\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h1st Stage

144
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:52.850
I've never thought so deeply 
about the shots I take before.

145
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.830
I know I can get even stronger!

146
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.080
Form a team of 3 and proceed

147
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.620
Is this the second stage?

148
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:11.050
Form a team of 3 and proceed

149
00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.010
A team of three?

150
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.970
Form a team of 3 and proceed

151
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.100
Nagi and Reo are here. too.

152
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:29.200
Oh. right. A team of three means 
they must be waiting for Zantetsu.

153
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.020
Oh. hey. Isagi's here.

154
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.960
Bachira!

155
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:35.940
Yay!

156
00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.630
Reunited again!

157
00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.820
Good job. Congrats on clearing the stage.

158
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.530
Oh. I see.

159
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.250
So all we have to do for the 
second stage is form a team?

160
00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:48.220
Who do you want to fill the last spot?

161
00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:48.750
Huh?

162
00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.330
Me plus you leaves one spot free.

163
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.570
So he just went ahead and decided 
we were on the same team. huh?

164
00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.110
Not that I mind.

165
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:58.770
Who should we pick?

166
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.480
Let's see...

167
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.470
The players that come to 
mind who I'd want are...

168
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.200
Kunigami or Chigiri. I guess.

169
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.940
Nice.

170
00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:13.060
But since it's a team of three. we can only 
pick one. So which would you prefer?

171
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.820
How about teaming up with 
the one who gets here first?

172
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:22.420
Sounds good.

173
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.660
And that will be our new team.

174
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:25.710
Great.

175
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.850
Hey. Isagi Yoichi.

176
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.660
Want to join our team?

177
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.450
Huh?

178
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.630
Come join our team.

179
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:38.340
Hey now. Nagi. This is the guy
 you wanted to team up with?

180
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:39.580
Yeah.

181
00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.790
In the game against his team. 
he was the most impressive.

182
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.650
I want to play soccer with him.

183
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.530
Well. you heard him.

184
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.680
Now what? You accepting the offer?

185
00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.760
Of course not.

186
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.420
I'm teaming up with you. Bachira.

187
00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.910
I'm sorry. Nagi.

188
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.610
But I can't join you alone.

189
00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.020
There you go.

190
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.740
I see. Then...

191
00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.450
I'll join Isagi's team.

192
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.620
What?

193
00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:11.830
Huh?

194
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:13.740
That solves the problem. right?

195
00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.670
What...

196
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.410
What are you talking about. Nagi?

197
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:21.470
You're teaming up with me. That's a must.

198
00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:24.050
What are you thinking? What about me?!

199
00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:30.470
Reo. you taught me soccer.

200
00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:33.310
You and I will become the best in the world.

201
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:34.740
That is certain.

202
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.900
But we did lose.

203
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.860
We weren't the strongest.

204
00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:47.120
To understand this feeling of frustration I experienced for the first time.

205
00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.120
I want to play soccer with him.

206
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.910
I really want to give it my all.

207
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:04.680
Are you serious?

208
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.660
Do what you want.

209
00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.210
What do you think. Isagi?

210
00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:16.270
If I could get Kunigami or 
Chigiri. I'd feel reassured.

211
00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.190
And I know that's the best way. But...

212
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.360
But...

213
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.200
I also want to...

214
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.370
Join us. Nagi.

215
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.580
Yup.

216
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:36.790
Form a team of 3 and proceed

217
00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:43.210
Isagi Yoichi
Bachira Meguru
Nagi Seishiro

218
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.210
proceed to 
the 3rd stage

219
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:48.890
See you later. Reo.
 I'll wait for you on the other side.

220
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:55.960
Looking forward to it. Nagicchi!

221
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.390
Yeah. likewise.

222
00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.570
He looked a little sad.

223
00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:03.150
Are you actually a cold person?

224
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:07.610
Huh? I guess I'd be lying 
if I said I don't miss him.

225
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.450
But I was more excited to join you two.

226
00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.830
Shouldn't I be following 
that aspect of my ego?

227
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:17.540
That's the kind of place Blue Lock is.

228
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:24.090
That's right. Only egoists survive here.

229
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:28.470
If they're true egoists. 
I'll see them again after this stage.

230
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:30.720
So for now...

231
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.350
Nagi. let's work together.

232
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.710
Yes. let's.

233
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:40.980
With this team. I don't see how we can lose!

234
00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.820
Seriously. Are we the strongest or what?

235
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.280
Let's go.

236
00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.280
We will win!

237
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.210
Itoshi Rin!

238
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.930
Hello there. diamonds in the rough.

239
00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:13.090
This is the third stage 
of the second selection.

240
00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:16.150
Team battles of three-on-three.

241
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.310
We're facing this guy right off the bat?!

242
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:28.230
Kunigami!

243
00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:29.410
Chigiri!

244
00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:31.780
Good job on clearing the first stage.

245
00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:35.280
You're the only familiar face I see.

246
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:41.290
I talked to the others. and it seems
 Isagi. Bachira. and Nagi formed a team

247
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:43.000
Form a team of 3 and proceed

248
00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:43.020
and went on ahead.

249
00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.380
For real?

250
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.960
So they left me behind. huh? 
That pisses me off.

251
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.970
Yeah. My thoughts exactly.

252
00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.390
So. Kunigami. I have a proposal.

253
00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:01.010
Y'know. Chigiri. I reckon I might
 be thinking the same thing.

254
00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:03.410
Let's team up.

255
00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:03.410
Let's team up.

256
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:12.990
The third stage is a situation battle of 
three-man teams in a mini-game format.

257
00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.880
Blue Lock Man will be
 the goalie for both teams.

258
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.940
and the first team to score five goals wins.

259
00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.720
And the winning team...

260
00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:29.090
will get to steal a player from the 
losing team to create a four-man team.

261
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:26.460
1 player
yoinked

262
00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.540
Steal a player?

263
00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:35.670
Oh. it sounds like that game. 
You know the one. It's called. uh...

264
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:37.020
Red Rover.

265
00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.260
Yeah. that's it.

266
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.300
4-Man Team

267
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.060
As you progress through the stage.
 you acquire more players.

268
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:40.350
4-Man Team

269
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:40.390
4-Man Team

270
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:40.390
4-Man Team

271
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:40.430
4-Man Team

272
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:40.430
4-Man Team

273
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.470
4-Man Team

274
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.520
4-Man Team

275
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:40.560
4-Man Team

276
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:40.600
4-Man Team

277
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:40.640
4-Man Team

278
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:40.640
4-Man Team

279
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.810
4-Man Team

280
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.810
4-Man Team

281
00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:45.810
If you're able to make a team of five 
and get to the fifth stage.

282
00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:42.850
4-Man Team

283
00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:42.850
4-Man Team

284
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:42.890
4-Man Team

285
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:42.890
4-Man Team

286
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:42.930
4-Man Team

287
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:42.930
5-Man Team

288
00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:42.980
4-Man Team

289
00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:42.980
5-Man Team

290
00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:43.020
4-Man Team

291
00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:43.020
5-Man Team

292
00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:43.060
4-Man Team

293
00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:43.060
5-Man Team

294
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:43.100
4-Man Team

295
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:43.100
5-Man Team

296
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:43.140
4-Man Team

297
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:43.140
5-Man Team

298
00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.310
5-Man Team

299
00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:45.350
5-Man Team

300
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.400
5-Man Team

301
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:45.440
5-Man Team

302
00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.980
that team passes the second selection.

303
00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.980
2nd Selection

304
00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.820
And what happens to the losing team?

305
00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.280
They go back down with 
their remaining members.

306
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.780
If you lose the game of two-on-two.

307
00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:59.870
and you don't get picked by the 
winning team. you're disqualified.

308
00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:58.780
Disqualified

309
00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.860
Disqualified

310
00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:07.460
That's the full picture of the second selection
 where you steal your rivals: the Rivalry Battle.

311
00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.300
You're free to choose which team you battle.

312
00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.670
Both teams must agree to play a match.

313
00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:20.270
So more teams of three 
will be showing up here?

314
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.640
I guess so.

315
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:27.100
In that case. these guys don't 
have to be our opponents.

316
00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:29.830
If we can steal a player when we win.

317
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:33.070
then shouldn't we choose which team 
to play based on who we want?

318
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:36.670
Exactly.

319
00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.560
Who you battle will be 
the key to clearing this stage.

320
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:44.450
To serve as an index for you. I will now
 announce new Blue Lock rankings.

321
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:49.290
Naturally. there are 
no fake rankings this time.

322
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.290
New BL Ranking

323
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.120
New BL Ranking

324
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.960
This is the order in which 
you passed the first stage.

325
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.960
New BL Ranking

326
00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:58.680
You stand here because you're all players 
who can turn zero into one on the field.

327
00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:04.470
Hurl your "one" at another's. mix them together.
 and enhance each other to survive.

328
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.150
Only strikers who dominate the 
chemical reaction between ego and ego

329
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:10.990
will get a ticket to the next stage.

330
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.860
Use any means necessary to win.

331
00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:21.660
From here on. it's a battle 
of stealing friends or rivals.

332
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:25.140
That's a pretty nasty rule.

333
00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:29.040
In short. we advance by winning
 and forming a team of five?

334
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.190
Yup.

335
00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:34.230
But anyway. it looks like we can take 
our time picking our opponent.

336
00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.300
What do you want to do. Isagi?

337
00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.630
Should we wait for someone new or...

338
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.930
Oh man. oh man!

339
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:49.430
New BL Ranking

340
00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.440
I don't want to do this.

341
00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:52.520
If we lose...

342
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.310
no one will pick me.

343
00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.610
And if I lose again after that?

344
00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:00.350
Then I'll be all alone!

345
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:04.650
No. no. no! I don't want this!

346
00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:07.580
Huh? His confidence 
seems to be rock bottom.

347
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.350
If we play. it's gotta be against
 fourth. fifth. and sixth.

348

New BL Ranking

349
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.320
That's the glam thing to do.

350
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:20.010
Beating those bumpkins over there
 won't make me look beautiful.

351
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:23.050
Shut up. I don't care who we play.

352

New BL Ranking

353
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.350
I'll just win and move on.

354
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:28.840
You two are here to make up the numbers.

355
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.050
Huh?

356
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.980
I admit your whole look is glam.

357
00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.840
but who do you think you are. 
disregarding me like that?

358
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.400
H-Hey now. Please don't fight.

359
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.870
What's up with these guys?
Aren't they a team?

360
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:45.100
"Glam"?

361
00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.830
I think he means "glamorous."

362
00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.290
Don't get me wrong.

363
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:55.320
We're only a team because 
we passed that last stage quickly.

364
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.700
You're nothing but stepping stones to me.

365
00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.220
You and this Blue Lock.

366
00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.430
I can join the U-20s national 
team if I win this thing.

367
00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:12.080
I'm only here to exploit that system.

368
00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.120
Everything I do is for the purpose of 
getting onto the national team

369
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.020
and surpassing my big brother.

370
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:22.740
Crushing Itoshi Sae is
everything to me in soccer.

371
00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:26.070
I knew it. This guy is...

372
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:30.830
He's the little brother of that 
genius midfielder. Itoshi Sae.

373
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:34.790
Man. how egoistic is this guy?

374
00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:38.750
There are only weirdos in that team.

375
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.370
Hmph. Even your upbringing is glam.

376
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:45.260
You're worthy of being my teammate.

377
00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.250
Teaming up with a star like him?

378
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.720
I know I'll only drag him down.

379
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.810
Bachira. Nagi. I'm sorry.

380
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:57.850
Huh?

381
00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:03.240
I know this is risky. but...

382
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.700
So you don't care who you play?

383
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.630
What?

384
00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:10.950
My ego is telling me:

385
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:13.010
Play us.

386
00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:14.930
I wanna fight him!

387
00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.250
That's the spirit!

388
00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.210
That was my plan.

389
00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:20.420
Huh?

390
00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.090
Are you talking to me?

391
00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:25.800
More importantly...

392
00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.850
Sure. I don't care who I play.

393
00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.860
I want this guy!

394
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:09.640
Blue Lock. Additional Time.

395
00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:07.200

Additional Time!

410
00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.820
Goodbye. bro.

411
00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.960
His Bro Speaks!

412
00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.960
His Bro Speaks!

413
00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.110
This is as far as I go.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:18.540

best striker in the world.

Wanima Keisuke

417
00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.230
I'll become a TV personality 
as your impersonator.

418
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:26.420
My stage name will be "Keisuke Davidson."

419
00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.960
Wanima Junichi

420
00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.960
Wanima Junichi

421
00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.700
See ya. bro!

422
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.880
Make sure you survive!

Leave it to me. Keisuke.

428
00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:42.180
I will crush those who have separated us!

429
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.610
That's what I'm saying.

430
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.680
Wait. he just...

431
00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.320
