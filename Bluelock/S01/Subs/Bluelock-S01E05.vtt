00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.370
The uneasy premonition I felt was coming 
from the beating heart of Team Y.

2
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.460
That's you. Niko!

3
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.670
You have the same eyes as me.

4
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.380
But you can't beat me.

5
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.590
I'm the one controlling this game.

6
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.060
Just you wait. you bastard with bangs.

7
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.930
15 mins in

8
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.930
15 mins in

9
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:42.930
2nd half

10
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:42.930
2nd half

11
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.890
Let's go all-out attack!

12
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.270
Team Z
BL Ranking

13
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.270
nd

14
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.900
Naruhaya's weapon is getting in behind.

15
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.870
Oh. no. you don't!

16
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.950
I'm sorry. Naruhaya!

17
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.410
Yes! Nice!

18
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.440
Press them!

19
00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.370
Get the ball back!

20
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.160
Give it back!

21
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.140
All yours. Niko!

22
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.290
I'll snuff out every single 
pass that comes your way!

23
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.000
You're a pesky one. aren't you?

24
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.740
We'll force our way through.

25
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.930
Let's go again!

26
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.590
Hey. Isagi! It's time to use your weapon!

27
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.510
Stay put! We'll carry on 
using Naruhaya's formation!

28
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.190
Huh? Are you sure?

29
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.950
Yeah!

30
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.930
Instead of going up top 
and upsetting our balance.

31
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.440
if I stop him here. it gives us
 a better chance of scoring.

32
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.950
You all heard Ego's speech about 
"taking up your weapon." too. right?

33
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.190
What about it?

34
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.700
It got me thinking...

35
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.910
"What is my weapon?"

36
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.380
Gagamaru. it's all yours!

37
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.200
Everyone here at Blue Lock 
has incredible talent.

38
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.990
Okay!

39
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.130
There's no way I can outperform
Ohkawa-kun when it comes to shooting.

40
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.340
But I can't afford to lose.

41
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.800
I can't run fast. and I don't
 have a muscular physique.

42
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.930
So my weapons to survive this place are:

43
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.470
my eyes that can accurately 
read the situation on the field.

44
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.010
and my brain that excels
at coordinating people.

45
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.110
You may manage to stop me. 
but you can't stop my ideas.

46
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.590
What does that mean?

47
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.030
35 mins in

48
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.030
35 mins in

49
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.030
2nd half

50
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.030
2nd half

51
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.460
All right! My weapon's 
my never-say-die attitude!

52
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.570
Team Z
BL Ranking

53
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.570
th

54
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.990
Amen!

55
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.240
Don't let him get the ball!

56
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.120
Pass it around!

57
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.700
Damn!

58
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.960
All they're doing is playing keep-ball! 
Are they settling for a draw?

59
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.920
I'm stopping Ohkawa from linking up 
with Niko for a counterattack.

60
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.520
It's not that they won't attack...
They have no one who can start one!

61
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.840
Then. all we have to do 
is attack! Let's move up!

62
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.020
If we score. we win! 
Let's take them down!

63
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.200
There's no time left! Get the ball!

64
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.670
One minute left. It's almost time.

65
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.400
For our last resort.

66
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.270
It's a revenge tactic we only use when 
we're tied and completely hemmed in.

67
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.640
Corner him!

68
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.270
Block their passing lanes!

69
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.610
The go sign...

70
00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.730
is Ohkawa-kun picking up 
the ball in his own half.

71
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.500
And unlike the previous 89 minutes. 
it won't be Ohkawa-kun going on a solo run.

72
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.580
In the last minute...

73
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.160
the whole of Team Y joins the attack.

74
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.650
We call it the "One-Time Kill Counter."

75
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.510
Crap. They tricked us.

76
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.020
We committed too many to the attack.

77
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.120
Our defense is exposed.

78
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.280
If they score now...

79
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.850
we lose!

80
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.560
No...

81
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.300
I...

82
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.580
Are you serious?!

83
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.540
Stop him!

84
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.150
Get back! Get back!

85
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.200
This is bad! Someone stop him!

86
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.990
Last defender. it's up to you!

87
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.530
One on one.

88
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.820
If I don't save this. my... 
No. all of our soccer careers end here.

89
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.440
I'm going to save it. no matter what!

90
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.630
Ohkawa?

91
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.870
It's over...

92
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.430
We're screwed.

93
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.740
It's here. isn't it. Niko?

94
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.080
This is the place that 
smells most like a goal.

95
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.460
You and I are alike.

96
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.290
We have the same eyes. 
and we think the same.

97
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.380
So rather than taking the shot yourself. 
you passed it to Ohkawa so he could finish us off.

98
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.340
I win. Niko.

99
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.970
You chose to pass at the very 
last moment. which means...

100
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.760
You're unfit to be a striker!

101
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.850
Shit! They're countering!

102
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.350
Get back! Steal the ball!

103
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.430
I chose to pass rather than taking the 
shot myself. then we lost. and I cried.

104
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.420
I don't need that version of myself anymore.

105
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.130
I want to win!

106
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.310
Now is the time to be reborn!

107
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.040
Nice. Isagi!

108
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.910
Foul him if you have to! Just stop him!

109
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.090
Damn it!

110
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.960
It's up to you!

111
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.210
Duly noted.

112
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.890
Stop him!

113
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:25.790
Come on!

114
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.850
I'll leave the rest to you.

115
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.440
That's so low. But...

116
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.170
I'll take it!

117
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.650
Ah! He missed it?!

118
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.570
No.

119
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.570
I was aiming beyond him...

120
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.590
...at Number 11.

121
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.620
How is he there?

122
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.950
Go.

123
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.460
Score it. you egoist...

124
00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.660
Isagi Yoichi!

125
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.710
I'm... a striker.

126
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:22.610
Time's up. Team Z wins Blue Lock 
Building 5's fourth match. 2-1.

127
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.550
Hell yeah. Isagi!

128
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.060
All right!

129
00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.130
Yeah!

130
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.150
Nice one!

131
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.690
Nice! Nice. Isagi!

132
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.740
You're amazing. man! What a finish!

133
00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.310
How far did you run?!

134
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.050
Huh? What?

135
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.450
Where's he going?

136
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.260
Damn it!

137
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.640
I crushed... the dreams 
of these eleven people.

138
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.090
My goal did this.

139
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.830
Tch.

140
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.130
So this is what it means to win.

141
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.110
Huh.

142
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.230
What is this feeling?

143
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.330
It feels so good!

144
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.920
Episode 5

145
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.920
To Be Reborn

146
00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:04.310
Let us toast Team Z's victory
 in our second game. Cheers!

147
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.520
Cheers!

148
00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.650
Okay. dig in. everyone.

149
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.180
I missed you. meat! So good!

150
00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.400
This is the heavenly taste of victory!

151
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.530
Mmm. delish. delish!

152
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:19.100
Hey! This meat is the bonus 
for the goals Isagi and I scored.

153
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.700
I know we're sharing it. 
but leave some for me!

154
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.410
Yummy!

155
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.640
Hey! That's mine! Spit it out!

156
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.540
Okay. everyone. we're going 
to do this potluck style.

157
00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.250
We'll get to taste each other's 
dishes. so no fighting.

158
00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:34.240
Oh. wow!

159
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.840
Are you a lunch lady?

160
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.560
Hey. I see gyoza.

161
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.550
Pacific saury!

162
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.800
Natto's not bad every once in a while.

163
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.350
Here's my pickled radish!

164
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:43.790
No. thanks.

165
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.730
But how did you know to get 
yourself into that position?

166
00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.440
Oh. that's a point. Did you know 
the ball would end up there?

167
00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:49.960
I give.

168
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.440
I give.

169
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.650
Oh. no. it's not like I actually knew...

170
00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:01.890
I just wanted to take a shot and took 
a chance that it might fall around there.

171
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:05.120
But I saw you. Isagi. Good job!

172
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.990
Thanks for the pass. Bachira.

173
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.040
Here's your reward! Say "ah"!

174
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.370
Um. I can feed myself.

175
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.210
Don't be shy. Take it. Pass!

176
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:18.450
Anyhow. it seems Isagi's weapon 
is being able to "smell" a goal.

177
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.090
And thanks to Isagi's goal. we won.

178
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.060
That's a fact.

179
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.940
Hmph. I refuse to acknowledge that.

180
00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.400
Well. whatever the case. we won.

181
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.350
We'll survive this. Team Z!

182
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:34.870
Yeah!

183
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.150
More food!

184
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.530
I've got plenty more room.

185
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:38.780
Let me get some. too.

186
00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:48.270
No more... pickled radish...

187
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.540
Jeez. he's the worst!

188
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:54.130
Though...

189
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:57.060
I'm too psyched to go to sleep!

190
00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:04.430
It really was me who won that game 
for us. wasn't it? With my goal.

191
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.930
It was me who crushed them.

192
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.400
It felt so good.

193
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:16.650
I can't put it into words. It was
 like nothing I've ever experienced.

194
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.640
Wait. does that make me a jerk?

195
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.410
That's not good.

196
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.580
Building 5. Team Z

197
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:27.580
Monitoring Room

198
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.000
Chigiri.

199
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.370
Isagi.

200
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.330
What are you doing here?

201
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:38.680
Oh. I couldn't sleep. so I came
 to watch the game footage.

202
00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.690
You?

203
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.550
I couldn't sleep. either.

204
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.010
So I was watching your goal.

205
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:44.700
Huh?

206
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:49.270
It's no wonder you can't 
fall asleep after that goal.

207
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.850
As a striker. it must have
 been a glorious moment.

208
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.820
Yeah. it was like...

209
00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:00.900
It was a goal I would've never 
scored if I hadn't come to Blue Lock.

210
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:05.410
I'll always remember this goal.

211
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.430
But I couldn't do it again. 
even if someone told me to.

212
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.570
I just ran without really thinking.

213
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:18.800
I believe you have very 
keen spatial awareness.

214
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.060
Hm? What's that?

215
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:26.930
Most players judge a situation based on 
what they see in their direct field of vision.

216
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:34.730
And that field of vision gets smaller 
when running at top speed or dribbling.

217
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.790
But on occasion.

218
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:42.040
you play like you can see the whole field 
and everything that's happening on it.

219
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.780
Kind of like you're a god
 looking down from above.

220
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:52.950
That skill helped you 
"smell" a goal and avert a crisis.

221
00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.460
and made an impossible goal a reality.

222
00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.220
Spatial awareness.

223
00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.900
That's my weapon?

224
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:08.770
You're only doing it intuitively right now. 
so if you can learn to do it intentionally.

225
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.720
your eyes and brain will be 
a weapon like no other.

226
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.560
That's what I was thinking
 watching the video.

227
00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.680
Oh. I get it now. Thanks. Chigiri.

228
00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.220
You just gave me a great pointer.

229
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.260
You're always frowning. 
but you're actually a nice guy.

230
00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:28.240
It's nothing.

231
00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.990
I'm only telling you so the team wins.

232
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.710
By the way. what's your weapon?

233
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:35.910
You didn't tell us the other day.

234
00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:39.900
Like I said. I don't want to say.

235
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.450
Huh? Why not? Tell me.

236
00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.900
I'll help you out if I can.

237
00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.970
I want to know more about you.

238
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:51.520
Just drop it. We don't need to talk about me.

239
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.940
Yes. we do. It's important.

240
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.500
A right ACL tear.

241
00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:07.230
That's the injury I picked up a year ago.

242
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:16.220
The doc said if I injure the same spot again.
 my playing days will be in jeopardy.

243
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.410
I used to have it. Isagi.

244
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.090
I used to have an amazing weapon like you.

245
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:27.750
plus nights where I couldn't sleep 
because I was so pumped from scoring.

246
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.940
and a dream of becoming
 the world's greatest striker.

247
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:36.470
But even though my leg's healed.
 I'm scared I'll get injured again.

248
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:41.400
I'm scared of losing my dream. and the 
soccer that's given me so much pleasure.

249
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.110
I came to Blue Lock to find a 
reason to give up on my dream.

250
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:53.510
Isagi. I might be able to give up 
on it after seeing your goal.

251
00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.410
Stop lying. Chigiri.

252
00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.140
Don't blame it on me.

253
00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.420
I know you don't really want to give up.

254
00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.870
I'm the same.

255
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:09.020
I'm scared that all of this
 might end. so I fight.

256
00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:14.470
If you're not prepared to give up everything.
 you'll never fulfill your dream!

257
00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.140
You know nothing about me.

258
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.730
A progress report on this project
 to the JFU is almost due.

259
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.490
So how are we doing...

260
00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:32.410
Japan Football Union 
New Member of the Team

261
00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:32.410
Ego-san?

262
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.120
Hold on a moment. Anri-chan.

263
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:37.700
Blue Lock Project Representative

264
00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.070
I am about to experience bliss.

265
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:37.870
Blue Lock Project Representative

266
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:38.040
Blue Lock Project Representative

267
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.080
Blue Lock Project Representative

268
00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:40.580
Shoyu 
Ramen

269
00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:40.580
Shoyu 
Ramen

270
00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:40.580
Spicy

271
00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:40.580
Piquant
Soup!

272
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:40.660
Shoyu 
Ramen

273
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:40.660
Shoyu 
Ramen

274
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:40.660
Spicy

275
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:40.660
Piquant
Soup!

276
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.540
Again. Ego-san? Don't you eat anything else?

277
00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:40.790
Spicy

278
00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:40.790
Piquant
Soup!

279
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.130
It's overcompensation.

280
00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:44.670
Sauce

281
00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:44.750
Sauce

282
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:45.000
Sauce

283
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:45.090
Sauce

284
00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:45.170
Sauce

285
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:45.250
Sauce

286
00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:45.340
Sauce

287
00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:45.420
Sauce

288
00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:45.500
Sauce

289
00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:49.510
My dietary regimen when I used 
to play meant I couldn't eat it.

290
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.800
so now that I can. 
I only eat this stuff.

291
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:57.050
At least clean up a little and 
do some laundry. Seriously...

292
00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.890
I refuse to do anything 
that can be done by others.

293
00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:04.040
And my contract says I don't have to do 
anything unrelated to soccer. right?

294
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:09.190
Well. anyway. is Blue Lock's 
first selection process going well?

295
00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:09.360
Spice

296
00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:11.400
Yup. it's going real well.

297
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:09.530
Spice

298
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:09.700
Spice

299
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:09.860
Spice

300
00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:10.030
Spice

301
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.190
Spice

302
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:10.360
Spice

303
00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:10.530
Spice

304
00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:10.700
Spice

305
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:10.860
Spice

306
00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:11.030
Spice

307
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.190
Spice

308
00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:11.400
Spice

309
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.410
Just you watch. It's time to add some spice.

310
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:21.470
Okay. Isagi. you missed. so you're done.

311
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:22.670
You suck.

312
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.070
Ha. that goal really was a fluke.

313
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.390
Come on. let's continue with our practice.

314
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.550
Aw. damn.

315
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:33.720
All right! To me!

316
00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.970
Move up faster!

317
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:38.980
Everyone else really is better than me.

318
00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.640
Their stamina's off the chart. too.

319
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:47.410
I now know that my weapon is "smelling" a goal.
 My spatial awareness. in other words.

320
00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:51.740
But I'm not exactly sure how to use it.

321
00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.570
You know nothing about me.

322
00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:01.270
I pissed Chigiri off by saying 
something unnecessary.

323
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.930
I drag everyone down in practice.

324
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.740
Something needs to change.

325
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.720
I don't want this to end with me
 only scoring one fluky goal.

326
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:15.410
Hello there. diamonds in the rough.

327
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:19.720
Yup. sauce and mayo are the perfect combo.

328
00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.620
Ego...

329
00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:21.930
Those noodles look yummy.

330
00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:23.060
Yummy.

331
00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:23.890
So yummy.

332
00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:27.860
So the sixth round just finished.

333
00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:29.900
Here are the results and the table.

334
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.050
Bam!

335
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:31.610
Match 6

336
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:31.610
Match 6

337
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:31.610
Match 5

338
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:31.610
Match 5

339
00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.610
Points

340
00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.610
Points

341
00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.610
Goal Difference

342
00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.610
Goal Difference

343
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.600
Three teams are tied on one win. one loss?

344
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.780
Team V's got a huge lead.

345
00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:41.490
Which means if we don't win the next 
game against Team W. we're in trouble.

346
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.450
And here's some spice.

347
00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:51.090
Your player rankings are being adjusted
based on your achievements and play so far.

348
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:56.880
As a striker. you must prove 
your worth with goals.

349
00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.050
Igarashi Gurimu

350
00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.170
The more valuable your goals are. 
the higher your ranking.

351
00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.180
Chigiri Hyoma

352
00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:02.220
Naruhaya Asahi

353
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:03.220
Iemon Okuhito

354
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:04.270
Imamura Yudai

355
00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:04.470
Raichi Jingo

356
00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:04.470
Kuon Wataru

357
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.470
Which means the top-ranking 
player in Team Z is...

358
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.470
Bachira Meguru

359
00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.470
Gagamaru Gin

360
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:04.470
Kunigami Rensuke

361
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.180
It's you...

362
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.420
Isagi Yoichi.

363
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.400
Gagamaru Gin

364
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.400
Kunigami Rensuke

365
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.400
Isagi Yoichi

366
00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:15.870
I... I'm the top-ranked player on this team?

367
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.470
Damn it.

368
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:21.520
Finding your weapon is the first 
requirement of being a striker.

369
00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.330
The next step is to polish 
your weapon and improve it.

370
00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:29.580
Make it stand out.

371
00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:34.480
Let's take the world-famous Argentinian
 striker. Lionel Messi. as an example.

372
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:39.040
His weapon is his unique 
and graceful speedy dribbling.

373
00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.130
and how fast he swings his leg
 on his left-footed shot.

374
00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:46.520
In those aspects. he's the most 
prominent player on the planet.

375
00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:50.780
This is why he continues to reign as one of the world's best strikers.

376
00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.650
Each of you has a different weapon.

377
00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:56.980
So naturally. how you 
polish it will also be different.

378
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.530
Just copying Messi won't 
make your weapon shine.

379
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:08.000
So how do you enhance your unique 
weapon that turns "zero" into "one"?

380
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.330
Find your one-of-a-kind play
 and make it stand out.

381
00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:17.340
Your talent is a fierce gemstone that turns 
into worthless complacency if you don't polish it.

382
00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.880
Match 7

383
00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.880
Time to Kick-off

384
00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.440
We have a game in 24 hours.

385
00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.390
We should go check out the 
video footage of Team W.

386
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:30.000
Okay. let's call it a day and get ready 
for tomorrow. Good work. everyone.

387
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.480
Good work!

388
00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.190
Okay.

389
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.050
Bath time!

390
00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:34.310
Time to eat!

391
00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.940
"Make it stand out." huh?

392
00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.260
What do I polish. and how?

393
00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:48.660
I mean. my weapon isn't something that's 
easy to see like dribbling or shooting.

394
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:54.610
"Smelling" a goal is just 
something that comes to me.

395
00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:56.060
Oh!

396
00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.540
I don't know exactly 
when it'll come to me.

397
00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.450
but if I'm exhausted when it does.
 the chance will go begging.

398
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:03.720
That's it.

399
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.800
It's my physique I need to polish.

400
00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.690
Then I can run for the full 90 minutes. 
and do what I need to when the time comes.

401
00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.730
I will win. I will stand out.

402
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.400
Hey now. Are you doing secret 
running training to get a jump on us?

403
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:24.280
If Team Z's top-ranked player
is doing it. I gotta follow suit!

404
00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.570
Kunigami.

405
00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:27.650
Hey. no fair. Count me in. too.

406
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:28.500
Bachira?!

407
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.870
Huh? Haven't you realized yet. Isagi?

408
00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.330
Team Z already...

409
00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.250
revolves around you.

410
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.460
I am not gonna lose to you!

411
00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:40.170
Me neither!

412
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:43.130
Aw. man. I wanted to take a bath.

413
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:45.090
We're gonna win tomorrow.

414
00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:45.800
Yeah!

415
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.510
I'm gonna be the best in the world!

416
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.140
I can't let Isagi upstage me!

417
00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:52.230
Guys...

418
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:58.770
I wasn't on anyone's radar until recently.

419
00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:03.930
I thought my soccer career 
would dissolve with my tears.

420
00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:07.990
But now. everyone's chasing after me!

421
00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.710
I'm number one.

422
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:17.380
I can be reborn here.

423
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:23.340
Someone ranked lower than you got 
ahead of you. Of course you'd be fired up.

424
00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:28.560
The existence of one outstanding player 
can create a spiral of rivalry.

425
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.360
That's Blue Lock.

426
00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:35.480
The world's greatest 
striker will only appear...

427
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.980
where the soccer is most intense.

428
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.210
A

429
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.370
Blue Lock. Additional Time.

430
00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:11.370
Additional Time!

431
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:11.580
Additional Time!

432
00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:11.790
Additional Time!

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:12.000

Blue Lock

437
00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:12.960
Blue Lock

438
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.000
Blue Lock

439
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.040
Blue Lock

440
00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:13.250
Blue Lock

441
00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:13.250
Additional Time!

442
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:14.000
Blue Lock

443
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:14.000
Additional Time!

444
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.980
Introducing Blue Lock's Supplies!

445
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.980
Introducing Blue Lock's Supplies!

446
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:17.740
Check this out! And this one! And this!

447
00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.750
It's all stuff custom-made for Blue Lock.

Let's put our names on our toothbrushes.
or we won't be able to tell 'em apart.

456
00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.380
Understood.

457

Iemon Okuhito

459
00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.680
Hm...

460
00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:39.180
Your handwriting is a mirror

461
00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:39.180
Your handwriting is a mirror 
that reflects who you are as a person.

462
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:39.180
Iemon

463
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:39.180
that reflects who you are as a person

464
00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.180
Iemon Okuhito

465
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.040
It's done.

466
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.870
Look! This is mine.

467
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.830
It's a dolphin.

468
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:53.290
Raichi Jingo

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:53.290
Raichi Jingo

470
00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:53.290
Mine says "Mine" on it. Use it and I'll kill you.

471
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:53.290
Mine

472
00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:55.830
Gagamaru

473
00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.830
Gagamaru's handwriting is terrible!

474
00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.430
Seriously. is it your first time 
writing letters or something?

475
00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:07.290
I'm not all that confident 
I can coexist with these guys...
