00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.910
Fingerprint Authentication

2
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.920
For the second selection. we're using mini 
fields customized to the number of players.

3
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.500
We're also using mini goals.

4
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.990
Your goalie will be Blue Lock Man. 
equipped with the same skills as before.

5
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.060
If you win. you steal a player from the 
other team and move on to the next stage.

6
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.600
Our Blue Lock Man's white.

7
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.600
It's cyber as hell.

8
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.560
If you lose. you lose a player 
and go back to the previous stage.

9
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.560
Nice working with you. sir!

10
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.690
It's three-on-three.
First to five wins.

11
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.620
The second selection. 
third stage: Rivalry Battle.

12
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.030
It doesn't matter if our 
opponents are ranked higher.

13
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.620
I want to test my skills against 
these guys ranked #1. #2. and #3!

14
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.230
Then I'll win and make
 Itoshi Rin join my team!

15
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.010
Episode 13

16
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.470
2nd Selection

17
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.470
3rd Stage

18
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.770
Here we go!

19
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.570
Tokimitsu. you mark Blunt Bangs.

20
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.490
Huh? Um. okay.

21
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.650
The rankings simply reflect the order in 
which we cleared the first stage. right?

22
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.020
Wow! Scissors?!

23
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.120
So fast!

24
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.160
Ah. sorry. He got past me.

25
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.500
I leveled up from that training
with Blue Lock Man. you see.

26
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.780
Nice. Bachira!

27
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.370
Next up is Rin-chan. You ready. Isagi?

28
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.090
Yeah!

29
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.800
Let's go. Bachira. A one-two pass.

30
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.720
But that's a feint.

31
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:20.720
Nagi.

32
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.680
Yup.

33
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.630
I have arrived.

34
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.560
I'll stop you. glam-style.

35
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.930
At this distance and this timing...

36
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.860
It's within your range. Isagi.

37
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.740
Nice. Nagi.

38
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.000
Such a delicately caressed pass.

39
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.830
Focus on the connection. 
Don't use any more force than necessary.

40
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.200
This is...

41
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.620
my new direct shot!

42
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.000
Eat it!

43
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.630
Yay!

44
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.480
Isagi. I think your shots 
are getting more accurate.

45
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.570
Yeah. they're very efficient now.

46
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.390
Thanks to that training. 
I've definitely gone up a level.

47
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.010
Plus. we're launching attacks made possible
 because we understand each other's weapons.

48
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.360
Nice work. Nagicchi.

49
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.010
It was thanks to your great pass.

50
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.760
We're good enough.

51
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.610
Right? Wasn't that fun?

52
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.360
I mean. we're seriously strong!

53
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.990
Oh. man! What do we do?

54
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.720
We can beat the top three!

55
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.820
That goal was totally glam.

56
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.780
Okay. I get the picture.

57
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.690
You're operating at such a low level. 
I might actually die of boredom.

58
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:39.290
I bet you still think of this act 
of combat using a ball as a sport.

59
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.630
Seriously. I don't need your sort.

60
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.770
This is a battlefield.

61
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.850
What you're doing right now is turning
your back on a soldier with a gun.

62
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.790
That's why you're not good enough.

63
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.110
Straight from the kickoff?

64
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.640
Holy crap.

65
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.020
Is that legal?

66
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.210
Yup. totally.

67
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.920
But it usually never comes off.

68
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.970
A s-super goal?

69
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.550
Hey. that was too glam.

70
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.140
Don't go making plays by 
yourself without telling me.

71
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.020
Like I said. I don't care.

72
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.350
Friend or foe. you're all 
half-baked NPCs to me.

73
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.400
Let's finish this quickly.

74
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.150
This is seriously a waste of time.

75
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:43.820
Hey. hold up a minute.

76
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.630
We're putting our lives 
on the line to be here.

77
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.280
Just like us. you play soccer 
to realize your dream too. right?

78
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:52.540
Dream?

79
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.130
It's nothing as dull and complacent as that.

80
00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.400
Losing in soccer means 
losing your reason to exist.

81
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.060
In other words. it's the same as dying.

82
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.970
To me. soccer is
 a fight to the death.

83
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.190
F-Fight to the death?

84
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.390
Wow. weirdo alert.

85
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.100
He's nuts.

86
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.600
This guy sounds like a bother.

87
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.760
Just come at me already.
 so I can finish you off.

88
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.820
Your halfhearted game 
of kickabout ends here.

89
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.780
Now you've pissed me off.

90
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.790
Interesting.

91
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.990
Let's fight to the death. then.

92
00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.500
Rin might be incredible. 
but this is a three-on-three team battle.

93
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.170
I'll make him regret 
underestimating me and my team.

94
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.590
Rin-chan...

95
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.170
I'm not gonna let you touch it.

96
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.140
So gentle. Nice pass. Bachira.

97
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.360
How high?!

98
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.680
Shoot. He saw through it.

99
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.890
GLAM

100
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.890
GLAM

101
00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.900
I have descended.

102
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.520
Your touch might be glam. but if you 
don't get to touch it. it can't shine.

103
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.240
That was one sick jump. 
I'm over 190cm tall. you know.

104
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.200
Tokimitsu. pass it to me.
 Right in front of the goal.

105
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.200
Huh? What? What?

106
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.450
Aryu-kun!

107
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:15.580
Ah. you got in the way!

108
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:16.450
It went thataway.

109
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:17.910
Nice block. Bachira!

110
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.460
If I lose the ball in this situation.
 it could prove fatal.

111
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.420
For now. I have to be cautious...

112
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.010
What? I was shielding the ball 
but he still managed to steal it?

113
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.300
From that position?

114
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:39.430
Usually. I'd get bumped into there and 
win the foul. Just how long are his limbs?!

115
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.520
Incredible jumps and greater reach
 than your typical Japanese person...

116
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.730
Aryu... He's another kind of monster!

117
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.610
GLAM

118
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.610
GLAM

119
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.700
On this field right now. 
I am the most glam of all. for sure.

120
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.570
I'm sorry. I never expected him
 to shoot from there.

121
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.160
Don't sweat it. Mr. Glammy 
Long Legs is also crazy. huh?

122
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.950
Which means he's worth beating.

123
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.840
Give it to me. Isagi.

124
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.370
How should we attack?

125
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:11.170
Hm?

126
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.970
If passes aren't getting
 through to Nagicchi...

127
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.470
I'll slice through 'em myself!

128
00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.180
Huh? Wait. what?!

129
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.140
Try and stop me. Slanty Brows!

130
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.020
Oh no. I've got to stop you.
 You're coming at me?

131
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.480
I guess. I mean. your feet aren't moving.

132
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.980
Ah. what do I do?

133
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:32.190
If I lose here. I'll go back to being useless.

134
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.920
I've worked so hard and come so far.

135
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.120
I finally gained some
 self-confidence through soccer.

136
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.830
Aw. man. I don't want this.

137
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.080
Ah. I'm being negative again.
 I hate it when I'm like this.

138
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.420
I want confidence!

139
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:47.920
He sped up?

140
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.170
I can still get past him though.

141
00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.130
I don't like this!

142
00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.840
What? But I was already past him.

143
00:08:58.090 --> 00:08:59.220
In that case...

144
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.910
I'll just leave him in my dust!

145
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.520
He stopped Bachira one-on-one?

146
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.370
He was slow to react. too.

147
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.480
His quickness is off the charts!

148
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.780
This is no good. I want a goal.

149
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.610
Without a goal. I feel insecure.

150
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.700
Goal. goal. goal!

151
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:16.850
Has he gone crazy?

152
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.160
Stop him. Isagi.

153
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.450
Get out of the way!

154
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.330
Right? Or left? Which way?

155
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.160
Damn it! If I have to foul him. I will!

156
00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.510
What is this raw power?

157
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.840
Is he a bullet made of pure muscle?!

158
00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.800
Oh. this may work.

159
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.500
What the hell is with this guy?

160
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.260
Yay. I did it!

161
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.100
Are these guys for real?

162
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.100
Oh. oops. I shouldn't be happy.

163
00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:49.060
Oh no. If I get carried away. 
people will hate me and I'll lose all of this.

164
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.060
New BL Ranking

165
00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.330
Tokimitsu. are you a psycho?

166
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:55.030
New BL Ranking

167
00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.030
So in the new Blue Lock rankings...

168
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.550
Hurry up and restart.

169
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.990
New BL Ranking

170
00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.550
...this is how skilled the top three are!

171
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:04.680
It wasn't just Rin who possessed
extraordinary weapons.

172
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.280
Aw. this sucks!

173
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:10.590
I mean. these guys have only just met. 
and they don't have an ounce of teamwork.

174
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.560
That's not very glam of you.

175
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.050
What am I gonna do?

176
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.860
They're fighting separately
using their individual skills.

177
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.220
I'm telling you. that's not very glam.

178
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.960
I'm totally screwed!

179
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:18.130
By contrast. we've been fighting 
together in the same building.

180
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.470
and we understand each other.

181
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.960
So why is there such a gap?

182
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.870
Why is this happening?

183
00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.390
Does this mean we're going to... lose this?

184
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.670
Wow. So there are still 
players like that out there.

185
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.110
Soccer really is interesting.

186
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.110
Nagi...

187
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:47.450
I can see things this way 
thanks to you. Isagi.

188
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.030
I promise I'll make it 
more interesting next.

189
00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:06.190
Are they having a strategy meeting?

190
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:09.710
Oh no. They'll come at us for real
 this time. I just know it.

191
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:15.070
I see. So that's the type of soccer 
Nagicchi wants the three of us to play. huh?

192
00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:18.130
Yes. I think it'll be interesting.

193
00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:21.910
I like it! And after all. we gotta do 
something. What do you think. Isagi?

194
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:26.020
I'm for it. too. That might be the 
best way to go up against those three.

195
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:31.870
But Nagi. I didn't know you were the type
 to actively suggest ideas and junk.

196
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.580
I'm not. This is the first time I've done so.

197
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:39.550
I don't want to lose and 
feel like that ever again.

198
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.680
It's no fun if I don't win.

199
00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.510
Ain't that the truth?

200
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.970
Yeah. Let's go!

201
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.440
First to five wins.

202
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.150
If they score two more goals. we lose.

203
00:11:54.440 --> 00:12:00.240
Nagi can't move freely because of 
Aryu's incredible jumping and long limbs.

204
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.030
The same goes for Bachira.

205
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:06.530
His dribbling weapon is canceled out by
Tokimitsu's extraordinary quickness.

206
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.440
If we fight with these
 individual matchups. we lose.

207
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:16.520
That's why we'll stay within 15 meters 
of each other. so we won't be isolated.

208
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.370
and we can use this triangle
 to chip away at them.

209
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.300
Bachira's the anchor.

210
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:26.720
He'll choose the route that will lead our 
triangle to the area in front of the goal.

211
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:34.060
But we can't hang onto the ball for too long. 
so Isagi and I will play one-touch soccer.

212
00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:41.970
This will only work if my touch and 
Isagi's direct play are pinpoint accurate.

213
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:42.900
This will do it!

214
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.490
Like Nagi outlined. 
if we can't win the one-on-ones.

215
00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:49.190
we need to create a situation 
where it's a three-on-three.

216
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:50.450
By doing it this way.

217
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.160
we can control the midfield!

218
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.860
They're starting to string
 some passes together.

219
00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.630
I will stop him. glam-style.

220
00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.960
But with Aryu at my back. 
I'm not the one who'll finish this move.

221
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.420
That's you. Isagi.

222
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.020
When we reach the area in front of the goal.

223
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:10.810
use your eyes to gauge the right timing and
 range. then dash to where you'll shoot from.

224
00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:11.890
I see it! Now!

225
00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.850
That's where it's open!

226
00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:16.060
Okay. partner. That's where you want it!

227
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.940
That's some half-baked link-up play.

228
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:26.360
Did you think I wouldn't 
be able to see what you see?

229
00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.090
Rin? Seriously? He spotted 
where I wanted to shoot from?

230
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:31.080
You're kidding.

231
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.360
Ah. he stopped them!

232
00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.370
In that case...

233
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:34.080
Nagi!

234
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.330
A fast ground pass.

235
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:40.440
But that won't work. since I can't 
be a part of the triangle now.

236
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.250
Oh.

237
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.710
That's right. Feel it.

238
00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.050
It's a gift from me to you.

239
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.510
The ball has some crazy spin on it.
 Interesting. Okay.

240
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.570
So you're telling me not to kill it dead.

241
00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.560
That's what I'm sensing.

242
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.520
Bingo.

243
00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.480
Wow.

244
00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:02.440
So this is what happens when talents meet.

245
00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.390
This is Nagi and Bachira's
 chemical reaction!

246
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.780
Only strikers who dominate the 
chemical reaction between ego and ego

247
00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.580
will get a ticket to the next stage.

248
00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.730
Nice one. Nagi and Bachira.

249
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:20.380
Right. It wasn't what I expected. though. 
I didn't know passes like that existed.

250
00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:26.380
With Reo's passes. it was always 
a case of "do whatever you feel like."

251
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.590
But that pass from Bachira...

252
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:33.310
It felt like it was shoving 
an idea into my brain.

253
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.020
Addictive. isn't it?

254
00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.730
Yeah. How many more do we want?

255
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:42.690
We use our triangle to control the midfield.
and in the final phase. I initiate a move.

256
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:47.930
and with Bachira's inspiration and Nagi's 
intuition to respond to it. we steal a goal.

257
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.530
That's our soccer!

258
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.530
Well. let's get one more to start with.

259
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.450
Okay. got it.

260
00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:55.130
Then. what I can do now is—

261
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.410
You're having a chat on a battlefield?

262
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.330
Don't you ever learn?

263
00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.090
I'm staking my life on every moment here.

264
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.220
Crap.

265
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.590
Yay! Another goal!

266
00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.730
What I can do is see the 
future and sense danger!

267
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.190
Isagi!

268
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:27.190
I can see what you see. you know.

269
00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:29.990
You're half-baked. too. Itoshi Rin.

270
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.220
Their weapons. their play styles...
 It's all stored in my brain!

271
00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:39.580
From here on out. I will control 
the field with these eyes of mine!

272
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.290
Team Red's ball.

273
00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.660
Restart with a corner kick.

274
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.000
Corner kick taker:

275
00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.000
Itoshi Rin

276
00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.790
Bachira's marking Tokimitsu. 
who's really good at losing people.

277
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:49.090
Please move.

278
00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:50.010
No way!

279
00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.210
All chances exist for me.

280
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:53.680
and Nagi's on Aryu. 
who's good in aerial battles.

281
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:53.680
You're too much.

282
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.090
The position I should take up is right here. 
so I can respond to what either of them do.

283
00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:02.140
Occupying this space is ideal if I want 
to limit the taker's passing options.

284
00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.270
We'll get through this crisis 
and find a way to counter.

285
00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.570
I will turn this crisis into opportunity!

286
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.530
So high. A pass to Aryu?

287
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.070
No! It's over our heads?

288
00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.000
A vertical spin direct shot?!

289
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:30.230
This guy took a shot at goal
 from a corner kick.

290
00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.580
Wow. a-amazing.

291
00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.890
You just did something 
even more glam than me.

292
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:40.910
That was unreasonable.

293
00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.350
How are we supposed to stop that?

294
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:47.000
Damn it. Did I misread the situation?

295
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.960
If I'd been standing on the far post. 
could I have stopped that?

296
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.980
No. that would have left 
the space I'm currently in wide open.

297
00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.840
For me. it was the only 
logical position to take up.

298
00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.640
If they score one more goal. we lose.

299
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:00.950
Crap.

300
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:04.710
We just need to score three 
more goals before that happens.

301
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.250
Yeah. it's time to counter.

302
00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:12.360
Our three-man soccer can't end here!

303
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.230
Good!

304
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:20.470
With our triangle. 
we can control the midfield.

305
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.310
All we need is an idea 
that can finish off the move.

306
00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:27.230
Earlier. Rin read the final pass to me.

307
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:30.360
We managed to score thanks to 
Nagi and Bachira's chemical reaction.

308
00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.280
but a goal like that can't 
be reproduced too often.

309
00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.280
I need to create a 
chemical reaction this time.

310
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.990
What can I do?

311
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:42.490
How long are you going 
to pass the ball around?

312
00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:45.630
You call yourself a striker?

313
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.630
Come on. I'll end you.

314
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.970
Don't underestimate me. Rin.

315
00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:56.420
If you mark me that tightly. 
you're leaving a massive space behind you.

316
00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.980
Bachira!

317
00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:58.890
Right here!

318
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.680
I'll create the smell of a goal!

319
00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.850
Did you spot a good space?

320
00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:11.690
Go find a book on how the human eye works
 and learn something. you piece of trash.

321
00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.150
Huh? What?

322
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.880
I thought I'd totally got in behind him.

323
00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.070
Why is he here?

324
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:19.610
He can't be here.

325
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.790
All I can think is he somehow read my vision.

326
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:24.850
Seriously?

327
00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:25.500
Nagi!

328
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.960
Yeah. I'll stop him.

329
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:31.880
But how could he read it so fast? 
How did he predict my move—

330
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:37.010
Did you think I wouldn't 
be able to see what you see?

331
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:43.720
Maybe the goal I smelled earlier 
wasn't a real goal at all.

332
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.940
but I was tricked into thinking it was. 
so that I'd take up that position.

333
00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:54.760
Was I pulled into the future 
of the field that Rin created?

334
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.750
This is the worst!

335
00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:00.990
I wasn't controlling the field! He was!

336
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.950
Bachira! Nagi!

337
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:04.410
Stop him!

338
00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:07.500
We're gonna lose? No way!

339
00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:09.990
No! I...

340
00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:17.420
Right now. I have no way of knowing how big
 the gap is between my skills and Rin's.

341
00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.630
That's how overwhelming and 
despair-inducing the difference is.

342
00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:25.390
So why is it that...

343
00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.530
Even though we were on the brink of losing.

344
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:33.560
my eyes and my heart 
were completely enthralled

345
00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:41.380
by the beautiful arc 
Rin's shot drew in the air.

346
00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:52.000
In the third stage. 
three-on-three Rivalry Battle.

347
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.960
Team Red wins. 5-2.

348
00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.170
Now. who should we pick?

349
00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:58.170
So exciting.

350
00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.380
I don't care. It won't make any difference.

351
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:06.300
Honestly. my brain hadn't 
even caught up at this point.

352
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:10.860
Um. Aryu-kun. I think we should pick him.

353
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.140
What a coincidence. I want him. too.

354
00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.620
I hadn't realized the meaning 
of what we could lose.

355
00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.730
Join us...

356
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:21.560
Bachira Meguru.

357
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:26.820
Y-Your passes are extraordinary.

358
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:31.000
Our team is only good at individual skills. 
so if you join us. we'll be even stronger!

359
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.930
Oh. I got carried away again.

360
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.080
Please don't hate me.

361
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.380
Assist my glam goals.

362
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:41.800
Be my stagehand. Bachira Meguru.

363
00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.060
Enough talking. you two.

364
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.510
Let's get moving.

365
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:48.550
Don't go dozing off. Bob Cut.

366
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.230
Your future is in my hands.

367
00:20:55.750 --> 00:21:01.150
Aw. man. I wanted to be 
on Isagi's team to the end.

368
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:02.660
Bachira.

369
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:06.140
Guess I'll go. That is the rule.

370
00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.960
But I'm not going to wait for you. Isagi.

371
00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.000
If you want me. come and get me.

372
00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:21.320
I'll follow the monster inside me.

373
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:31.930
From here on. I'll have to chase after 
what I've lost to get it back again.

374
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:38.200
In this Blue Lock that's
 jam-packed with egoists.

375
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:44.030
2nd Selection

376
00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:44.030
Nagi Seishiro + Isagi Yoichi\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hLose

377
00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:18.040
Blue Lock. Additional Time.

378
00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:15.250
A

379
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:15.410
Additional Time!

380
00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:15.620
Additional Time!

Additional Time!

383
00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:16.870
Additional Time!

384
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:17.080
Additional Time!

387
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:17.040
Blue Lock

388
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:17.080
Blue Lock

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:17.290

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:18.040
Additional Time!

393
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.420
Form a team of 3 and proceed

394
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.020
The Secret Tale Behind the "Top 3" Team

395
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.020
The Secret Tale Behind the "Top 3" Team

396
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.420
Oh no! What should I do?

397
00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:24.290
To clear this stage. 
I need to be in a team of three?

398
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:28.050
Tokimitsu Aoishi

399
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:28.050
Tokimitsu Aoishi

400
00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:28.050
No one's gonna want to team up with me!

401
00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:29.000
Hm?

402
00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:33.140
Aryu Jyubei

403
00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:33.140
Aryu Jyubei

404
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.140
For a guy who was third to pass 
the first stage. you're not very glam.

405
00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.490
Glam?

406
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:34.470
Glam?!

407
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:34.970
Glam

408
00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:36.090
What's this long-haired
 dude on about?

409
00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.010
Glam

410
00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:40.170
Oh. um. I was just wondering 
who to team up with...

411
00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:38.060
Glam

412
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.300
Glam

413
00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:40.970
Glam

414
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:42.590
The top three will obviously form a team!

415
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.180
Glam

416
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:45.610
It's the glam and noble thing to do.

417
00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.480
Glam

418
00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:49.570
I appreciate the offer. 
but he's definitely a weirdo.

419
00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.860
Glam

420
00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:51.980
I'd rather not team up with him.

421
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.480
Glam

422
00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.440
Glam

423
00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.440
I should politely decline.

424
00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:01.020
Well. the thing is. 
I'm not actually that good.

425
00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.750
I just happened to clear 
that last stage by accident...

426
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.730
Hm? Is that true?

427
00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:07.960
Hey. that's enough already.

428
00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.840
Oh! He's going to step in and help me!

429
00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.510
Itoshi Rin

430
00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.510
Itoshi Rin

431
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.520
Shut up and come here. 
You're wasting my time.

432
00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:18.260
He's way worse!

433
00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.130
N-Nice to meet you.

434
00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:24.290
Being sensible is glam.

435
00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:27.520
Rin + Aryu + Tokimitsu 
teamed up
