1
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.080
They understand one another's weapons. 
and by bringing out each other's abilities.

2
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.910
they've achieved a tri-fusion 
on a higher plane

3
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.180
that even surpasses geniuses 
like Barou and Nagi!

4
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.790
Their team is strong.

5
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.310
Their attack and defense are 
high level and well-balanced.

6
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.980
meaning they have no weaknesses.

7
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.170
And yet. I can't wait to test this new and 
improved version of myself against them.

8
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.130
and find out how well my team's 
new chemical reactions work.

9
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.660
Let's go.

10
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.960
I'm always ready.

11
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.040
Don't order me around.

12
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.000
Episode 17

13
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.000
Donkey

14
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.970
Blind spots and off the ball.

15
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.130
I'm going to fuse these pieces 
with my spatial awareness.

16
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.660
This is my new field vision.

17
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.800
My own team. my opponents... 
I'll take note of where everyone's looking.

18
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.860
I can see each player's movements
 more clearly and precisely than before.

19
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.930
My mind is flooded with images
 and possible routes to goal!

20
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.030
Barou!

21
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.530
Hey. over here. Reo.

22
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.910
He's gonna shift his weight to turn 
and face me. so I'll go the other way!

23
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.710
I dodged past him. 
Now I have a clear run at goal!

24
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.710
Now. Pass it. Barou!

25
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.340
Seriously? He's ignoring me?

26
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.300
The Go-It-Alone King. Even for you...

27
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.760
that was too forced!

28
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.850
Oh. man. I'll take care of Chigiri.

29
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.750
Don't let Reo get the ball!

30
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.560
I know that. but...

31
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.610
This is bad. If we give Kunigami 
the freedom to hit his mid-range shot.

32
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.360
he'll fire it past all of us.

33
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.820
That's in.

34
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.780
Hell yeah!

35
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.340
Nice shot. Kunigami!

36
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.670
Damn. They're crazy strong.

37
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.750
Hey. Barou.

38
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.480
Cut it out already.

39
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.470
Huh?

40
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.010
Isagi was totally free back there.

41
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.760
Why didn't you pass to him?

42
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.210
Shut up.

43
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.470
Why would I pass it to 
someone else so they can score?

44
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.640
Are you dense? It doesn't
 matter if we don't win.

45
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.490
Yeah. off my goals.

46
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.020
You two need to move so I can score.

47
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.060
Stop it. you two!

48
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.510
I'll be the passer for now.

49
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.740
Then. pass it to me next.

50
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.770
No. to me.

51
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.130
Those two can't coordinate.

52
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.180
I have to control this team.

53
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:44.170
I need to re-input the pieces to find
chemical reactions with Nagi and Barou.

54
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.310
I need to update my vision of the field.

55
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.270
I need to lead this team...

56
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.600
toward the goal!

57
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.320
Seriously?

58
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.780
Even if I pass it to Barou.

59
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.330
all routes to goal are stone dead.

60
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.100
As things stand. there can be 
no chemical reaction with Barou.

61
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.960
Then. what are my passing options to Nagi?

62
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.570
The images of potential goals are endless!

63
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.050
Nagi's on the move. 
so he can score if I pass to him.

64
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.260
I've evolved to the level where I can sense 
Nagi's off-the-ball movements.

65
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.710
Let's do this. Nagi.

66
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:34.680
There. right?

67
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.150
That's got some pace on it. 
You trying to compete with me?

68
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.480
Do you know something? 
No matter how fast you are...

69
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.390
humans are unable...

70
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.450
to suddenly go backward.

71
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:49.210
What?

72
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.490
Amazing!

73
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.180
Chigiri came in at top speed. 
but Nagi controlled it the other way.

74
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.080
and created a path to shoot.

75
00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.830
Nagi's play went beyond my vision.

76
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.310
This is...

77
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.890
the chemical reaction 
between Nagi and me!

78
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.850
Nagi 
Seishiro

79
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.850
Isagi 
Yoichi

80
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:09.970
That's one back.

81
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.140
Is he a monster or what?

82
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.430
For real?

83
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.610
He's reached a new level 
since last time. hasn't he?

84
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.420
Nice pass. Isagi.

85
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.050
Let's just play and win with the two of us.

86
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.910
Yeah.

87
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.520
No. wait. We're barely 
holding our own against them.

88
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.020
The missing piece is the 
chemical reaction with Barou.

89
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.840
That'll be the key to winning this game!

90
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.190
Hey. Barou. Listen for a second.

91
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.460
The way things are now. 
I'm not getting that goal smell from you.

92
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.430
Your play needs to allow 
Nagi and me the chance to score.

93
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.810
Only then can we start to make
 the most of each other's play.

94
00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.140
I can't create a chemical reaction alone.

95
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.150
How many times do I have
 to tell you this. you donkey?

96
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.460
I'll win through my goals.

97
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.550
I'd rather die than play for someone else.

98
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.300
Even so...

99
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.060
You passing to me could create
 more options for us. right?

100
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.040
And that might let you score more.

101
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.230
"Might" isn't good enough.

102
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:24.190
"I win how I please."
 All other options get overruled.

103
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.240
And I'm saying we'll lose if we stick to that.

104
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:33.030
Totally fine by me. If I have to change
 my core principle. I'd rather lose.

105
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.520
Why can't you see your way of 
thinking is wrecking your potential?!

106
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.140
You're better than this.

107
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:47.620
I teamed up with you because 
I knew you could be so much more!

108
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.810
At this rate. your career ends here.

109
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:54.150
Hey...

110
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.670
Watch your mouth. donkey.

111
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.730
With my talents. how am I not winning?

112
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.080
The one who's most frustrated with me...

113
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.710
is obviously me. damn it.

114
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.870
To hell with your "chemical reaction."

115
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.770
To hell with "making the 
most of each other's play."

116
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.410
That's the type of soccer you want to play.

117
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:25.270
It makes me wanna puke.

118
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.430
"Do what I tell you."

119
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:34.150
That's all I'm hearing. donkey.

120
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:40.500
Both of us are egoists. after all.

121
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.370
We can only live the way we see fit.

122
00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.880
Don't think for a second 
that you can control me.

123
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.170
Well. you said your piece.

124
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:57.270
Don't get hung up on Barou. 
We can win with just the two of us.

125
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.680
Yeah. You're right.

126
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.720
Damn it. Why am I so hung up on Barou?

127
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.610
To win this game?

128
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:12.070
Or is it because I find Barou's 
irritating situation such a waste?

129
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:16.120
How can I create a 
chemical reaction with Barou?

130
00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.820
But he's got some nerve.

131
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.590
He's still behaving like a king 
when "his way" obviously isn't working.

132
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:24.500
Huh?

133
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.870
If you never admit defeat. 
you'll never know true frustration.

134
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.020
Hey. Isagi Yoichi.

135
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.800
I don't get it.

136
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.270
Why would Nagi choose a guy like you?

137
00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.730
Seriously. what's with this guy?
 He's really annoying.

138
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.940
Who cares? Are you saying you 
have some amazing talent I don't?

139
00:09:54.670 --> 00:10:00.420
I... I don't have any special weapons 
like you. Chigiri. and Kunigami.

140
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:04.700
That's why. in this match. 
I'm only thinking about winning!

141
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.190
That move was immense!

142
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.790
He may not have Chigiri's speed 
or Kunigami's physicality.

143
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.620
but you need more than just 
average skills to stop him.

144
00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:18.680
Isagi Yoichi. I'm going to 
deny you by winning this game.

145
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.190
Let's go. Reo.

146
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.300
Damn it.

147
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.110
Crap. They're ripping us apart.

148
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:29.140
No doubt about it. 
Reo's the core of this team.

149
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.140
He's using Chigiri's weapon on his right 
and Kunigami's weapon on his left

150
00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.510
as a utility player who's 
balancing offense with defense.

151
00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.400
Speed

152
00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.400
Speed

153
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.910
If Chigiri and Kunigami are 
players with specialized skills.

154
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.200
Speed

155
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.200
Speed

156
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:44.520
Reo is a player who excels in every area.

157
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.040
Physical

158
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.040
Physical

159
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.040
Speed

160
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.040

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.040
Power

167
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.750
His flawless. versatile 
style is his essence.

168
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:49.710
Chigiri!

169
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.080
No more getting by me.

170
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.340
Bring it on. Red Guy.

171
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:58.710
Hey now. Don't go lumping 
me in with your selfish king.

172
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:59.550
Huh?

173
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.250
Outrunning people isn't my only skill!

174
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.300
He centered it?

175
00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:05.510
I hafta stop him!

176
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.180
I'll get in front of Reo—

177
00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.020
Outta my way!

178
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:16.910
Yeah!

179
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.980
A perfectly balanced tri-fusion.

180
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.790
They're ridiculously strong!

181
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:30.090
Maybe it's time to give up on Barou?

182
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:35.380
Then. maybe I should start thinking 
how to win with just Nagi and me.

183
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.630
No. that won't work. I'm not getting 
any images of how we can do that.

184
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.300
We'll score one or two. 
but still end up losing.

185
00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.450
Think!

186
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.670
How do we come back and win from here?

187
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.750
You're a genius of adaptability.

188
00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:55.860
Does adaptability mean getting stronger 
to match the strength of the opponent?

189
00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.820
I see. It's not about 
making the most of his play.

190
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.120
I've got to... devour Barou!

191
00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.620
I was wrong.

192
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:25.070
I thought if I tried to fit 
Barou's style. he'd respond.

193
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:27.010
But...

194
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.970
Don't think for a second 
that you can control me.

195
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.510
That's controlling someone 
and expecting them to change.

196
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:38.070
That's not adaptability.

197
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.550
I'm not playing soccer 
to change for someone.

198
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.420
I'm here to win.

199
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.950
It's because you're not afraid to change.

200
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.700
Off the ball

201
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.700
Direct Shot

202
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.700
Spatial
Awareness

203
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.810
I have to change the way
 I use my talent to win.

204
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.200
Off the ball

205
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.200
Direct Shot

206
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.200
Spatial
Awareness

207
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:52.750
Off the ball

208
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:52.750
Direct Shot

209
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:52.750
Spatial
Awareness

210
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.940
Don't rely on Barou. Don't think 
about making the most of his play.

211
00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:03.310
But by devouring his play. 
I will dominate this field!

212
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.640
Nagi. you and I are going to win this.

213
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.600
Oh. you finally caught on?

214
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.820
Just keep your eyes on me.

215
00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.060
Yes. sir.

216
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.320
The score is 1-3.

217
00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.570
We have to score the next goal.

218
00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:29.410
Given how the match has gone so far. 
the other team are wary of Nagi.

219
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.050
Reo is man-marking me to 
stop me from passing to Nagi.

220
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:36.250
Even if one does get through.

221
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.710
they've positioned themselves 
so they can outnumber him.

222
00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.110
Kunigami's marking of
Barou obviously isn't tight.

223
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:46.680
But Kunigami knows that's all 
he needs to do to shut down Barou.

224
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:51.140
Barou's been useless in 
the game up to this point.

225
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:55.050
And that's the shared 
understanding on this field right now.

226
00:13:55.050 --> 00:14:01.060
In fact. the routes to Nagi are getting 
fewer and narrower than before.

227
00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.520
In that case...

228
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:03.980
I'll choose Barou!

229
00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.860
He's dribbling instead of passing?

230
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:05.860
Isagi?

231
00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.860
Good call. donkey.

232
00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.070
Time to move. King.

233
00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:12.280
Beg for a pass from me!

234
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.040
Crap! I won't let you!

235
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.000
That's right. Kunigami.

236
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:18.910
Get dragged away by Barou's charge.

237
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.420
My target is the genius behind him.

238
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.090
It's yours. Nagi!

239
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.340
Seriously?

240
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.690
He got me.

241
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:29.300
This guy...

242
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.880
He dribbled like he was 
going to pass to Barou.

243
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.890
but it was a ruse to divert attention 
away from Nagi and create a path for him.

244
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.850
Nice. Isagi.

245
00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:41.240
Oh no you don't!

246
00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.020
Don't fall for it! 
Nagi will evade you with his takedown!

247
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.930
Rats.

248
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.410
I thought I'd drawn you out.

249
00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.870
Man. close one. That's some honey trap.

250
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.430
Nice work. missy!

251
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:56.830
We'll double up on him!

252
00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:59.690
You're powerless when you're stationary.

253
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:00.780
Pass to me!

254
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.710
Over here. Mr. Hassle Man!

255
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:03.670
Barou.

256
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.460
Like I said. I won't let you!

257
00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.790
Nice. Kunigami!

258
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.420
Chigiri and I will stop Nagi!

259
00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:11.220
Oh.

260
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.330
I see you.

261
00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:16.690
Everyone's focused on what I'm doing.

262
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:19.590
And in the space only I can see...

263
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.690
You were waiting for the right moment
to cut through the darkness...

264
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:25.810
and emerge from the blind spot!

265
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.030
I kept my eyes on you.

266
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.780
Huh?

267
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.780
What?

268
00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.460
Seriously? Was all of this...

269
00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:37.990
Was it all so Isagi could
 get himself in on goal?

270
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.410
So this guy...

271
00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.050
was a decoy!

272
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:48.090
No matter how much you knock on the door 
to someone's heart. you can't change them.

273
00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.970
So it's always you who has to change.

274
00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.650
If you want to change the world
 that isn't following your plan.

275
00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:58.640
that's the only way to make it happen.

276
00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:01.270
If I can't see the light 
that leads to the goal.

277
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.150
then I need to become the light!

278
00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:06.440
Watch me. Barou!

279
00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:08.900
I'm going to adapt to you!

280
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.110
The darkness on the field you created...

281
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.680
I will devour it...

282
00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.400
and turn it into light!

283
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.450
Yeah!

284
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:25.540
This guy used me...

285
00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.980
to score the goal himself!

286
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.570
Damn. Isagi.

287
00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.090
Did he see everything?

288
00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:39.010
This is Isagi Yoichi.

289
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:43.960
The egoist Nagi Seishiro is chasing after.

290
00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.690
Now. time for a comeback.

291
00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:48.820
Yeah.

292
00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:53.870
And Barou. you just keep 
playing the way you are.

293
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.610
Don't drag us down.

294
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:56.360
Huh?

295
00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:00.370
I'm saying don't get in our way...

296
00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:01.510
you donkey.

297
00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:09.710
Who is he calling "donkey"?

298
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.310
I'll kill him.

299
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:14.340
I'm going to prove to you...

300
00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:18.660
that the king on this field is me!

301
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:26.920
His whole aura has changed now.

302
00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.770
What exactly is he seeing?

303
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:34.400
Since I have no idea. 
it'd be risky to go all-in against him.

304
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:40.280
They know that. too. and they're wary of what
 Isagi might do. so they're waiting for a pass.

305
00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.450
I shouldn't be the guy setting this one up.

306
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:44.450
Okay.

307
00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.210
This is the link-up play we practiced.

308
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:49.420
And straight to Kunigami!

309
00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.170
Got it.

310
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.130
If the ball won't come to me. I'll go to the ball!

311
00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:56.660
Seeing you this desperate
 is a rare sight. King.

312
00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.860
This is a physical battle. 
and I'm gonna win it!

313
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.910
Just you watch.

314
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.060
It's my ball!

315
00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:08.580
Pass it. Barou! We can counter!

316
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.310
Screw you! This one's mine!

317
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:14.830
Why don't you listen to the 
common folk every now and then. King?

318
00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:16.530
What he said!

319
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:18.890
I lost it again? Damn it.

320
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:20.780
I'll go again...

321
00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.140
Wait. what's he doing there?

322
00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.890
No way.

323
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:35.340
Did he take up that position knowing
 that would happen when Barou won the ball?

324
00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:39.170
Isagi's evolving at an incredible speed.

325
00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:42.010
I refuse to get left behind!

326
00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.770
A pass? How calm can you get?

327
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.600
Thanks for this.

328
00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.480
Good. We've caught up.

329
00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.280
He's reading all of our moves?

330
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.430
Right now. this field is...

331
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:11.610
...totally being dominated by these guys!

332
00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.360
We'll lose if we don't do something.

333
00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.630
If we just keep relying on our weapons. 
they'll read us and shut us down!

334
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.990
Go. Chigiri!

335
00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:27.310
Like Nagi said. my weakness 
is the moment I control the ball.

336
00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.600
I know how to stop you. miss.

337
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:36.050
No matter how fast I run. 
I slow up when I take down the ball.

338
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:40.400
He's aiming to use that to block my path.

339
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.400
In that case...

340
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.490
it's all or nothing!

341
00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.370
This first touch...

342
00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.910
will propel the ball forward
 without stopping it!

343
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:55.540
It works! I can maintain top speed and let 
the ball run ahead of me at the same pace.

344
00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.750
This is my "no slowing" dribbling!

345
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:02.110
Just try and stop me. Barou.

346
00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:03.930
I'm not like you.

347
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:10.100
I'll draw him into the realm of my 
top speed. That's my new technique!

348
00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.520
Me and my speed...

349
00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.670
You can't dominate us!

350
00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.570
Yeah!

351
00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:30.200
Did he just evolve?

352
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.630
This is awesome.

353
00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:37.210
An egoist who gets buried before us...

354
00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:42.360
can't possibly become the 
world's best striker. right?

355
00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:18.320
A

356
00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:21.110

Blue Lock

Additional Time!

371
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.230
Damn it.

372
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:27.110
Raichi Jingo

373
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:27.110
Raichi Jingo

374
00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:24.090
Another Team of Three

375
00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:24.090
Another Team of Three

376
00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.440
It took me ages to clear that stage.

377
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.110
Who should I team up with?

378
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:28.740
Oh. Raichi.

379
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:36.160
Gagamaru Gin

380
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:36.160
Gagamaru Gin

381
00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.750
No one's here. Seems like 
everyone moved on already.

382
00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:36.160
Glare

383
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:36.160
Like Naruhaya. And Naruhaya.

384
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:39.420
I wouldn't team with him 
anyway. so it's whatever.

385
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:40.460
Glare

386
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.820
So are you the only one left?

387

Glare

388
00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:45.710
I'd love to team up with. like. Nagi or Isagi.

By the way...

395
00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.420
You're so annoying. Big Bro Wanima!

396
00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:52.930
Wanima Junichi

397

Oh. I see.

410

Your little brother 
used to interpret for you.

411
00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.600
Let's try to decipher 
what he's trying to say.

412
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:12.030
Read the facial expression of Wanima (Big bro)!

He's not some tourist from overseas.

428
00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:18.390
I couldn't care less 
about that other traitor.

429
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:20.360
Bet he's complaining about something.

430
00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.880
Wrong!

431
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.730
Hold up!

432
00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:27.090
Flinch

433
00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:27.130
Flinch

Flinch

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.130
He talked normally!

436
00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.300
Listen to me. you two.

437
00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.140
Raichi Jingo!

438
00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.250
First of all. I love how hard
 you are to shake off.

439
00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.820
Not everyone can pull
 that off at this level.

440
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.460
Despite your rough playstyle.
your insight and persistence shine through.

441
00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.860
It's no exaggeration to say your 
qualities are why your team survived.

442
00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:47.480
And Gagamaru Gin!

443
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.080
Your totally unexpected and 
original plays make you a one-of-a-kind.

444
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.570
It might look like you're 
doing stuff randomly.

445
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:58.060
but you pick the optimal choice. backed by
 your flexible yet strong physical abilities.

446
00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.120
and that captured my heart!

447
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.500
I can't help but feel 
we would be a good match!

448
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.750
Therefore. we should team up.

449
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.100
Wow. You think so?

450
00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.110
Hmph. If you insist.

451
00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:12.550
Raichi + Wanima + Gagamaru 
teamed up
