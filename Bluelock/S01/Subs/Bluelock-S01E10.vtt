1
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.570
Yeah!

2
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.740
Huh? What is this?

3
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.740
Wow! We caught up!

4
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.730
Let's keep up this intensity!

5
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.300
What the hell is going on?

6
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.780
They're against Team V.
 the strongest team.

7
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.040
And they only have ten players...

8
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.250
This can't be happening.

9
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.010
Don't tell me they're...

10
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.940
seriously going to win this?

11
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.020
Episode 10

12
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.020
Just the Way It Is

13
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.700
What the hell are you guys doing?! 
Put some effort in. idiots!

14
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.220
Aren't you ashamed that you're 
getting outplayed by ten men?!

15
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.160
Shut up. scumbag.

16
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.460
I'm not one of those "half-in" guys
who lets his dreams go unfulfilled.

17
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.610
Even if I'm on my own. no matter 
the methods I need to rely on.

18
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.630
I'll keep playing soccer
 so I can be the victor.

19
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.480
I won't let them make this 
a comeback win. I can't lose here.

20
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.640
I'm not their toy.

21
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.940
I'm not someone who is satisfied 
with stuff being handed to me.

22
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.160
Until I can prove that I can 
get what I want on my own...

23
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.370
I can't afford to lose!

24
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.540
Are you that terrified of losing?

25
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.000
You sheltered preppy shit!
 You don't know loss?

26
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.550
I'll give you a taste of
 your very first defeat!

27
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.090
This bastard again!

28
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.050
Because of him. my passing options to
 Nagi have become extremely limited.

29
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.100
Breaking through down the 
opposite wing won't be easy.

30
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.180
I want to shake this stalker. but...

31
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.470
Their Number 11's occupying the space.
 waiting to pick up the loose ball.

32
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.030
If I force it. they'll steal the ball.

33
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.360
I can't let them make this 
a comeback win. But how do I...

34
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.980
This field is completely owned by Team Z.

35
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.790
Am I...

36
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.740
Are Nagi and I... losing?

37
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.490
Reo.

38
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.490
Give it to me.

39
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.470
Nagi?

40
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.880
What just happened?

41
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.970
He took the initiative 
for the first time ever?

42
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.730
Reo. I'm gonna give it a try.

43
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.940
Nagi?

44
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.730
What's going on?!

45
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.730
Dribbling's one of his weapons?

46
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.690
A lob?

47
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.830
It was a distraction
 so he could nutmeg me?

48
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.200
Imamura. you're up!

49
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.910
Okay. I'm on it!

50
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.540
A pass out to the wing?!

51
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.540
Damn it! He got a head start!

52
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.760
All right! Let's go!

53
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.850
His move has changed the rhythm of Team V?

54
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.460
Zantetsu. Hit a sick pass into the area.

55
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.090
This is the first time you've 
ever asked me to pass to you.

56
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.900
Nagi. you...

57
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.100
Why am I trying so hard?

58
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.100
Is it because Reo made that face?

59
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:05.780
Stop him!

60
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.120
Because he thinks 
he'll lose for the first time?

61
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.600
Or...

62
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.540
Oh no you don't!

63
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.000
He turned?!

64
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.900
A shot? No. wait. a pass? He's going direct!

65
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.300
Maybe those guys I thought 
were lame actually looked cool?

66
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.840
Jump for it!

67
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.840
Block the shot!

68
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.020
But now that I have it. 
the rest is inevitable.

69
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.800
This curiosity of mine can't be stopped.

70
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.180
No way!

71
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.770
The angle's too tight for a shot!

72
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.480
With soccer...

73
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.540
I want to challenge myself!

74
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.230
We weren't the only ones who awakened 
in this extreme situation.

75
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.980
This monster did. too!

76
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:46.800
Yeah!

77
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.350
Nagi!

78
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.330
Nagi! You...

79
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.580
Hey. Reo...

80
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.790
Soccer's pretty fun.

81
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.580
My life has been a total bore.

82
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:07.100
That is. until I discovered this form of ego
 called "curiosity" just now.

83
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.250
How many more goals do we want?

84
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.610
Yeah!

85
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.080
We can win this!

86
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.510
This is how it should be.

87
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.260
Now I can survive.

88
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.730
This is terrible! We were 
almost on for a comeback win!

89
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.860
I didn't know he could 
 be a playmaker. too.

90
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.090
That goal was huge.

91
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.320
At a time like this...

92
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.750
No. it's because we're in this situation
 that we awakened something.

93
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.300
We stirred the potential that was 
slumbering in the genius. Nagi Seishiro.

94
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.370
We weren't the only ones 
awakening in this extreme situation!

95
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.510
Damn it! We only have 15 minutes left!

96
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.510
What's the plan? How do we stop him?

97
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.390
Kunigami. can you drop back
from the front line and help defend?

98
00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.580
Yeah. If we concede again. we're done.

99
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.770
Maybe we should go defensive
 and rely on countersâ€”

100
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.230
Are you idiots?!

101
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.980
Attack. you scumbags!

102
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.650
Attack. attack. attack. attack!

103
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.620
This donkey and I will 
figure out the midfield.

104
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.810
Raichi...

105
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.160
So attack!

106
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.340
What good will defending do
 at this point. huh?!

107
00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.870
If we don't mount a comeback and win
 in the next 15 minutes. we're done!

108
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.190
Our attacking moves have been working!

109
00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:29.340
We scored three goals against them 
'cause I've been in defense. which I hate!

110
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.440
I'll kill you if you waste my efforts!

111
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.300
Keep attacking until you're dead!
 Go all-out. morons!

112
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.390
You're strikers. aren't you?!

113
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.940
Time Left in the Match:

114
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.940
One more goal. Nagi.

115
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.870
One more goal. and we can win this.

116
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.000
One more goal?

117
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.680
That's all?

118
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.230
He's right.

119
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.370
Attacking is our only option.

120
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.150
I will score!

121
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.710
But for me to reach the goal. 
something's still missing.

122
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:09.130
Right now. the guy who smells most 
like they will score is. without doubt...

123
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:10.590
Nagi!

124
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.570
Now that he's moving freely and on his 
own initiative. how do we stop him?

125
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.220
Bachira? Are you looking 
for someone to pass to?

126
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:20.800
I see.

127
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.190
We've been tearing around a player short.

128
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:29.270
The other team are buoyed by that last goal.
 and Bachira's running on empty.

129
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.740
What do we do?

130
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.240
What can I do?

131
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.700
What can I do to win?

132
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.660
Outrun 'em down the flank. Chigirin.

133
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.870
Yeah. leave it to me.

134
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.080
Bring it. redhead.

135
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.920
I'll stop you this time.

136
00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.540
Redeeming my goner.

137
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.690
You mean "redeeming your
 honor." Stupid Specs!

138
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:50.920
He beats me for acceleration.

139
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.650
But my top speed is faster than his!

140
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.720
I'll outrun him any time. every time!

141
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.100
Good fighting spirit. stupid Zantetsu.

142
00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.060
Seriously? He anticipated that?

143
00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.020
I'll be taking this now. miss.

144
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.770
Not this time. Mr. Genius.

145
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.860
If you wanted it. you should've been here!

146
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.230
Isagi?!

147
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.330
I can't read his moves. but I can 
read the field of play with these eyes.

148
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:20.060
To outrun Zantetsu. 
Chigiri likely had to kick it long.

149
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.860
But until he catches up to his own pass. 
the space it's rolling into is a weak spot.

150
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:30.000
If I run directly into that space. 
this weak spot on the field disappears.

151
00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:34.180
I won't let your feet stop. so keep on running!

152
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.850
Attaboy. Isagi. I'll give you 
a pat on the head later.

153
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:41.810
Damn. he's so fast!

154
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:43.430
Stop him in the penalty area!

155
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:44.060
Okay!

156
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.180
We have enough guys back!

157
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.150
You sure about that? 
Your defense is full of holes.

158
00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.270
The goal is gaping!

159
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.440
Aw. man!

160
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.360
It hit the post?!

161
00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:56.820
It's not over yet.

162
00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.670
Their defense bunched up on 
the left side to deal with Chigiri.

163
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:05.730
but on the opposite wing is the feral boy
 who'll take a shot from anywhere...

164
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.110
Gagamaru!

165
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:10.630
Damn. You bastard.

166
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.340
We still can't get a goal?!

167
00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.780
No. that area there is...

168
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.260
It's his territory!

169
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.230
I'll crush you all.

170
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.050
Attacking in waves!

171
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.050
Attacking in waves!

172
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.540
Just like I envisioned it!

173
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.770
Yeah!

174
00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.820
All right!

175
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.620
Wow. is this really happening?
 It went just how I envisioned.

176
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.390
But how exactly did it come about?

177
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:49.670
The moment Bachira passed to Chigiri. 
a simulation popped into my head.

178
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.730
and the space I ran into
 was the weak spot in it.

179
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:58.990
I knew if I could occupy that space. we could 
keep the ball and unleash a wave of attacks.

180
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.340
That was my inspiration.

181
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.390
Due to my weapon of spatial awareness.
I was able to run a simulation

182
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:11.470
based on all of our weapons. the game 
situation. and the events on the field.

183
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.230
I see. So that's how I use it.

184
00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.990
With these eyes and my brain. 
I can foresee the future of this field!

185
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:24.200
I will use this power to score my goal!

Application to Start a New Club

205
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.380
To: the Principal. Kitsunezaka High School
We would like to request to form a club with the following details:

206
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.380
Great! We now have 11 players!

207
00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.820
Kitsunezaka High School's
soccer team starts here!

208
00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.840
Let's aim to be national champs!

209
00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.050
Yeah!

210
00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:45.890
Hey. Kuon. you're aiming way too high.

211
00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:49.390
Soccer

212
00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:49.390
Team

213
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:49.390
If we're gonna do it. let's aim to go pro
and play for the national team!

214
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:50.600
Move up!

215
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.100
Nice pass. Kuon!

216
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:54.670
Yeah!

217
00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.990
It all started because 
I just wanted to play soccer.

218
00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.900
Right? It's impossible.

219
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.280
He says it every time.

220
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.660
Hey. you're late! Get here 
on time for morning practice!

221
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:07.990
Sorry. my bad.

222
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.210
What was that?! Watch your positioning!

223
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.460
We won't make it to Nationals like this!

224

Kitsunezaka

228
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:18.210
Good effort. guys.

229
00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:19.000
Man. I'm beat!

230
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.420
I'm hungry.

231
00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.340
Aren't you frustrated?!

232
00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.890
We're going to Nationals. right? 
Don't you want to win with this team?!

233
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:28.110
Huh?

234
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.030
Oh boy. he was serious about that.

235
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:31.480
So ambitious.

236
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:34.880
What's wrong with you guys?

237
00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.440
You all agreed that we'd go to Nationals
 and play for the national team...

238
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.300
We were just playing along.

239
00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.400
You're the only one who 
seriously thought we could make it.

240
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:49.140
I mean. a weak school like us going to 
Nationals? You watch too much anime.

241
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:53.580
We made it to the regional quarter-finals.
 Isn't that enough?

242
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:54.830
Let's go do karaoke!

243
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.140
Sounds good.

244
00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:58.750
Kuon. you're overbearing.

245
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.820
Playing soccer with you isn't fun.

246
00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:03.940
Hurry up.

247
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.570
I don't need all this extra stuff.

248
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.140
My bad. let's go.

249
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:11.390
In the end. I was the only one 
playing soccer seriously.

250
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.250
I don't care.

251
00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:19.850
I don't need friends anymore.

252
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.570
Kuon Wataru-sama

253
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.570
You have been selected

254
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.570
to become a certified athlete

255
00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:26.420
At least someone acknowledges my efforts.

256
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:30.310
That's the place I should be.

257
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:34.850
Even if I have to go it alone!

258
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.580
Despite only being a team of ten.

259
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:51.600
Team Z has maximized their weapons 
and taken control of midfield.

260
00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.470
Team V's attacks. on the other hand.

261
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.830
are unpredictable. due to 
Nagi Seishiro's awakening.

262
00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.020
Both teams have a chance of winning.

263
00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.590
The next goal will decide the match.

264
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:04.730
But...

265
00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.450
If it ends in a draw.

266
00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:10.660
Team

267
00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:10.660
Team

268
00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:10.660

269
00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:10.660
Points

270
00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:10.660

271
00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:10.660
Points

272
00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:10.660
Goal
Difference

273
00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:10.660

274
00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:10.660
Goal
Difference

275
00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.660
Team Z will finish third
and flunk the first selection.

276
00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:15.950
In which case. the team's top scorer 
advances to the second selection.

277
00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:19.540
I've scored three goals so far. But...

278
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.420
With that goal just now. 
Kunigami's also scored three.

279
00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.370
And our fair play points are both zero. too.

280
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:32.530
So the highest-ranked player on the 
Blue Lock ranking chart will advance.

Kuon Wataru

294
00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.560
Which means I go through!

295
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.770
So things need to stay as they are.

296
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:42.790
If I don't do anything. I can survive.

297
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.160
Stay just the way it is.

298
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:51.370
I don't need to do a damn thing.

299
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.870
Go Zantetsu. Counter.

300
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:57.540
I'm gonna stop you!

301
00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.620
Too bad. Little Miss Redhead.

302
00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.080
Right now. we have...

303
00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.040
A long-ball counter?!

304
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.250
...a genius who's just awakened!

305
00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:05.960
It's to Nagi!

306
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.050
Get back! Now!

307
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.770
If they score one more goal. we're done!

308
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.960
Nice. Zantetsu. Good eyes.

309
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.210
It's here. right?

310
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.770
The weakest of weak spots
 on the field right now.

311
00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.410
You won't escape me!

312
00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.480
We meet often.

313
00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.690
Nice. Isagi. Stop him!

314
00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:27.150
If he shakes you. 
he's one-on-one with the goalie!

315
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:32.200
No. He'll probably beat me to where it drops.

316
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:36.930
Even if I go to block him off. 
he might evade me with his control.

317
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:41.370
So what I need to do is keep 
my distance and circle around.

318
00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.830
so my teammates have time
 to get back into our half!

319
00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:47.610
I made it!

320
00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:48.920
His first touch is key!

321
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.130
Right foot? Or left?

322
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:52.650
Bring it.

323
00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:53.840
I'll stop you!

324
00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.280
Eh? Huh?

325
00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.530
Off his back?

326
00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.730
He's so outside the box!

327
00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.500
He passed me in an instant.

328
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.490
This is bad.

329
00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:07.110
Real bad!

330
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:12.070
I'm not one of those "half-in" guys
who lets his dreams go unfulfilled.

331
00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:17.530
It's over. We're gonna lose to 
 that monster's inspiration!

332
00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:24.040
Even if I'm on my own. no matter 
the methods I need to rely on...

333
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.500
Stop him!

334
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:31.010
Stop him!

335
00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:39.910
Everything's... getting destroyed...

336
00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.240
Foul by Team Z.

337
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.260
Denial of an obvious
 goal-scoring opportunity.

338
00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.570
Red card to Kuon Wataru.

339
00:16:58.570 --> 00:16:59.530
He's off.

340
00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:02.360
Kuon. what are you doing?

341
00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.970
Ah. damn.

342
00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.790
Now you guys can keep on fighting.

343
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.000
Are you okay. Nagi?!

344
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.590
What did you do. you bastard!

345
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.130
Stop him!

346
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:11.980
What the heck was that?!

347
00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.920
Reo. I'm fine.

348
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:14.540
But...

349
00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:15.830
Calm down. Reo!

350
00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:19.170
Another yellow card and you're off. too.

351
00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.300
You bastards.

352
00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.560
What the heck kind of plan is this?

353
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.030
Don't ask me. I'm wondering
 the same thing.

354
00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.020
Hey. Kuon.

355
00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.730
You could've survived if you hadn't
 gotten involved. What's the deal?

356
00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:36.700
Oh. I just... I did it for myself.

357
00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:39.160
Kuon.

358
00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.890
But you've scored three. same as Kunigami.

359
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:48.170
Wait. so because of that red card. 
his fair play score is lower than Kunigami.

360
00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:54.550
So does that mean. if we tie this game. 
Kuon-chan's done. just like the rest of us?

361
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:57.380
Shut up.

362
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.550
I knew that.

363
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.170
I knew. but...

364
00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.310
Listen up. jerks.

365
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:07.380
You need to win.

366
00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.060
I'm going to be the 
best striker in the world.

367
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:16.240
You shut your mouth. Kuon. 
That goes without saying.

368
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.950
We're gonna win this!

369
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:20.910
I'll become the best in the world.

370
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.180
No. it'll be me!

371
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.630
I won't let it end here!

372
00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.870
Nagi. are you hurt?

373
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:30.680
No. I'm okay.

374
00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.210
Three more minutes.

375
00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.900
Hey. Reo. How do you want us to defend?

376
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.670
Let's pass it about and run down the clock.

377
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.810
Huh? What are you talking about?

378
00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:38.570
Huh?

379
00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.600
Our only option is to crush them.

380
00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:46.790
A draw against a team like this 
is pretty much the same as losing.

381
00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:49.330
One more goal. One more goal.

382
00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.910
We can't let it end here. either.

383
00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:03.650
A free kick 20 meters out 
and slightly to the goalie's right.

384
00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:08.910
If we concede now with so little time left.
 our chance of winning goes up in smoke.

385
00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:08.910
No giving away a foul. you hear?!

386
00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.410
Protect the goal with your life!

387
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:15.470
We all feel the gravity of the situation.
but this was made possible by Kuon.

388
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:20.530
Our time should be up. 
but we have a few seconds left.

389
00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:22.690
We have to make it count!

390
00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:24.480
We have to stop them. no matter what!

391
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.900
Think!

392
00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:31.260
If I were Reo. would I pass to Nagi. who does
 crazy shit no matter how tight we mark him?

393
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.170
Or would I feint and 
hit it to Zantetsu instead?

394
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.780
Which one? Who would I pass to?

395
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.320
No. this is Blue Lock!

396
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:45.510
Seriously?!

397
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:46.750
He didn't pass?

398
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.750
If he's an egoist. 
he'll take on the shot himself!

399
00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.210
There!

400
00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.370
Get the loose ball!

401
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.370
Nice. Iemon!

402
00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.550
Crap! He's fast!

403
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.360
Where the heck did you come from?!

404
00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.390
From the wall.

405
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:05.470
Get the ball!

406
00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.340
If I can just get it firstâ€”

407
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.390
One more goal.

408
00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:14.940
S-Stop him!

409
00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:28.660
Not done yet!

410
00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.290
They held out?

411
00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.380
Are you serious? What the heck is going on?

412
00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.250
This is Team V. the strongest team.

413
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.330
And those guys are down to ten men.

414
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:48.920
They might actually do this.

415
00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:55.300
Go. Isagi!

416
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.970
This is our last chance.

417
00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:30.210
A

418
00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:32.260
Blue Lock. Additional Time.

419
00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:30.370
Additional Time!

420
00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:30.580
Additional Time!

421
00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:30.790
Additional Time!

422
00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:31.000
Additional Time!

423
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.830
Additional Time!

424
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:32.040
Additional Time!

425
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:31.920
Blue Lock

426
00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:31.960
Blue Lock

427
00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.000
Blue Lock

428
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:32.040
Blue Lock

429
00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:32.250
Blue Lock

430
00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:32.250
Additional Time!

431
00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:33.000
Blue Lock

432
00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:33.000
Additional Time!

433
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.980
Team Z Impersonation Championship No.\h\h2

434
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.980
Team Z Impersonation Championship No.\h\h2

435
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:38.960
Gagamaru Gin

436
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:38.960
Gagamaru Gin

437
00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:38.960
"On the field. I am the king. you donkey."

438
00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.610
That was terrible!

439
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.250
Kunigami 
Rensuke

440
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.250
Kunigami 
Rensuke

441
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.350
Are you supposed to be Barou?!

442
00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:46.460
Isagi 
Yoichi

443
00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:46.460
Isagi 
Yoichi

444
00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.370
Whoever you try to be. you're always you.

445
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:51.260
Okay! Isagi's up next in the 
"Who Am I?" championship!

446
00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.260
Naruhaya
Asahi

447
00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.260
Naruhaya
Asahi

448
00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:56.170
"Huh. natto. Must be nice. 
All I've been getting is pickled radish."

449
00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:57.340
Igaguri!

450
00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.930
Correct! Amen! Amen!

451
00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:02.580
All right! I'll do the last one.

452
00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.450
Okay. Let's hear it. hero.

453
00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.400
Yeah! Wrap it up with a bang!

454
00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.590
Uh. who's that?

455
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.840
It's Niko after he lost to us.

456
00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.670
What kind of choice is that?

457
00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:17.790
So cute!

458
00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:19.380
Adorbs.

459
00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:20.980
I can't even.
