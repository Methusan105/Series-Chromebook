1
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.620
C'mon. guys. Stop fighting over a silly bed.

2
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.870
We're teammates now. so—

3
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.060
Quit it!

4
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.830
See? You're kicking up dust!

5
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.090
You...

6
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.010
Ventilate the room.

7
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.260
And don't leave your towels and 
clothes on the floor. They're eyesores.

8
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.700
Uh. right.

9
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.260
Isn't Barou kinda meticulous?

10
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.310
You're not a king anymore.

11
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.900
You're a maid.

12
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.940
It's the birth of Maid Barou.

13
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.680
You and I don't get along. Mr. Hassle Man.

14
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.450
Huh? That nickname sucks. I don't like it.

15
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.910
Move. Mr. Hassle Man.

16
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.760
Don't call me that. It'll upset my folks.

17
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.160
I see.

18
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.500
He has some absolute rules
 that must not be broken.

19
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.710
Oh. and I go to bed at 10pm sharp. 
so no turning on the light after that.

20
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.710
It's like everything has to be 
just right or he won't be satisfied.

21
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.380
He has a clear idea of 
how he wants to lead his life.

22
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.210
What a hassle. I'm gonna play my game.

23
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.220
Yeah. having Barou around might be a hassle.

24
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.510
but maybe his whole "I am the rule" shtick
 is the driving force behind his ego

25
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.270
that makes his 
exceptional skills possible.

26
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.680
I want to learn more about him. 
so I can understand his genius.

27
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.530
Hey. wanna come train with me?

28
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.180
Unless we understand each other. 
there won't be any chemical reactions.

29
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.040
Episode 16

30
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.040
Tri-Fusion

31
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.380
I'm fine with practicing. 
but why's it just the two of us?

32
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.590
What's he doing?

33
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.150
Apparently. that's his daily
 physical training routine.

34
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.270
Isn't it a bit long? 
Not to mention. seriously intense.

35
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.980
How long you gonna keep that
 up for. Barou? Come join us.

36
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.650
Forty more minutes. 
Then I'll grace you with my presence.

37
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.980
Did that guy lose his sense of 
cooperation while still in the womb?

38
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.000
I can watch an episode of 
a TV drama in forty minutes.

39
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.280
Yeah. or nearly two episodes of anime.

40
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.250
But I guess this strict regime and 
his self-discipline are why he's so strong.

41
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.010
Right. It's almost an obsession.

42
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.680
Well. in that case...

43
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.430
I'll join you!

44
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.540
Huh? Forget it. donkey.

45
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.310
You can't possibly keep up.

46
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.420
You never know until you try!

47
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.770
Uh. what's happening?

48
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.990
Jeez...

49
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.770
I'll join you. too!

50
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.490
To advance further...

51
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.030
To beat those guys...

52
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.420
I'll trigger a chemical reaction
 with all three of us.

53
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.090
So. um. as you can see.
 in the second selection.

54
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.300
interpersonal relations. self-awareness.
 and understanding others all improve.

55
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.300
Japan Football Union
BL Supervisor

56
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.890
and each player has to think for 
themselves to get their team playing.

57
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:53.550
This is how they are able to grow into 
independent strikers without compare.

58
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.110
That concludes my report.

59
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.440
You've presented all sorts
 of plausible arguments.

60
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.010
but it really all comes 
down to talent. right?

61
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.570
Japan Football Union
Special Adviser

62
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.570
Even left to his own devices. 
a genius is still a genius.

63
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.530
He's right.

64
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.950
What we want is Japan's next star player.

65
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.250
Hurry up and produce a genius 
high school player who'll make a splash.

66
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.960
Well. we're only at the 
second selection. and—

67
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.500
You want a star that badly?

68
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.920
You old geezers truly are money grabbers.

69
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.520
How many geniuses have been 
crushed underfoot that way?

70
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.340
Blue Lock Project
Representative

71
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.600
What do you mean. Ego-kun?

72
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.080
All you ever do is create 
a temporary genius.

73
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:41.270
Then the stupid bandwagon fans go crazy
 about this domestic-level "genius"

74
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.190
and spend tons of money
 on shirts and tickets.

75
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.360
This deluded "genius" goes off to 
play overseas totally unprepared.

76
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.440
but two or three years later. he's back.

77
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.430
because he can't produce results
 due to "cultural and language barriers."

78
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.920
Domestic Transfer

79
00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.380
and he spends the rest of his days as a 
mid-level player in the domestic league.

80
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:07.220
If you don't break this cycle. 
Japanese soccer will forever be third-rate.

81
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.140
Producing the best striker in the
 world will remain a pipe dream.

82
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:16.100
W-We have operation costs to think about! 
Making money is necessary to some extent!

83
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.230
Then. let me ask you this:

84
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.270
What is talent?

85
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.110
Is it a natural gift you're born with?

86
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.740
Or is it being blessed 
with a splendid physique?

87
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.860
To me. those things make you 
nothing but a diamond in the rough.

88
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:38.270
Make a note. Talent is the skill 
to prove one's own ability.

89
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.900
Someone who dreams of demonstrating the 
ability he believes in to the rest of the world.

90
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.110
and dedicates his life to it...

91
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.820
That's what I call a genius.

92
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.410
I'm creating a genius in Blue Lock.

93
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.010
And I'm dedicating my life
 to demonstrating it.

94
00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.980
Okay. then! I look forward to 
seeing the results. Ego-kun.

95
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.590
Failure is not an option.

96
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.070
Oh.

97
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.180
This guy...

98
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.780
We told him over and over.
 but he still took the single bed!

99
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.300
I said we'd rock. paper. scissors for it.

100
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.480
Hey. can I go kick him awake?

101
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.190
But it looks like the room is tidier.

102
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.540
Maybe Maid Barou cleaned up the place?

103
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:30.170
I guess it's fine. then. Thinking about it is 
too much of a hassle. so I'm going to bed.

104
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.180
Huh? It's fine?

105
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.210
Man. you're so laid-back.

106
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:35.590
Huh?

107
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.530
Wait. I'm on the bottom bunk?

108
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.250
Geniuses really are selfish!

109
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:42.770
Reo!

110
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.100
Okay!

111
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.060
Run. Chigiri!

112
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:46.770
Piece of cake.

113
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.030
That was pretty good.

114
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.150
Our coordination's getting better.

115
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:56.990
Nice shot. missy.

116
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.400
Isagi and the others must 
have advanced already. right?

117
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.580
If we don't get a move on.
 they might clear all the stages.

118
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:10.270
I realize that. but if we just play whoever.
 we'll get someone mediocre.

119
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:14.620
Losing to Isagi because we didn't improve
 would be getting our priorities wrong.

120
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:19.670
But doesn't it look like the strong guys
 are already winning and advancing?

121
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:21.880
That's true.

122
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.140
What do you think. Reo?

123
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.920
As long as we can beat Nagi. I don't care.

124
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.070
I'm gonna make him say he needs me.

125
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.690
Is that a regret?

126
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.070
No. it's revenge.

127
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.300
So intense. I like it.

128
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.410
You are a genius of adaptability!

129
00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:52.630
That's what Naruhaya said.
 but what exactly is "adaptability"?

130
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:58.510
I won because I was able to emulate
Naruhaya's weapon of getting in behind.

131
00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:04.090
Does adaptability mean getting stronger 
to match the strength of the opponent?

132
00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:10.760
Then. my next target 
should be this selfish king.

133
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.810
Can I sit here?

134
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.480
Hm? Knock yourself out.

135
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.050
Say. Barou. what's your ideal playstyle?

136
00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.370
What kind of question is that? 
And what's it to you?

137
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.540
I want to create a 
chemical reaction with you.

138
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:27.670
And for that. I think we need to
know each other's ideal playstyle.

139
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.670
So tell me about the kind 
of soccer you wanna play.

140
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.710
Help me so I can score.

141
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.180
That's it. The end.

142
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.250
Well. sure. but...

143
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.660
That's why you lost to us. remember?

144
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.620
Could we consider. like. 
coordinating as teammates or...

145
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.630
Huh? What do you mean?

146
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.820
I would've won if that shorty 
had done what I needed him to.

147
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.510
You still lost.

148
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:57.280
You may score goals by yourself. 
but that alone won't make your team win.

149
00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.480
Who cares?

150
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.250
"Win through my goals."

151
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.990
I'm not changing my rule.

152
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:07.030
I mean. if you were looking
to win by using team play.

153
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:11.420
why didn't you pick that
 shorty instead. donkey?

154
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.750
You're not getting it!

155
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.510
Sure. Naruhaya and I 
could've understood each other.

156
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:23.600
Off the ball

157
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:23.600
Off the ball

158
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.430
but a chemical reaction 
would've been beyond us.

159
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:23.600
Blind spot

160
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:23.600
Blind spot

161
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.730
I emulated his weapon. so I know.

162
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.140
A weapon I can emulate won't cut it.

163
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:27.800
A shot range that's over 28 meters. 
A bulldozing charge.

164
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:32.580
You have weapons I could never obtain.
even if I spent the rest of my life trying.

165
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:37.150
With me. your talents can shine brighter.

166
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.940
Then. all the more reason 
for you to do as I say.

167
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:46.420
Wait. that's... Then what's 
the point of being a team?

168
00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.080
Hey!

169
00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.690
Shut up. I'm taking a bath.

170
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.390
Aw. gimme a break. What's up with that guy?

171
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.740
He's a king through and through.

172
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.060
I'm sure he doesn't have a lot of friends.
 In fact. I bet he has none!

173
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.340
Man...

174
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.230
He does have talent. though.

175
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.900
But he won't win since he has 
no sense of cooperation.

176
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.270
It's like Barou...

177
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:13.080
is a seriously wasteful genius.

178
00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:19.110
Man. my muscles are so sore.

179
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:23.250
Oh. it's because I did 
Barou's intense training regimen.

180
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.200
I can't believe he does that every day.

181
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:27.540
Oh. my bad.

182
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.230
Didn't mean to splash you.

183
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.950
Kunigami?

184
00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:32.480
Isagi?

185
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.770
I didn't know you were here.

186
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.020
No. wait. That's my line.

187
00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.650
Why are you still at the third stage?

188
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:47.130
So long story short. you lost to Itoshi Rin's
 team and lost Bachira as a result.

189
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:53.020
then you stole Barou. condemning Naruhaya.
 and now. you're here. Is that about right?

190
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.830
Yup. more or less.

191
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.000
I don't see you for a while
 and you go through all that.

192
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.780
Who'd you team up with?

193
00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.680
With me. loser.

194
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.000
What were you thinking. 
leaving us behind? Stupid Isagi.

195
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.120
Chigiri!

196
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.100
Why didn't you wait for me. you jerk?

197
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:13.920
What he said.

198
00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:19.140
I-I'm sorry. I was gonna wait. 
but then Nagi asked me—

199
00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.380
You talking about me?

200
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:25.090
What are you doing?

201
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:29.180
Huh? This is the easiest way to take a bath.

202
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.060
Well. if Nagi asked me. I'd probably go. too.

203
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.770
Yeah. same here.

204
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:37.850
Hey. Mr. Hassle Man.

205
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:43.320
You louse. Don't swim in the public bath.

206
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.820
Ah. a little swim won't hurt.

207
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.080
Look. I'm a ninja.

208
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.160
Stop blowing bubbles! 
You're getting your spit everywhere!

209
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.250
Did you all wash before getting in?

210
00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.390
Yup.

211
00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.450
I used conditioner. too.

212
00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.800
And don't put the towel 
in the hot water. It's dirty!

213
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.350
Hey. Isagi. is Barou
really this persnickety?

214
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.700
Yeah. He's super particular about things.

215
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.520
I'm getting dizzy. Can I have some water?

216
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.640
So? Do you know who you're playing next?

217
00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.640
Out! It's because you swam. idiot!

218
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.930
No. not yet. What about you?

219
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:13.730
We're...

220
00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.220
We're playing you. obviously.

221
00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.690
That's why I teamed up with them. you know.

222
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:22.650
Reo.

223
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:23.740
It's been a while.

224
00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:27.530
Hey. listen. Reo. 
I trained so much after that...

225
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:29.620
Stop.

226
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.750
You and I are enemies now. Nagi.

227
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:38.730
You didn't choose me. 
so I'm going to crush you.

228
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.880
So I guess I should ask...

229
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.130
Do you want to play us?

230
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.300
Don't you run away.

231
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:50.140
Sure.

232
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.010
With pleasure.

233
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:58.030
Time Until the Match:

234
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.070
Let's pass it around so 
it's easy for Barou to move.

235
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:13.030
and if the situation allows. Nagi and I will 
break them down with our link-up play.

236
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.660
and we can be flexible with the finish.

237
00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:18.120
Okay. So I guess I'm gonna
 be scoring a lot. then.

238
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.290
Hey. make sure you pass me the ball.

239
00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.990
No. After all. you won't pass to me.

240
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.250
Even so. pass it to me.

241
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.010
No way.

242
00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:25.860
Do it.

243
00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:26.500
I said no.

244
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.220
Yup. these two are gonna find it 
impossible to coexist on the field.

245
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:32.320
Guess it's up to me to be the key man

246
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.680
by adjusting to these two and 
triggering a chemical reaction.

247
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.210
But Isagi. why'd you let them provoke you
 into answering them immediately?

248
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:43.610
We could've looked for 
some other team to play.

249
00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:48.030
Oh. well. I didn't want them 
to underestimate us. I guess.

250
00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.870
Our weapons are Nagi's first touch. 
Barou's dribbling. and my direct shot.

251
00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.870
In order for us to beat Rin's "Top 3" team.

252
00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:01.250
we're definitely lacking in a certain area.

253
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:02.450
And that area is?

254
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.090
The speedster. Chigiri Hyoma.

255
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:08.170
I want his speed.

256
00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:09.670
I see.

257
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:13.850
Wait. We need someone who's good at 
hold-up play so they can pass me the ball.

258
00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.310
That orange-haired guy's physique...

259
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:19.140
I want someone like him 
who's good at ball retention.

260
00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:24.100
True. if we had Kunigami. 
the ball would stay up front more.

261
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.980
And he has a mid-range shot as a weapon. too.

262
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.320
I guess I'd have to choose Reo.

263
00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.780
I did promise him we'd play together again.

264
00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.690
Uh. wait. so we all want different people?

265
00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:39.940
I have a style of soccer I want to play.

266
00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:43.630
I guess we don't have to decide right now.

267
00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:47.090
If we don't win. they'll take one of us.

268
00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:53.510
Okay. let's go over formations again.

269
00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.890
Kunigami

270
00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.890
Chigiri

271
00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.890
Reo

272
00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.890
So like this. Reo is the anchor
 who provides balance.

273
00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:06.480
And Chigiri and I will 
attack down both sides.

274
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.780
Okay. We worked on combinations
 in our training session.

275
00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.490
so in terms of attacking might. 
we should be equal.

276
00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:16.850
Right. So onto the question 
of who's marking who.

277
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.080
I will mark Isagi Yoichi.

278
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.580
I want to play soccer with him.

279
00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:28.670
I will put him in my pocket and prove
 to Nagi that he made the wrong choice.

280
00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:35.340
Okay. Then. given our respective
 physiques. I'll mark Barou.

281
00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.390
Then. I've got Nagi.

282
00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.610
Also. who are we gonna pick?

283
00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:40.810
Hm...

284
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.270
Isagi's weapon would be great 
if we can make it fit our team.

285
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.730
and Barou's individual
skills are appealing.

286
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.090
but going purely on attributes. I'd say Nagi.

287
00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:50.410
I agree.

288
00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:52.890
He's at that level without 
even trying. right?

289
00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:56.010
Just from a potential point of view.
 Nagi's the only choice.

290
00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:57.570
Don't you think. Reo?

291
00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:04.290
No. it might be better to kick him out.
 so he can go through what I did.

292
00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.650
Hey now. don't involve
 your personal feelings.

293
00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:09.880
This team is more than just you.

294
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.940
Well. maybe we should 
take a vote after the match?

295
00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.800
We'll find out the answer 
we need in the match. anyway.

296
00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:23.900
4th Stage

297
00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:23.890
Hey. you guys.

298
00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.900
Cafeteria

299
00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:27.060
Want to play my team?

300
00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.940
W-We'd like a match with you. 
What do you say?

301
00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.970
Uh. but you have the top three on your team.

302
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.400
No. thanks.

303
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.570
Come on. let's go.

304
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.240
H-Hey. wait up!

305
00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:42.490
How many rejections does that make now? 
They all get scared and run away.

306
00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:46.370
Aw. man. What do we do?

307
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.750
No one's gonna play us.

308
00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.840
New BL Ranking

309
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.840
What if we run out of time?

310
00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:55.110
Beating players that run away 
at this stage wouldn't be glam.

311
00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:57.600
New BL Ranking

312
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:57.590
They'll eventually get disqualified.

313
00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:00.020
I don't want to play yet. anyway.

314
00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:03.060

315
00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.060
I'm planning on waiting for Isagi's team.

316
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.350
But. but. but!

317
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.100
What if they don't make it here?

318
00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.690
We're finished!

319
00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:11.620
Don't worry. Isagi will get here.

320
00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.860
I can't lose anymore.

321
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.320
Let's go. Isagi.

322
00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.230
Yeah!

323
00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:23.010
If I want Bachira back.
 then I can't get stuck here!

324
00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.710
Nice shot. Rin-chan.

325
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:31.290
Can I join you?

326
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:34.190
Hm? You're in my way. Leave.

327

New BL Ranking

328
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:38.100
You said you were playing soccer 
to surpass your big brother. right?

329
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.160
So what?

330
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.330
I told you to leave.

331
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:45.900
I've never seen anyone look 
as blue as you while playing soccer.

332
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.390
Are you picking a fight with me. Bob Cut?

333
00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:53.580
Play with me. 
and I promise you'll have fun.

334
00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:57.190
Hey.

335
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.990
Hm?

336
00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:03.490
I wonder if a hero gets this excited
 when they're fighting bad guys.

337
00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:06.950
You're excited because you've 
teamed up with me. you dumb hero.

338
00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:09.890
We'll win this. Chigiri.

339
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:11.370
We sure will. Kunigami.

340
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.500
I'll outrun everyone.

344
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:29.860
Somehow. I'm not scared.

345
00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.370
Is it because I'm shoulder 
to shoulder with geniuses?

346
00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.440
Or might it be because
 I've gotten stronger?

347
00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.820
The answer to that...

348
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.490
will be revealed by winning this game!

349
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:48.290
Go. Barou!

350
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:52.250
Our chemical reaction with you will 
be the key to controlling this game!

351
00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:53.910
Hey. King.

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:02.180
That weak press won't stop me.

357
00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.510
What's the matter? 
Too scared to get close?

358
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.720
Come at me if you want.

359
00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:12.690
What's with this defense?

360
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:15.900
Getting in close. then pulling back... 
What's he up to?

361
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.990
Off you go. You're free 
to roam in that direction.

362
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.820
Huh?

363
00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.900
It's impossible to stop you
 one hundred percent of the time.

364
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.300
I get it now!

365
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.090
He's letting him go if he 
dribbles away from goal.

366
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.870
Stop

367
00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:28.790
Let go

368
00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:31.750
and saving his physicality for stopping 
him from getting into range for his shot.

369
00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.580
Stop

370
00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.580
Let go

371
00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:29.790
Let go

Stop

373
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.580
Stop

374
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.580
Let go

375
00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:30.580
Let go

376
00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:30.580
Stop

377
00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:31.750
Stop

Let go

383
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:35.960
It's a Barou-exclusive man-marking 
that utilizes Kunigami's physique!

384
00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.170
Though I'm barely able to stop you.
 even with this tactic.

385
00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:42.590
A meathead soldier boy like you
 is trying to outsmart me?

386
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:44.380
Pass it to me. Barou! Over here!

387
00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.670
Shut up and stop ruining it. donkey.

388
00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:48.770
I can outrun a guy like him myself!

389
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.250
Man. how selfish can you get?

390
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.390
Isagi. what do we do?

391
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:55.090
Don't drop back! Stay in their half!

392
00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.380
I'll back up Barou and 
keep us going forward—

393
00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.540
What did you say you were going to do?

394
00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.570
Prepare yourself. Isagi Yoichi.

395
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.530
Nagi's a treasure I found.

396
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:08.900
I'll take him back from you in this game!

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.910
Barou. pass to me! Now!

401
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.400
Shut up! Don't distract me!

402
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.010
Use me. Barou!

403
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.790
But you won't. King.

404
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:21.130
Don't think you can beat us alone!

405
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:22.460
Took your time. Reo.

406
00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:24.190
Good work. Meat Wall.

407
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.260
Tch. Damn it!

408
00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.100
See? Told you.

409
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:29.990
Let's go. Kunigami!

410
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:31.140
I'm going!

411
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.040
Are these guys for real?

412
00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.810
Knowing Barou wouldn't pass.
 they doubled up on him.

413
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:38.200
And they switched up
 the play seriously fast!

414
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.860
It's now me versus Reo and Kunigami. 
meaning I'm outnumbered.

415
00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.420
I'm the last line of defense.
 I have to stop them.

416
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.420
Is he going to dribble all the way
 or pass to Kunigami?

417
00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.530
Which is it?

418
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.110
Wait till the last second.

419
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.750
Keep your distance to 
react to either eventuality.

420
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.580
Read the timing when 
Reo makes his decision!

421
00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:00.420
A pass to Kunigami!

422
00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:01.840
If I can intercept...

423
00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:04.630
Huh?

424
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:06.080
He passed it to...

425
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:09.900
Chigiri!

426
00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.220

427
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:11.760
Right on the money. Reo.

428
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:16.020
You were bound to slow up
when taking the ball down.

429
00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.580
I caught up to you. Red Panther.

Sure. For a moment.

432
00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.730
Happy with yourself. genius? Well...

433
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:27.450
Now you get to step on my shadow!

434
00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:35.580
Seriously? This is my first one-on-one 
against him. but he's annoyingly fast.

435
00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:39.040
Our formation has been ripped apart!

436
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:44.670
Kunigami's physique. 
Reo's tactics. and Chigiri's speed...

437
00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:49.180
They understand one another's weapons. 
and by bringing out each other's abilities.

438
00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.260
they've achieved a 
tri-fusion on a higher plane

439
00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.970
that even surpasses 
geniuses like Barou and Nagi!

440
00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:00.690
Yeah!

441
00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:01.900
Eat it!

442
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:03.730
Damn.

443
00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:05.940
They're a great team.

444
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.320
Now I'm definitely fired up.

445
00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.590
Now I'm definitely crushing them!
