1
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.200
So...

2
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.900
Who do you wanna pick?

3
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.660
For me. it's gotta be Number 50. Kunigami.

4
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.710
He can hold up the ball
in and around the box.

5
00:00:26.711 --> 00:00:30.090
and if he joins our team.
we'll spend more time with it up front.

6
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:33.130
That way. I can score more goals.

7
00:00:33.131 --> 00:00:39.110
No. Reo in an anchor role can do that better
while also balancing our attack and defense.

8
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.850
If we wanna play however
we want. he's our best bet.

9
00:00:42.851 --> 00:00:45.420
Hm. I guess that works. too.

10
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:46.440
Right?

11
00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:49.620
True. that'd bring the
team together nicely.

12
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:54.320
But it's also a suicidal act that
would crush all of our potentials.

13
00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:55.570
What?

14
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.570
Huh?

15
00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.900
The correct choice right now is to create
a balanced team. But that's not our way.

16
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.790
Remember. chemical reactions are
the key to clearing the second selection.

17
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.950
We're here now because we were
able to create some in real time.

18
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.460
I devoured Barou.
and Barou devoured me right back.

19
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.390
None of us could've
foreseen a play like that.

20
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.390
That unpredictability is
the essence of our play.

21
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.790
I want someone who can devour us.

22
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.390
Otherwise. we won't be able to beat them<i>.</i>

23
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.740
Well. it's a gamble. but
you make a good argument.

24
00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:38.700
In that case. <i>he's</i> the
only one who fits the bill.

25
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.870
Right? Only one striker
kept up with us in that game.

26
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.300
Yeah.

27
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:49.950
You're the only one who can join this
chemical reaction without disappearing...

28
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.450
Chigiri Hyoma.

29
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.750
Join us.

30
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.930
We need your legs.

31
00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.270
Listen. Kunigami.

32
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.220
Don't forget.

33
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.440
We haven't beaten Isagi yet.

34
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.160
I'll hold on to this frustration we share.

35
00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:21.490
I'll be waiting for you. hero.

36
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.370
Reo.

37
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.750
That last play only worked
because it was against you.

38
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.630
Because you're so good.

39
00:02:37.631 --> 00:02:42.530
we knew you had the skill to pick out a pass.
even in that impossible situation.

40
00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:45.720
so Isagi and I took the risk.

41
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.700
It was a close one.

42
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.230
I knew already. but you're amazing.

43
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.020
So I'm going on ahead. but I know we'llâ€”

44
00:02:54.021 --> 00:02:55.190
Then. why not pick me?

45
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.310
I don't need you consoling me.

46
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.100
Give it to me straight.

47
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.740
You don't care about me anymore. do you?

48
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.810
You've changed.

49
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.120
You've forgotten our promise that
we'd become the best in the world <i>together</i>.

50
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.100
If you're gonna abandon me.
then damn well do it properly.

51
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.860
So if I choose you now.
will you be satisfied?

52
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.890
Then what? We'll be a team.
sure. but it won't excite us.

53
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:32.350
Is becoming the best in the world that easy?

54
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.730
You're the one who's forgotten our promise.

55
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.390
To be honest...

56
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.400
I'm past caring.

57
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.620
You're a hassle. Reo.

58
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.310
I'm done with you.

59
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.910
Hey. Reo.

60
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.710
Become the one who chooses.
not the one waiting to be chosen.

61
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.030
What are you playing soccer for?

62
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.200
Only those with the potential to be the best
striker in the world can survive in Blue Lock.

63
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.680
Don't look down! Watch them go!

64
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.250
If our heads drop now. we're done for!

65
00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:25.490
Kunigami Rensuke
Mikage Reo

66
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.490
Move Back
to the
2nd Stage

67
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.870
Isagi Yoichi
Nagi Seishiro

68
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.870
Barou Shouei
Chigiri Hyoma

69
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.960
Move up to the
4th Stage

70
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.010
Episode 19

71
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.430
An "imaginary friend"?

72
00:06:11.431 --> 00:06:16.680
Yup. That "monster" must be
a friend only you can see.

73
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.060
Am I weird?

74
00:06:19.061 --> 00:06:20.660
Not at all.

75
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:24.230
This "friend" of yours plays the
soccer you want to play. right?

76
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:25.230
Yeah.

77
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:33.120
But. Mom. I want a real friend
who can play fun soccer with me.

78
00:06:33.121 --> 00:06:34.440
I know.

79
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.580
I hope you'll make one someday.

80
00:06:36.581 --> 00:06:38.920
Yeah! I know I will!

81
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.890
If Rin's team is still at the fourth stage.
we can play them next. right?

82
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.790
Hey. you guys listening?

83
00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:04.410
4th Stage

84
00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:04.410
Break Room

85
00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:04.410
(for 4 people)

86
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.400
Your teammate's asking
something real important over here.

87
00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:01.990
Hm?

88
00:07:01.991 --> 00:07:03.000
What's up?

89
00:07:03.001 --> 00:07:04.400
Um. well...

90
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.290
In addition to Nagi and Barou. we now
have the selfish princess that is Chigiri.

91
00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:12.070
Things are gonna get a lot tougher.

92
00:07:12.071 --> 00:07:13.410
Hey. shitheads!

93
00:07:13.411 --> 00:07:18.290
Which one of you left these socks inside out
and this wet bath towel on the floor?

94
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.540
Oh. the socks are mine.

95
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:23.170
I'll deal with them after I dry
my hair. so leave them there.

96
00:07:23.171 --> 00:07:26.570
The bath towel's mine.
Could you put it in the washing machine?

97
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:28.060
Do it yourself!

98
00:07:28.061 --> 00:07:30.510
Don't leave them lying around! Do it now!

99
00:07:30.511 --> 00:07:31.130
No can do.

100
00:07:31.131 --> 00:07:32.260
That's a hassle.

101
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.590
Dry your hair properly!
Water's dripping everywhere!

102
00:07:37.591 --> 00:07:39.020
It'll dry eventually.

103
00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:42.310
How long are you gonna take?!
Deal with these first. prick-cess!

104
00:07:42.311 --> 00:07:44.820
I don't wanna be <i>told</i> to do it.

105
00:07:44.821 --> 00:07:46.190
Oh boy.

106
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:48.440
Put your shit away!

107
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.790
This is the bad type of chemical reaction.

108
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.790
You disgusting slob!

109
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:51.650
It's absolute chaos!

110
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.650
Don't screw with me. donkey!

111
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.490
All right. guys. stop fighting.
Why don't we go get some food?

112
00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:57.990
I'm good. It's time for my leg care.

113
00:07:57.991 --> 00:07:59.910
I'm gonna watch some videos.

114
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.380
They're so damn self-centered!

115
00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:03.500
I'll come.

116
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.610
You two. clean up your
junk before I get back!

117
00:08:07.611 --> 00:08:08.380
All right.

118
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:24.980
We came here together.
but he hasn't said a word.

119
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.159
Is he still mad at me because
of what I said during the match?

120
00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.260
You donkey.

121
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.230
I was all hyped up when I said it.
but maybe I overdid it...

122
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:40.900
Yo. Isagi.

123
00:08:40.901 --> 00:08:41.750
Yes?!

124
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:49.670
I. uh. just wanted to ask you what
you see when you're out on the field.

125
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.580
What kind of soccer do you want to play?

126
00:08:54.770 --> 00:09:01.310
Oh. um. well. my weapons are
my spatial awareness and my direct shot.

127
00:09:01.311 --> 00:09:04.600
so I added movement off the ball
to the mix to get myself in position.

128
00:09:04.601 --> 00:09:06.190
Huh.

129
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.860
So that's how you control the field?

130
00:09:09.861 --> 00:09:11.370
Coulda told me sooner.

131
00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:13.400
Uh. I told you the other day.

132
00:09:13.401 --> 00:09:18.660
Oh. and I realize now I went too far with
some of the stuff I said. even if it was to win.

133
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:19.810
Hm?

134
00:09:19.811 --> 00:09:24.060
I asked you to take back calling me a "donkey."
but you were right on everything else.

135
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:24.740
What?

136
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.210
I wasn't mature enough. That's all.

137
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.380
I'm not some chicken who can't change
after learning the meaning of pain.

138
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:36.100
I'm stronger now because I've died
once and crawled my way back up.

139
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:40.350
Seriously. dude. You're so cool.

140
00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:42.600
So c'mon. spit it out.

141
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:45.750
What kind of soccer do you
wanna play with this team?

142
00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:47.380
Thank you. Barou.

143
00:09:47.381 --> 00:09:48.150
Huh?

144
00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.480
I really like who you are right now!

145
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.400
Well. I don't.

146
00:09:55.401 --> 00:09:59.390
I mean. I'm trying to learn more
about you so I can devour your talent

147
00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:02.070
and crush you completely.

148
00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:06.660
If you're thanking a villain. it's only a
matter of time till a new lead takes over.

149
00:10:06.661 --> 00:10:10.550
Yeah. bring it on!
I'll tell you everything about me!

150
00:10:10.551 --> 00:10:13.880
And I'll evolve twice as fast as you!

151
00:10:13.881 --> 00:10:15.510
Hmph. Talk about naÃ¯ve.

152
00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:17.720
I'll evolve three times as fast.

153
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.340
And I'm not just devouring you.
I'll devour them. too!

154
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.890
Is this mine?

155
00:10:27.891 --> 00:10:29.110
Dunno.

156
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.110
What are you watching?

157
00:10:32.111 --> 00:10:35.900
Some "Sweet tekkers" clips.
I wanna learn how to control the ball.

158
00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:38.990
This guy's really good. isn't he?
I wanna copy him.

159
00:10:38.991 --> 00:10:42.280
Seriously. man? That's Noel Noa.

160
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.490
Who's that?

161
00:10:43.491 --> 00:10:46.090
He's the number one striker
in the world right now.

162
00:10:46.091 --> 00:10:47.980
Oh. that explains it. then.

163
00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:49.750
He's really good.

164
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.030
Are you serious?

165
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.280
You really don't know
anything about soccer. do you?

166
00:10:55.281 --> 00:10:57.840
It's criminal how good you are. considering.

167
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.140
Thanks.

168
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:03.400
By the way. did you injure
your leg or something?

169
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.270
You mentioned leg care.

170
00:11:05.271 --> 00:11:07.270
Yeah. I did.

171
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:12.400
My right leg is both a
ticking clock and a partner.

172
00:11:12.401 --> 00:11:14.790
Wow. Does it hurt?

173
00:11:14.791 --> 00:11:16.360
Not anymore.

174
00:11:16.361 --> 00:11:18.860
Though if I bust it again. I'll be in trouble.

175
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:20.910
But I have no regrets.

176
00:11:20.911 --> 00:11:24.830
Every day. I run with that resolve.

177
00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:27.790
Whoa. That's cool.

178
00:11:27.791 --> 00:11:32.500
There are a bunch of people I need to beat
before I can become the best in the world.

179
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:36.420
But y'know. Nagi. there are lots <i>more </i>
amazing players with killer first touches.

180
00:11:36.421 --> 00:11:38.410
Really? Tell me who they are.

181
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.580
How much potential do we have?

182
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:51.480
What kind of soccer can I play with a
reborn Barou. as well as Nagi and Chigiri?

183
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.750
I can't wait to play those guys!

184
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.860
They'd better be cleaning in...

185
00:12:00.861 --> 00:12:01.740
What?!

186
00:12:01.741 --> 00:12:04.450
It's even <i>messier</i> than before!

187
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.490
Nice. You did it with a shoe. too.

188
00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.120
What the hell are you two doing?

189
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.250
We were watching some video clips.
and I had to try it out.

190
00:12:13.251 --> 00:12:15.880
It's Nagi Seishiro's "Let's Control
Everything!" championship.

191
00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.960
Hey. that's my shoe!

192
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:19.950
Wanna try?

193
00:12:19.951 --> 00:12:23.300
Just you wait. Rin and Bachira.

194
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.300
I doubt it somehow.

195
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.900
I'll give in to this surge of excitement
and face whoever stands in our way.

196
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:30.250
We're gonna win!

197
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:32.890
Let's go.

198
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:34.100
One more time!

199
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.110
Nice. Rin-chan.

200
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.690
Are you finally getting serious?

201
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.650
Shut up. You're still half-baked. Bob Cut.

202
00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.370
But it's fun to play with me. right?

203
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:51.830
You'll never beat me with
dribbling that relies on feel.

204
00:12:51.831 --> 00:12:54.540
We won't know that until we try.

205
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.750
But I do know. It may look like you're
having fun when you're dribbling...

206
00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.400
but really. you're just afraid to fight alone.

207
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.300
You're looking for someone with your soccer.

208
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:10.010
A half-baked ego like that doesn't excite me.

209
00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:26.660
Bachira Meguru loved soccer.

210
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.740
Awake or asleep. from dawn until dusk.

211
00:13:30.741 --> 00:13:34.000
he had a ball with him at all times.

212
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:36.900
He especially loved dribbling.

213
00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.060
Sometimes. he felt like...

214
00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:41.710
Hey. this might work.

215
00:13:41.711 --> 00:13:46.170
...he had become one with the ball.
which was the best feeling ever.

216
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:53.970
"There's nothing in the world more fun
than this." That's what he believed.

217
00:13:53.971 --> 00:13:54.930
Boom!

218
00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.420
This is boring.

219
00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:00.310
Let's go home and play video games.

220
00:14:00.311 --> 00:14:02.020
What? Why?

221
00:14:02.021 --> 00:14:04.710
You should try to be one with the ball. too.

222
00:14:04.711 --> 00:14:07.040
'Cause then you can do amazing stuff!

223
00:14:07.041 --> 00:14:09.570
There's nothing more fun than soccer!

224
00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.290
You scare me.

225
00:14:13.291 --> 00:14:14.490
You've got girls' hair.

226
00:14:14.491 --> 00:14:16.870
Let's go. guys. Forget this weirdo.

227
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.370
I'm not a weirdo!

228
00:14:19.371 --> 00:14:21.000
Huh? You creep me out.

229
00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.210
I'm <i>not</i> a weirdo!

230
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.140
Shut up. jerk!

231
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:29.640
You're not a weirdo. Meguru.

232
00:14:29.641 --> 00:14:31.250
I know. Mom.

233
00:14:31.251 --> 00:14:33.390
They're the ones who were doing it wrong.

234
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.240
Well. I wouldn't say that exactly.

235
00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.980
It's just they can't feel what you feel.

236
00:14:40.981 --> 00:14:43.350
Then. what am I supposed to do?

237
00:14:43.351 --> 00:14:46.240
I just want to play soccer with people.

238
00:14:46.241 --> 00:14:48.400
It's way more fun than video games.

239
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.450
You're a good boy. Meguru.

240
00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:55.440
It's a wonderful thing to have
something you want to believe in.

241
00:14:55.441 --> 00:14:57.430
Live your life. believing in it.

242
00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:03.420
Everyone wants to believe in something. but as
they grow older. they find they can't anymore.

243
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:06.380
So they pretend they
can't hear the voice inside.

244
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.630
until eventually. they can
no longer hear what it's saying.

245
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:15.140
What you're trying to believe in
is so fleeting yet important.

246
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:23.140
That voice is the voice
of the monster inside you.

247
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:28.030
Your mom believes in that voice. too.

248
00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:34.230
So it's okay to believe in this feeling of joy
that only I get when playing soccer?

249
00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.030
Ready?

250
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.040
And so. Meguru...

251
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.880
started playing soccer with the monster.

252
00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:53.010
Remember our "one team" spirit!

253
00:15:53.011 --> 00:15:55.930
We all fight for our one goal of victory!

254
00:15:55.931 --> 00:15:57.390
All right!

255
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.140
The sky is such a pretty blue.

256
00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.140
One team!

257
00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:01.940
Pass to me. Bachira!

258
00:16:01.941 --> 00:16:03.970
But that's no fun.

259
00:16:03.971 --> 00:16:05.980
I wanna pass to three steps beyond that.

260
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.800
The monster would know how to
apply a super-special finish to that!

261
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.200
Ah. too high! I can't reach <i>that</i>!

262
00:16:13.201 --> 00:16:15.660
Bachira! You could've passed it to feet!

263
00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.360
My bad.

264
00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:22.090
The sun isn't red. It's white.

265
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:28.110
"There has to be someone <i>
who feels the same joy I do."</i>

266
00:16:28.111 --> 00:16:31.220
<i>Goal! Noel Noa!</i>

267
00:16:31.221 --> 00:16:36.850
"After all. the strikers on the screen
play like the monster does."

268
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:40.220
"Someday. I want to play soccer like that."

269
00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.760
National High School Soccer Championship Chiba Prelims Final

270
00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.760
Namikaze

271
00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.760
Arashi Technical High

272
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:46.250
"I want to find someone who can share
this joy with me at its deepest level."

273
00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:46.980
Bachira!

274
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.190
So slow.

275
00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.780
You can't beat the monster like that.

276
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.990
What are you doing?
You held onto it too long!

277
00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:01.970
Stop ball-hogging!

278
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:06.530
Meguru continued to believe
in the voice of the monster

279
00:17:06.531 --> 00:17:10.530
which most others ignored until they
could not longer hear it at all.

280
00:17:10.531 --> 00:17:15.220
And he continued to believe in the fun of
soccer. which can be so easily forgotten.

281
00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:17.119
But...

282
00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.430
Sometimes. he'd get scared.

283
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.230
If he stopped making those plays
that make no sense. he could go pro.

284
00:17:27.231 --> 00:17:28.580
He should've passed there!

285
00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:30.860
Pay more attention to us!

286
00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:35.440
What if he never met
anyone who understood him?

287
00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:41.020
What if he continued to play soccer alone?

288
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:45.260
Am I... a weirdo?

289
00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.530
That thought made Meguru feel
like he might die of loneliness.

290
00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.330
Welcome home. Meguru.

291
00:17:58.730 --> 00:17:59.590
What's wrong?

292
00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:02.970
Nothing. Just a little tired.

293
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.060
Some mail came for you.

294
00:18:06.061 --> 00:18:06.820
Huh?

295
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.230
Bachira Meguru-sama

296
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.230
You have been selected

297
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.230
to become a certified athlete

298
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.260
Good job! You should go!

299
00:18:14.261 --> 00:18:15.570
Is it getting more fun now?

300
00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.200
Yeah!

301
00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.210
Huh?

302
00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:25.750
Noel Noa?!

303
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.960
Ronaldo!

304
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.230
Messi!

305
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:30.190
Zico?!

306
00:18:30.191 --> 00:18:32.170
Hey. Zico. Pass!

307
00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.910
Hey! Pass the ball. Zico!

308
00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.370
Whoever's struck by the ball is "it."

309
00:18:43.371 --> 00:18:47.850
Whoever's "it" the moment time
runs out will be locked off.

310
00:18:47.851 --> 00:18:50.380
Also. no using your hands.

311
00:18:50.381 --> 00:18:52.820
What? This isn't soccer.

312
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.320
He's still asleep. Gotcha!

313
00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.820
Hey. that's a foul.

314
00:19:06.821 --> 00:19:09.480
If this were a game. that'd be a red card.

315
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:11.490
Only handballs are against the rules. right?

316
00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.040
Morning.

317
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:16.460
Hey. I'm not a fan of dirty play.

318
00:19:16.461 --> 00:19:18.460
Play fair.

319
00:19:18.461 --> 00:19:20.430
Mr. Strait-Laced. huh?

320
00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.850
In Blue Lock. there were sure to be
many players with varying styles.

321
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.030
and there had to be someone
as good as the monster.

322
00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:39.400
You little shit! Get off of me!

323
00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.400
Here's your chance.

324
00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:43.450
This place. where he could play soccer
for real. was like a paradise to him.

325
00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:45.820
Ow.

326
00:19:45.821 --> 00:19:47.290
Get off me!

327
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:53.090
Oh. shit. Wait. timeout.

328
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.960
Isagi-kun. hit him! Before it's too late!

329
00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.840
But then. what if there was
no one here better than the monster?

330
00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.710
No one who understood him...

331
00:20:05.711 --> 00:20:06.910
That's not right.

332
00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:11.140
If I don't change.
I'll still be the same person.

333
00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.690
I came here to change my life.

334
00:20:13.691 --> 00:20:16.150
I came here to become
the best in the world.

335
00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.070
I like you.

336
00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:26.250
If that happened. he'd go back to those days
where he felt like he might die of loneliness.

337
00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:28.830
You're right. If you're
gonna beat someone...

338
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.020
...it should be the strongest one here.

339
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:34.710
No.

340
00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.190
I don't want to be alone anymore.

341
00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:40.800
So even though I'm a little scared...

342
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.270
if I don't find anyone here.
I'd be beyond sad.

343
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.640
Okay. Right there.

344
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:53.940
The true monster I've been waiting for.
longing for. searching for. for so long...

345
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.350
If this "friend" exists. he'll be right there.

346
00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:59.520
Found him.

347
00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:03.200
The strongest guy...

348
00:21:03.201 --> 00:21:03.950
Boom!

349
00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.580
Meguru felt like he'd been told:

350
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:11.660
"Pass it to him."

351
00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.530
"This is the monster."

352
00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:20.250
That's why Meguru believes in Isagi Yoichi.

353
00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:28.050
Ever since then. I've believed
Isagi Yoichi was the one

354
00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:32.890
who could understand my soccer the best.
and share the joy of it with me.

355
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.830
And that hasn't changed.

356
00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:38.630
But...

357
00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:41.520
It may look like you're having
fun when you're dribbling...

358
00:21:41.521 --> 00:21:43.740
but really. you're just afraid to fight alone.

359
00:21:43.741 --> 00:21:46.030
You're looking for someone with your soccer.

360
00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:51.470
Hey. Rin-chan. How'd you know
I was looking for someone?

361
00:21:51.471 --> 00:21:52.470
Huh?

362
00:21:52.471 --> 00:21:55.290
No one's said anything
like that to me before.

363
00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:00.250
The guy who noticed the monster inside me...

364
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:04.040
I have a monster inside of me.

365
00:22:04.041 --> 00:22:06.130
Huh? What does that mean?

366
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:10.650
Um. I guess it's like a vision
of the soccer I want to play.

367
00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:14.890
I came to Blue Lock to find
that monster in real life.

368
00:22:14.891 --> 00:22:16.520
Who cares?

369
00:22:16.521 --> 00:22:19.380
Because you're so obsessed
with something that childish.

370
00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.860
your play is wimpy and half-baked.

371
00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:26.530
Go play soccer with your monster
for the rest of your life.

372
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.990
In the meantime. I'm going to
become the best in the world.

373
00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:36.330
Maybe he's another monster
I don't fully understand yet.

374
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.640
A different kind from Isagi.

375
00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.220
Yo. Bachira. I've been looking for you.

376
00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:49.600
Isagi...

377
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:54.930
As I promised. I've come to get you back.

378
00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:59.390
And Meguru fights to find out...

379
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:03.120
Let's do this. Rin.

380
00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.480
...which of these two monsters.

381
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:12.940
Isagi Yoichi and Itoshi Rin.
can delight his heart more.

382
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:18.000
Blue Lock. Additional Time!

383
00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:15.370
Additional Time!

384
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.920
Blue Lock

385
00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.330
Guess the three of us will
have to team up to advance.

386
00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.980
The Team of
Late Starters

387
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:22.330
Yeah.

388
00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:26.710
Iemon Okuhito

389
00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:26.710
Because of your rep as a traitor.
no one wants to team up with you. right. Kuon?

390
00:23:26.711 --> 00:23:29.060
Yeah. sorry about that.

391
00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:32.260
Kuon Wataru

392
00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.260
It's totally fine if you want
to choose someone else.

393
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.860
Nah. it's all good.

394
00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:37.270
Imamura Yudai

395
00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.320
Iemon and I are both late starters
'cause we were slow to clear the last stage.

396
00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:41.700
I'd rather team up with
someone I know and move forward.

397
00:23:41.701 --> 00:23:45.650
than get disqualified
'cause we're being picky.

398
00:23:45.651 --> 00:23:49.180
But if you betray us again.
you'll be sentenced to death!

399
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:50.780
Kuon + Imamura + Iemon
teamed up

400
00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.900
Point!

401
00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:52.860
Seriously. if I ever do it again.
you can just end me. I mean it.

402
00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:56.500
Ah. finally.

403
00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.580
Kuon + Imamura + Iemon
teamed up

404
00:23:57.581 --> 00:24:01.850
I finally get to play in a position
that isn't the goalie!

405
00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:08.070
Looking back. I haven't done anything
remotely striker-like since I got here.

406
00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.130
Ah. it's been so long.

407
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.460
But those days of anguish end now.

408
00:24:14.461 --> 00:24:16.970
At long last. I can take
my first steps as a striker...

409
00:24:16.971 --> 00:24:18.810
Iemon. you're in goal again. 'kay?

410
00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:26.510
No... no... I don't wanna...

411
00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.400
I'm only kidding!

412
00:24:24.401 --> 00:24:27.190
Sorry. sorry. There's no need to cry.

413
00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.330
Medic!

414
00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:33.570
Due to Iemon
passing out.
their start was
even more
delayed.
