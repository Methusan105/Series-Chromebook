1
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.010
Rock. paper. scissors!

2
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.450
Damn it! Isagi won!

3
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.670
Then. staring with Isagi-kun. we'll each 
say which position we want to play in.

4
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.590
I wanna be the forward.

5
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.340
The first selection will involve
 the 55 of you in Building 5.

6
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.340
1 Hour Earlier

7
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.100
It's a kind of five-team round robin.

8
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.120
Only the top two teams progress. 
The rest will leave Blue Lock.

9
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.300
And those who are kicked out will forever
be ineligible for the national team.

10
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.780
However. the top scorers from the three losing
 teams will advance to the next selection.

11
00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:01.040
When all the matches are over

12
00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:01.040
Yellow card:

13
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.770
If more than one player has the most goals
 in a team. we'll go by fair play points.

14
00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:01.040
2 Yellows in
1 game (sent off):

15
00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.040
Red card:

16
00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.040
Yellow card. 
then straight red:

17
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.040
If the points are tied. the 
higher-ranked player progresses

18
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.040
If the points are tied. the 
higher-ranked player progresses

19
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.040
and the player with the least 
penalty points will progress.

20
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.240
Will you prioritize your own goals
 or the team's victory?

21
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.460
The karma of a striker is put 
to the test in this first selection.

22
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.670
This is a battle about 
creating soccer from zero.

23
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.270
The first match starts in two hours. 
It will be Team X versus Team Z.

24
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.390
Team Z

25
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.390
Locker Room

26
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.390
5 minutes

27
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.390
before the match

28
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.390
All right. everyone.

29
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.890
Isagi

30
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.890
Bachira

31
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.890
Imamura

32
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.890
Kunigami

33
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.890
Raichi

34
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.890
Gagamaru

35
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.890
Kuon

36
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.890
Naruhaya

37
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.890
Igaguri

38
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.890
Chigiri

39
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.890
Iemon

40
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.890
This is our formation for the first match.

41
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.140
We'll go for the win with Isagi-kun 
as our focal point at center forward.

42
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.350
Gotcha.

43
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.520
Isagi's ranking is super low. 
Can we win with him as our focal point?

44
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.480
Stop complaining. Igaguri.

45
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.860
I don't wanna play in defense.

46
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.700
All we gotta do is win. right?

47
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.950
No objections here.

48
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.660
"All we gotta do is win." huh?

49
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.490
Can you really play in goal?

50
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.910
I lost at rock paper scissors. 
so I'll just have to do it.

51
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.250
"A battle about creating soccer from zero"? 
What did he mean by that?

52
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.010
It's almost time.

53
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.050
My life-changing match at 
Blue Lock is finally about to begin.

54
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.390
Building 5

55
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.390
Center Field

56
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.470
Here they come. Team X.

57
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.990
Episode 3

58
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.990
Soccer's "Zero"

59
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.250
In the first selection. 
all fouls will be called by VAR.

60
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.810
Building 5's first match will be
 a half-game lasting 45 minutes.

61
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.020
Team X versus Team Z. Time for kick-off.

62
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.570
You scared. Isagi?

63
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.680
Let's have fun! Otherwise. 
we'll lose. That's how soccer is.

64
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.430
Right.

65
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.490
He's right. There's no need to be scared.

66
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.930
My rank is 274. I'm rock bottom.

67
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.110
I just need to play...

68
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.820
and climb up the ranks!

69
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.240
Should I pass it back
and build the attack?

70
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.120
Hey! What are you doing. Raichi?

71
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.410
The rules say the top scorer
 goes through. right?

72
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.330
I don't care about the team.

73
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.460
I'm doin' this my way.

74
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.680
Now you're talking. Raichi.

75
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.770
If that's how it works here. 
I'll make no bones about playing for myself.

76
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.410
Kunigami. I think we're 
gonna get along just fine.

77
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.440
What're ya doing?!

78
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.520
Lemme in on it!

79
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.360
Hey! What about our positions?!

80
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.390
Get outta my way!

81
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.570
You get outta mine.

82
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.580
Damn it...

83
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.280
Y'know. your physique ain't too bad...

84
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.580
Lucky!

85
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.110
You should pay more attention.

86
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.870
Huh? They're fighting among themselves too?

87
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.500
What's going on here?

88
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.720
They're all only thinking 
about themselves.

89
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.840
This is a battle about 
creating soccer from zero.

90
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:37.310
Is this sorry bunched-up free-for-all what 
he meant by "creating soccer from zero"?

91
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.940
This isn't soccer.

92
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.880
What do I do?

93
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.850
Should I... go join them?

94
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.950
He broke free?

95
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.410
Don't stand in my way.

96
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.040
Or I'll kill you.

97
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.880
Team X
BL Ranking

98
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.880
th

99
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.840
I'll stop him.

100
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.760
He's here. Is he going left?

101
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.010
A heel flick?

102
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.420
Crap. he got past me.

103
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.680
I'm sorry. Kuon! He's heading your way!

104
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.720
Okay! I got it! Don't sweat it. It's a two-on-one!

105
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.470
Two nutmegs in a row?

106
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.770
What the hell is he?

107
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.480
He's big and he's got skills!

108
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.320
I couldn't react...

109
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.630
Now hear me. suckers. 
and remember my words.

110
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.330
For me. the ball isn't my "friend"
 or any nonsense like that.

111
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.450
It's just a spherical servant 
that exists solely so I can shine.

112
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.720
On the field. I am the king.

113
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.250
I-Is it even possible 
to beat a guy like that?

114
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.340
Awesome!

115
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.850
Nice play. Barou!

116
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.350
King Barou!

117
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.960
You're the goalie. aren't you? Act like one!

118
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.660
But I've never done this before. 
What am I meant to do?

119
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.960
It's only one goal. Let's calm down.

120
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.030
He's right. If we stick to our
positions and pass it aroundâ€”

121
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.990
Huh? If we do that. then as the
 center-forward. you'll be the one who scores.

122
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.410
Losers should play in defense.

123
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.700
All ya gotta do is pass me the ball!

124
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.910
Hell no! Pass it to me!

125
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:16.580
Huh?!

126
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.290
No. to me.

127
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.620
No. to me! To me!

128
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.660
Team Z. resume the game.

129
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:23.930
Calm down.

130
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.420
The match has only just begun.

131
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.130
I mean. what are we even being tested on?

132
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.630
Regardless. we have to win.

133
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.380
As long as that guy doesn't get the ball...

134
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.560
Bachira! We'll at least 
pass it around between us!

135
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.020
Okay.

136
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:42.980
Huh? Igaguri. your position!

137
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.430
Are you dense. Isagi?
 The top scorer on a team survives!

138
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.730
I'm never passing to someone else.

139
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.740
I'm sorry for your loss.

140
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:50.740
Hey. hold it!

141
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.910
Now I get what this first 
Blue Lock selection is all about.

142
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.700
It's a battle where you only 
pursue your own ability to score!

143
00:07:58.910 --> 00:07:59.830
Crap!

144
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.040
You suck. It's mine now.

145
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.090
You lost the ball? I'll kill you!

146
00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.380
Igaguri. you dumbass!

147
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.130
Stay back. guys! We gotta defend!

148
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.880
Hey. let's pass the ball 
to Barou and support him.

149
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.400
See how the other team's 
having a total meltdown?

150
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.820
Rather than chasing individual goals.
 we just need to win as a team.

151
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.390
Good call. Barou!

152
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:22.310
Leave the right wing to me!

153
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.310
I got the left!

154
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.650
I'm leaving the defending to you!

155
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.650
This isn't good. 
They're starting to get organized.

156
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:28.570
It's Barou.

157
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:29.610
We gotta mark Barou!

158
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.110
Who're you to tell us that. Igaguri?!

159
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.440
Damn. We gotta stop him.

160
00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:39.330
You sure throwing so many 
lousy players at me is a good idea?

161
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:42.700
It's no good.

162
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.460
If we leave Barou alone. he'll scythe through 
our defense. but if we only mark him...

163
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.250
Look at all that wide-open space!

164
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.380
...other players are left totally free!

165
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.050
Save it. Iemon!

166
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.930
All right!

167
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.340
A second goal!

168
00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.300
Thank you. King Barou!

169
00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.420
Crap. We're gonna lose at this rate.

170
00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.230
They're already playing as a team.

171
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.770
It's 'cause you lost the ball. Igaguri!

172
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.940
But we're not coordinated at all.

173
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.480
I told you guys to stop him!

174
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.060
Huh?!

175
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.570
You try saving it if you think it's so easy!

176
00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.570
Stop fighting!

177
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.400
Damn it. I can't do this!

178
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.790
Nice goal!

179
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.430
They were all bunched-up too. a while back.

180
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:13.940
Yeah!

181
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.990
He changed all that.

182
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:21.660
Barou's goal helped them to become a team!

183
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.370
This is a battle about 
creating soccer from zero.

184
00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.360
If we call this bunched-up. 
free-for-all soccer "zero."

185
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.840
then Barou's stunning play
 isn't zero. it's "one."

186
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.490
Let's grab another goal!

187
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.050
A strategy to win is then
 built around this "one."

188
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.170
Yeah!

189
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.020
And that's how a team is born.

190
00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:45.460
Is this what he meant by 
"creating soccer from zero"?

191
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.190
If it is. we're totally useless.

192
00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:56.510
The bigger the goal deficit gets. 
the more they think about themselves.

193
00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.340
No one's in the right mindset to think 
about how to get from "zero" to "one."

194
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.660
Meanwhile. the opponent's teamwork
 keeps improving.

195
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.460
It's impossible.

196
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.370
This game is over.

197
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.880
We've... lost.

198
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.430
Man. all I've been doing is running around.

199
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:27.180
There's no way we'll score five
 in the next three minutes.

200
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.400
But maybe you and I
 can get one goal back.

201
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.650
Bachira...

202
00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.020
At 5-0. the other team's guard is down.
 so we might make it work this once.

203
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:41.990
You in?

204
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.620
I'm in.

205
00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:51.800
I will turn this team's "zero" into a "one"!

206
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:05.430
I'll distract them. then hit a long ball
 upfield so you can take the shot.

207
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:06.900
Run. Isagi.

208
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.230
Straight to the goal.

209
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:10.190
Okay. Bachira.

210
00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.610
I'm gonna make this shot!

211
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.860
Huh? Isagi-kun?

212
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.570
A comeback might be impossible.

213
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:22.660
but if someone scores a goal. we can 
build the team structure around it.

214
00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.370
That's what it means 
to go from zero to one.

215
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.620
Surround him!

216
00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.580
Bachira and I can score a goal together.

217
00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.750
To win the next match. 
that's what we need to do.

218
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.830
Right there. Isagi.

219
00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.000
That's the light we need to lead Team Z!

220
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:37.500
Bull's-eye.

221
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.210
Yes!

222
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:39.900
Nice pass. Bachira.

223
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.700
It's a one-on-one.

224
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.120
I'll score it!

225
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.550
Hey. Number 11.

226
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.350
Don't stand out more than me.

227
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.690
I told you I'm the king.

228
00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.770
Try getting past me. sucker.

229
00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.480
What's he doing here? 
Did he read my plan?

230
00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.530
What do I do? Try to get past him?

231
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:01.810
But it's this guy...

232
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.740
In a situation like this. a striker would...

233
00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.120
Isagi! Behind you!

234
00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:08.830
Pass it to me!

235
00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:10.750
I'll shoot!

236
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:11.460
Here!

237
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.620
Do I pass?

238
00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:13.120
No.

239
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.830
I gotta go for it!

240
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.790
If I want to live in Blue Lock...

241
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:19.050
If I want to live as a striker...

242
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:34.770
Huh?

243
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.150
Nice ball. Isagi.

244
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.110
There's no way he'll score from that range.

245
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.960
Eat it!

246
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.880
I passed... the ball...

247
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:07.020
What the hell are you doin'. Isagi? 
Why'd ya pass it to Kunigami?!

248
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.350
I was more open than he was!

249
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.630
No... I was planning to shoot.

250
00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:14.940
But for some reason. my body justâ€”

251
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:19.860
You stupid? Like. seriously stupid? 
Who passes when they're shaping to shoot?!

252
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.020
Hey. hey. hey!

253
00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.570
Stop that. Raichi!

254
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:23.930
We scored a goal!

255
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.830
Huh?! Are you stupid. too?

256
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:29.910
Why should I be happy someone who
 isn't me scored a goal in a 5-1 defeat?

257
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:34.620
Didn't ya listen to the rules? At the end of
 the day. it's the top scorer who goes through!

258
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.580
But he had a chance to score and passed!

259
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.890
Why the hell did ya even come here? Huh?!

260
00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:41.130
I don't know...

261
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.510
But that pass was... unintentional...

262
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.430
What?!

263
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.100
Hey. Number 11.

264
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:51.430
If you get nervous in front of goal. 
you're not cut out to be a striker.

265
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.520
You have no talent.

266
00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:02.680
Time's up.

267
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:07.780
In Blue Lock Building 5's 
first match. Team X wins 5-1.

268
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.670
What am I doing?

269
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.340
Didn't I say I was going to
 turn the zero into a one?

270
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:24.810
Am I...

271
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.750
unfit to be a striker?

272
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:33.310
Isagi

273
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:33.310
Bachira

274
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:33.310
Imamura

275
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:33.310
Kunigami

276
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:33.310
Raichi

277
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:33.310
Gagamaru

278
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:33.310
Kuon

279
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:33.310
Naruhaya

280
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:33.310
Igaguri

281
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:33.310
Chigiri

282
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:33.310
Iemon

283
00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:33.310
First off. it was a mistake to 
make Isagi the center forward!

284
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.770
In the next game. 
it'll just be me up top.

285
00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:39.230
No. it should be me. 
We can win if I'm the center forward.

286
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:42.190
I'm never playing in 
defense again. you hear?

287
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:43.980
Losers can shut up.

288
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.330
What? Says the loser who
Isagi didn't wanna pass to.

289
00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:48.580
You wanna go?!

290
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.360
Do you?!

291
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.620
If you get nervous in front of goal. 
you're not cut out to be a striker.

292
00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.270
You have no talent.

293
00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.540
Why did I pass?

294
00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:03.880
I haven't changed at all 
since I got here. Damn it.

295
00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:09.970
To survive in Blue Lock. 
what am I lacking as a striker?

296
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.820
Just pass the ball to me!

297
00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.180
No. to me!

298
00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:12.930
Give it to me!

299
00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:13.800
Me. Pass to me.

300
00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:15.600
That's enough. all of you!

301
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:18.730
Kuon...

302
00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:20.990
Do you understand the situation we're in?

303
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.690
We're a team that's already lost once.

304
00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.320
Huh?

305
00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.660
This first selection is 
a five-team round robin.

306
00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.860
Only the top two teams progress.

307
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:37.520
Suppose all teams win two. lose two. 
We'd all be on six points.

308
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:42.780
Which means. in order to advance. 
we have to aim higher and get seven points.

309
00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.140
That's the likely cut-off line 
that will decide who progresses.

310
00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:51.220
So in short. if you lose twice. it's a 
yellow light that's about to turn to red.

311
00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:55.470
We're already at the point where if we 
lose the next game. we're done for.

312
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:59.680
If we don't get serious about how we're 
going to win. it really will be over for us.

313
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.190
Then. have you got any good ideas?

314
00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:06.540
Uh. well... No. not yet...

315
00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.970
What the heck? 
Then. what good is all this talk?

316
00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:11.530
But still. we have to do somethingâ€”

317
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.530
I have something.

318
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:15.710
I couldn't have scored that goal
 without Bachira and Isagi.

319
00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.580
That should show us the way.

320
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:22.190
Cut the crap. musclehead! 
You just wanna be the team's top scorer!

321
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.690
But it was amazing.

322
00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:27.710
It was the best goal of the day. for sure.

323
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:28.490
You're naked!

324
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:30.170
If we just do that a lot. we can win.

325
00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.760
Right. Isagi? Right?

326
00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.720
Bachira...

327
00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.760
Oh. please! It was a fluky wonder goal. 
You can't rely on that!

328
00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.330
And c'mon. dude. stop streaking!

329
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:44.690
But seriously. I really don't get how 
we can make a team out of just forwards.

330
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:49.320
I don't think everything 
that guy says is right.

331
00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.450
Chigiri.

332
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:55.460
Ego talked about how to "win" the World Cup.

333
00:16:55.460 --> 00:17:00.020
throwing names like Cristiano Ronaldo.
 Messi. and Cantona out there.

334
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.790
But none of those guys have
 ever won the World Cup.

335
00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:14.190
If anything. him saying "This is a battle about 
creating soccer from zero" was some sort of hint.

336
00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.070
Hey. everyone.

337
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.100
I don't have any strategies
 that'll help us win.

338
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:23.310
but I might know what it means
 to be at soccer's "zero."

339
00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:23.850
Hm?

340
00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:26.670
So what is it. noob? Explain it to us.

341
00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:32.510
In today's game. all anyone was thinking 
about at the start was scoring themselves.

342
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.570
and that led to a bunched-up free-for-all.

343
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.600
That's probably what it 
means to be at "zero."

344
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.020
Well. that really wasn't soccer at all.

345
00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.340
That's true.

346
00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:46.590
The thing that broke through 
that "zero" was Barou's goal.

347
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.340
It acted as a catalyst. creating a clear path 
for goals. which led them to play as a team.

348
00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:59.180
Barou used his talents to turn the "zero" 
of chaotic bunched-up soccer into a "one."

349
00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:04.870
Using that as a guiding principle. 
a team can evolve into a "10" or even a "100."

350
00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:09.470
So what's required is the
power to produce that "one."

351
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:12.900
Only this irresistible trait and 
talent can make it possible.

352
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:16.660
A striker is someone who 
turns a "zero" into a "one."

353
00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:21.130
and the other positions 
multiply it to "10" and "100." huh?

354
00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:28.830
So did Ego add that rule about the team's top
 scorer surviving to make us figure that out?

355
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.230
Most likely.

356
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:34.430
Because of that rule. 
our egos were exposed.

357
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:37.380
and we were forced to 
play by and for ourselves.

358
00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.720
without thinking about 
positions or tactics.

359
00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:48.520
And our egos have to clash 
before we can truly become a team.

360
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:50.690
Soccer...

361
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:52.020
A team...

362
00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.390
They are created by 
an irresistible striker.

363
00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.020
That must be Ego's message to us.

364
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.880
Yes. very good. You're on the right track.

365
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.740
Hi there. diamonds in the rough.

366
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:08.200
The second match in 
Building 5 just finished.

367
00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.710
Team V beat Team Y. 8-0.

368
00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.590
What? 8-0?!

369
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.090
Wow.

370
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:19.130
You're on the right track.

371
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:23.700
but it seems you still have no idea
 how to turn zero into one.

372
00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:27.780
First. let's talk about this country. Japan.

373
00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:33.440
The Japanese love to have roles allocated
 to them so they can just complete their tasks.

374
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.190
As an example. take one 
of the few major sports

375
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.750
where Japan is on par 
with the rest of the world:

376
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.270
Baseball.

377
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.130
Its inning system has distinct 
periods for offense and defense.

378
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:46.410
and there's no physical
 contact out in the field.

379
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:53.390
Each role is clearly defined in this sport. 
and it fits the Japanese psyche like a glove.

380
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:54.920
That's why we're so strong at it.

381
00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.630
But that's not the case in soccer.

382
00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.960
It has an open field where offense and 
defense alternate as the situation demands.

383
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.690
And it can be very physical.

384
00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:09.600
In this sport. you can't win by simply 
doing the tasks you've been given.

385
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.220
Which is why you need personal skills.

386
00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.540
Individual skills.

387
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:22.100
In Japanese soccer. the positions we can be 
proud of are our midfielders and full-backs.

388
00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:26.820
They work like dogs for the team. They turn 
the "one" created by the striker into 100.

389
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:32.790
Without the devotion of those players. 
Japanese soccer wouldn't be where it is now.

390
00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:35.470
Therefore. there will be no revolution.

391
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:41.050
So diamonds in the rough. 
overwrite your consciousness.

392
00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:47.060
In soccer. scoring a goal means 
destroying the other team's structure.

393
00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.510
Which makes a striker a destroyer.

394
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:54.250
The act of scoring is a revolution on the field.
 where you wreck the other team's order.

395
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:59.190
Diamonds in the rough. do not let yourselves
 get trapped in by the notion of roles!

396
00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:01.690
Or you won't create one from zero.

397
00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.840
Take up your weapon. strikers!

398
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.120
Identify it clearly.

399
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:14.660
Which weapon will you use to mess with the 
other team. make them yield. and destroy them?

400
00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:19.500
Think hard about what you can do 
with your body and your mind!

401
00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:23.840
It's always your weapon that kick-starts
 this revolution known as scoring!

402
00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.590
Victory can only exist 
once you get beyond that.

403
00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.230
A weapon...

404
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:40.170
That's the breakthrough we need 
to win in this first selection.

405
00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.210

You're trying to skip.

443
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.540
No. it must be broken!

444
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.880
A full-body muscle strain and 
compound fracture or something!

Crazy posture.

I knew he didn't have a broken bone.

478

Lying brat.
