00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.240
That was sick!

2
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.700
Wait. did he seriously fake shot it
 into the air with some crazy spin.

3
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.950
then when it floated down.

4
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.260
took the shot again and scored?

5
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.080
That was a miraculous bit of skill!

6
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:34.760
Calling something like that "miraculous"
shows just how average you are. Anri-chan.

7
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.850
B-But that was top-drawer stuff. wasn't it?

8
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.060
It's not like you could reproduce that
 any time you want. No way.

9
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.160
I don't know about that.

10
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.290
The iron mentality that you will score.
 the skills to make it happen.

11
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.810
the situation on the field. 
the environment the player is in...

12
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.350
If all conditions are optimal. a performance
 can go beyond human understanding.

13
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.120
Miraculous events can 
be explained. Anri-chan.

14
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.390
And a formula for them awaits 
at the end of this selection.

15
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.670
Nagi! Nice goal!

16
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.550
We're only level. We need another.

17
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.010
I finally did it.

18
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.760
I beat Rin for the first time!

19
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.390
With Nagi. I can go head-to-head with Rin!

20
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.630
But that won't help me to become 
the best striker in the world.

21
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.230
I want to be able to beat Rin by myself!

22
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.150
Sweet.

23
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.670
This is where the monster party begins.

24
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.050
Okay. the real game starts now.

25
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.370
My spatial awareness
and Nagi's first touch.

26
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.800
We've proved we can beat Rin if 
we combine our strengths effectively.

27
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.380
But that goal can't be reproduced unless 
we repeat the many moves that got us there.

28
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.650
Power

29
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.650

34

To beat Rin. it's imperative
 we create a condition

84
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.030
And the fact that this is a real seesaw game

85
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.610
is proof that my eyes and brain have
 evolved and are on the same level as his.

86
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.940
If we can make it a 50-50 with Rin.
 our weapons can work against him!

87
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.130
But... so what?

88
00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:03.170
If I can't beat Rin on my own. 
I can't become the best striker in the world.

89
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.530
Just being equal isn't enough.

90
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.670
I have to read the play and get to the 
future of this field before Rin does!

91
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.300
Wh-Wh-What do we do now? 
They caught up to us.

92
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.270
We won't let it end this way.

93
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.290
Stop babbling.

94
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.050
From now on. I'm in control of this field.

95
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.990
If you want to win. 
bust a gut to keep up with me.

96
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.330
Uh. is he mad?

97
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.370
He's unusually fired up.

98
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.460
Love it. Show us your 
serious mode. Rin-chan.

99
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.300
Okay. let's go. 
The second half has kicked off!

100
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.410
What? This way? But wait... 
In the path of the scary gorilla?

101
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.980
Please get outta my way!

102
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.930
You messed up. I'll get there first.

103
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.190
No. before Barou can get to the ball...

104
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.030
the backspin will take it toward Tokimitsu!

105
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.450
Oh. hey. maybe I will reach it.

106
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.990
Tch. A shoulder charge.

107
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.940
His muscles are no joke.

108
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.040
He made Tokimitsu hold up the ball while
 he moves to a better position to receive it.

109
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.180
A first-time pass from there?

110
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.840
Crap! He's one step faster than I can read!

111
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.250
Hm?

112
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.290
Unlike Bachira Meguru's
 creative pass earlier.

113
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.400
this is a lofted pass that tests my limits.

114
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.180
I only have one option.

115
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.270
I accept the challenge.

116
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.310
Aerial Chest Takedown!

117
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.610
Neat. Still caught up to you. though.

118
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.280
Sneaky bastard. If you position 
yourself there with that timing.

119
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.950
I have no choice but to 
pass to you. Itoshi Rin!

120
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.240
Nagi! Block Rin's shooting paths!

121
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.370
I'm already gone.

122
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.990
A two-on-two out in front.

123
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.590
Will he shoot. dribble. or pass to Bachira?

124
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.300
A shot? No...

125
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.600
Don't charge in. Just put out a leg.

126
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.310
I know it's a feint. 
I won't fall for it a second time!

127
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.730
Huh? A roulette there? That's impossible.

128
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.060
I saw through you.

129
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.970
I got there. I was one step
 ahead of Rin's vision!

130
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.610
You're two steps too slow.

131
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.570
Where is it?

132
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.780
You're giving it to me now?

133
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.510
Huh? When did...

134
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.000
Wait. he read my thoughts?!

135
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:42.130
I see. So you weren't reading him at all. 
You were being manipulated.

136
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.700
Are you serious?

137
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:49.430
Tokimitsu's physique. Aryu's powerful jump. 
and even my reading of the field...

138
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.010
All of us were just...

139
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.430
Itoshi Rin's puppets!

140
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.650
So this is Rin's serious mode.

141
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.690
This "puppet master" style of soccer!

142
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.110
What made you think a mere 
NPC like you could read me?

143
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.660
Rin-chan. you super sadist.

144
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.390
So that's Rin's serious mode. huh?

145
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:23.000
He controls everyone on the field. 
regardless of whether they're friend or foe.

146
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.840
High five!

147
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.630
Hm? No high five. then?

148
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.110
Don't touch me. NPC No. 2.

149
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.800
Come to think of it. it was the 
same when we first faced him.

150
00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:39.810
The essence of his soccer is to control 
people by manipulating their thoughts.

151
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.980
He only did it when it 
involved himself before.

152
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.080
but now. he's manipulating 
everyone on the field!

153
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.570
And he achieves this by 
assessing each of our skills

154
00:07:53.570 --> 00:08:00.230
and cranking them up to their full potential 
to create the high-level future he envisions.

155
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.420
It's a technique that's only 
possible with the right skills.

156
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.000
an eye for tactics. 
and the physique to pull it off.

157
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.880
You're really that incredible. Itoshi Rin?

158
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.110
Can I really devour a genius like him?

159
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:20.370
If we try anything conventional. he'll read it.

160
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.350
We have to break away from
his vision of the field. right?

161
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.810
You said it.

162
00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.550
We need to make it so he can't 
keep up. even if he sees the logic.

163
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:33.280
The level of difficulty will be super high. 
but if we use our weapons to the max...

164
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.240
There's a chance we can outrun him.

165
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.380
Yeah.

166
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:37.820
Let's go.

167
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.130
It's the only way.

168
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.540
If it doesn't work. then...

169
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.070
Read the field. There's no room for error!

170
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.800
I'll trigger a chemical reaction
and launch an all-out attack!

171
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.470
They changed up their defense?

172
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.500
Now Rin's pressing and Bachira's the anchor.

173
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.940
What's the play here?

174
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.190
I don't get it.

175
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.020
I will bet on your speed.

176
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.990
Sticking to the same old pattern. huh?

177
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.990
Shut up.

178
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.610
I'm best at straight-lining it.
 but since they'll be ready for that...

179
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.200
I'll flick it. cut inside at top speed...

180
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.540
and leave him for dust!

181
00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.620
Nice. Chigiri!

182
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.000
We broke through their line. 
Let's use this momentum to crush them!

183
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.050
Rin. Of course he sensed the danger.

184
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.930
Should I take him on?

185
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.510
No. if he's out here...

186
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.470
there's one less player inside!

187
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.600
Go for it. Nagi!

188
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.680
A cross with spin that wakes you up.

189
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.010
It's coming.

190
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.910
A bunched-up two-on-two.

191
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.990
Tokimitsu's going for the tackle. 
and Bachira's waiting to see what Nagi does.

192
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:55.550
So I'll target their blind 
spot and run outside!

193
00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.320
Then. when Bachira reacts. 
I'll change direction...

194
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.160
Right here?

195
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:04.700
...and complete the crossover 
by running past on the inside!

196
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.330
Perfect.

197
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.380
We're in behind. 
Now all that's left is for me to score!

198
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.550
Huh? You're kidding. right?

199
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:17.800
But how?

200
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.850
Did he read my vision from behind and 
recover to the spot where he knew I'd be?

201
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.230
What do I do? Do I shoot?

202
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.060
No. he'll just block my shot.

203
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.690
At least I can keep possession...

204
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.200
Damn it. That won't work. 
Not with my physique.

205
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.610
Even our perfect chemical reaction

206
00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:41.650
is nothing but a puppet show in his 
mind's eye when he's in serious mode!

207
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.170
I win this one. Isagi.

208
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.130
It's mine!

209
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.750
Barou?!

210
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.960
Huh?! He stole it from his teammate?!

211
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.980
That guy...

212
00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.130
Is he serious?

213
00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:02.340
Did he just steamroll
through Rin's imagination?

214
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:08.450
He's been waiting patiently 
with an empty stomach...

215
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.480
for the chance to strike at 
his prey from its blind spot...

216
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.820
for the moment of the hunt
 that will satisfy his hunger!

217
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.400
What kind of soccer is this?

218
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.830
I see.

219
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:26.700
Stealing from your teammate isn't in 
his playbook. so he can't anticipate it.

220
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.290
That's why it worked!

221
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.780
Against Rin's meticulous playstyle.

222
00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.680
Barou's playstyle as the 
villain of the field is...

223
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.130
an anomaly he can't control!

224
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.940
That's the whole basis of King Barou's game!

225
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.150
What's the matter?

226
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.440
Why don't you try to control me...

227
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.150
Mr. Absurdly-Long Bottom Lashes?

228
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.020
I need more. Isagi.

229
00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.280
Heh.

230
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.900
I need more to devour.

231
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.160
Barou!

232
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.870
The King of the Heels.

233
00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:21.530
Barou's obsessed with devouring me.

234
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:25.550
and that makes him too much of an 
anomaly for Rin's genius to predict.

235
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:30.350
Due to Rin's playstyle of
processing everything rationally.

236
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:34.880
he couldn't read the selfish soccer 
of Barou Shouei. King of the Heels.

237
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.950
I see.

238
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.300
I need to be someone Rin can't read.

239
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.260
That way. he can't control me.

240
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.320
Barou's the bug in this field's programming.

241
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:51.920
He is the key to vanquishing Rin.

242
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.980
Who knows how this 
match will play out now?

243
00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.290
What's wrong with that gorilla man?

244
00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:59.880
It's not so easy anymore. is it. Rin-chan?

245
00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:03.840
I've already inputted what I need.
 It won't happen again.

246
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:08.950
We'll use the Barou bug to 
create something unpredictable!

247
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.100
Chigiri. can you beast 
them with your pressing?

248
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.450
I want you to put pressure on 
the ball carrier with your speed.

249
00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:20.270
Okay. I'll make them dance for me.

250
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:23.370
That means I'm marking the glam guy.

251
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.410
Try and outrun me. genius.

252
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.090
Cool. So you want me to
dribble through 'em. huh?

253
00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:42.300
Isagi?

254
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.290
All right. let's have some fun—

255
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:48.720
You're keeping your distance? 
You're wary that I'll get past you. huh?

256
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:51.020
Whoa. it's Chigirin.

257
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.890
Damn. man. So fast.

258
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.140
I got it.

259
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:59.560
So you're using your speedster to press and 
making it a two-on-one by doubling up on me.

260
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:03.490
Oh. hey. Rin-chan's waiting 
for the ball in a great spot.

261
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:08.100
No. Isagi's responding to his movement.

262
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:13.300
Oh. I see. By using Chigirin to confuse us 
and slow down our decision-making.

263
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.540
Isagi's giving himself time to keep up 
with Rin-chan's off-the-ball movements.

264
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:21.330
In that case. I'll just have 
to carve open a route by myself.

265
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.800
I've never gone up against 
you before. Bachira.

266
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.130
True! Please go easy on me.

267
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:30.890
It's my dribbling versus Chigirin's speed!

268
00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.180
Wow. He's crazy fast.

269
00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.040
Even if I steal a yard on him.
 he can recover in no time.

270
00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.230
In that case...

271
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.410
Roll up. roll up!

272
00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.480
Which way will I go?

273
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.480
I'm halfway past him. I can pass it now.

274
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.280
Huh? Isagi?

275
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.150
Weren't you over by Rin-chan?

276
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.490
Surely you weren't waiting for me to do that?

277
00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.290
Crap. He got me.

278
00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.370
No. I can squeak between them...

279
00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:58.160
There!

280
00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.410
Just barely!

281
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.500
All righty!

282
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.530
Now...

283
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.520
Devour him. Barou.

284
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.660
Thanks.

285
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:09.470
They really got me. It was all to set up Barou.

286
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:14.930
Isagi used himself as bait and created 
a path for Barou to steal the ball.

287
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:16.390
No! Stop!

288
00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.430
Go! Get past him and you can score!

289
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:20.810
Move aside. Glum Guns.

290
00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.400
A chop feint?

291
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.440
This is how to use the anomaly named Barou.

292
00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.780
You're not getting through.

293
00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:30.540
Rin?

294
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.950
Rin-chan!

295
00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.820
The ball is out of play. 
Throw-in to Team White.

296
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.410
Aw. damn it!

297
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.070
No. he didn't read that.

298
00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.130
He reacted just in time.

299
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:49.590
Rin positioned himself somewhere he could
 respond to Barou's unpredictable play.

300
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:55.600
One wrong move. and either Rin or I
 could have given up a goal there.

301
00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:59.870
I'm using Barou's 
unpredictability to its maximum.

302
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:04.100
while Rin's trying to 
minimize the damage he can do.

303
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:08.830
The one who can control Barou 
and this field will win this match!

304
00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.200
They're incredible.

305
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.240
They're reading each other and 
competing at an unbelievable level.

306
00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:23.790
There are two monsters on this field now.

307
00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.380
I'm seeing the soccer 
I've always wanted to play...

308
00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.470
unfold right in front of my eyes.

309
00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.570
My dream is finally coming true.

310
00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.510
I can play soccer with monsters!

311
00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:43.250
Huh?

312
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:48.980
What? I'm right here. and yet...

313
00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:53.190
I'm no longer alone. and yet...

314
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:56.870
In the world these two inhabit...

315
00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.450
I don't exist.

316
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.000
Why?

317
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:06.210
Why are you two playing soccer
 in a place unknown to me?

318
00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:07.920
Don't leave me behind.

319
00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:11.590
For me. you two are the 
monsters I've been looking for.

320
00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.800
But what am I to you?

321
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.060
Was I the one being tested?

322
00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.850
The ball is out of play. 
Throw-in to Team Red.

323
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.440
Nice. Chigiri!

324
00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.980
Sorry. I was actually 
planning on passing to you.

325
00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:36.820
I'm sorry. too. If I'd been one step faster. 
I could've gotten the ball.

326
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.940
Hey. are you all right?

327
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:41.950
Is it your knee?

328
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:44.800
No. I'm just running on empty.

329
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.850
But don't worry about me.

330
00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:49.880
If you lose to Rin. I'll kill you.

331
00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.090
I know.

332
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.860
And you keep those legs 
motoring until you keel over.

333
00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.610
You don't need to tell me.
 That was already my plan.

334
00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:03.540
Thanks to Chigiri's pressing. I'm able to 
keep up with Rin's reading of the field.

335
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:07.610
But it's impossible to keep 
running around at that speed.

336
00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:10.080
And it's not just Chigiri.

337
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:14.400
Everyone's stamina is draining 
at a rapid rate. me included.

338
00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:19.170
If we keep up this kind of maximum-level
 performance and end up tired.

339
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:22.660
the quality of our passing and 
initial movements will be affected.

340
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:28.250
The one who catches these changes will 
dominate the final phase of this match!

341
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.250
Wah! I-I'll return the ball. Rin-kun!

342
00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:34.050
Me again?

343
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.620
What is this attack?

344
00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:37.780
Crap.

345
00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.510
These two are forging upfield.

346
00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:43.050
This is a new pattern.

347
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:47.170
They're moving the ball before Chigiri 
can press or I can make a decision.

348
00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:50.980
But it's not like Rin's doing 
anything special with his passes...

349
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:52.940
No. that's not true!

350
00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:55.730
The player making this 
breakaway possible

351
00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:59.110
is the only one who hasn't slowed 
at all in this final phase of the game.

352
00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.080
Hold it!

353
00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:01.700
and who keeps moving in 
response to Rin's passes.

354
00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:00.750
Stop him. Barou!

355
00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:05.950
It's the guy with the monster 
physique and unlimited stamina!

356
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:09.410
There's more to Tokimitsu than his muscles!

357
00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:13.250
Ah. finally. The pass into the 
box that'll open things up...

358
00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:15.450
Oh no you don't!

359
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:16.920
Wait. huh?

360
00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:22.430
For a tackle from behind 
and malicious sliding respectively.

361
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:25.760
Barou Shouei and Chigiri Hyoma
 both get yellow cards.

362
00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.030
Huh?! I was just hugging the guy!

363
00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:29.860
I went for the ball!

364
00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.060
Do your job properly. you useless VAR!

365
00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:36.400
I-I'm sorry. Rin-kun. I only got a free kick.

366
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.730
Damn it.

367
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.360
That chemical reaction between 
Rin and Tokimitsu just now

368
00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:44.370
could've been avoided if 
I'd caught it before Rin did.

369
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.830
But it's not like they scored from it.

370
00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:51.580
This free kick won't go 
the way they want it to!

371
00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:55.050
I'm not liking the distance.

372
00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.210
It's totally within range for Rin.

373
00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:58.440
Scooch this way a bit.

374
00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.420
Right. A two-man wall. huh?

375
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:04.650
Will he go for the shot or choose to pass?

376
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.180
Those are Rin's only choices.

377
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.480
My choices are: be part of 
the wall in case he shoots.

378
00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.180
Wall

379
00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.180
Wall

380
00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.560
and if he passes. dart to the side 
where we're outnumbered.

381
00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.560
Press

382
00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.560
Press

383
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.460
But if I jump. I'll be slow into the press.

384
00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.070
I need to wait for the 
moment he kicks it to decide.

385
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.890
Is it a shot? Or a pass?

386
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:22.860
Which one?!

387
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.990
Huh?

388
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:30.200
A topspin shot that starts 
dipping just above my head?

389
00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.120
He got me.

390
00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.610
He didn't give me time to react.

391
00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:40.510
It was an ultra-fast pinpoint
 free kick just above me!

392
00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:43.340
You wavered between 
pass and shot. didn't you?

393
00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.970
Your analysis is so off.

394
00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.920
This situation was never
two choices to begin with.

395
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:50.100
My goal.

396
00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.840
That was the only choice.

397
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.470
I see.

398
00:20:54.470 --> 00:21:01.110
Both Rin and Isagi are listening to their 
own egos and scoring goals for themselves.

399
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:07.140
Then. why am I... playing soccer?

400
00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:11.290
To find the "true monster"?

401
00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.740
Because I want "a friend"?

402
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:21.050
No. I won't catch up to 
those two with reasons like that.

403
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.370
What is my ego?

404
00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:33.060
Episode 21

405
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:33.060
I'm Not There

406
00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:04.200
A

407
00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:06.680
Blue Lock. Additional Time.

408
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:04.360
Additional Time!

409
00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:04.570
Additional Time!

410
00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:04.780
Additional Time!

411
00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:04.990
Additional Time!

412
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:05.820
Additional Time!

413
00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:06.030
Additional Time!

414
00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:05.910
Blue Lock

415
00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:05.950
Blue Lock

416
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.990
Blue Lock

417
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.030
Blue Lock

418
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:06.240
Blue Lock

419
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:06.240
Additional Time!

420
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:06.990
Blue Lock

421
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:06.990
Additional Time!

422
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.970
Another Team of Three

423
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.970
Another Team of Three

424
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.970
Part\h\h\h2

425
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.970
Part\h\h\h2

426
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:15.700
Niko Ikki

427
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:15.700
Niko Ikki

428
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:10.920
I need to think long and hard 
about who to team up with.

429
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:15.720
The clever choice would be to pick
someone with a weapon I don't have.

430
00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:18.870
Someone useful... Someone useful...

431
00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:23.030
Oh. hey. He's super-fast and super-dumb.

432
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:24.090
Tsurugi Zantetsu

433
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:24.090
Tsurugi Zantetsu

434
00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:24.090
Hm?

435
00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:27.710
Zantetsu-kun. have you decided 
who you're going to team up with?

436
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:31.470
Well. for now. I'm waiting for Nagi and Reo.

437
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:33.760
Maybe he'll fit the bill.

438
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.470
Are you sure they haven't moved on already?

439
00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.350
I guess there's a logic to that.

440
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:44.580
Aw. man. Now I have to zero-base reschedule.

441
00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.480
I don't think he'd 
entertained that possibility.

442
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.320
Well. what about teaming up with me?

443
00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.960
What would be the merries
 of this commitment?

444
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.130
Do you mean "merits"?

445
00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.090
Yeah. those.

446
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:01.120
I can use you better than anyone else can.

447
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:05.060
The 
dude 
with 
the 
bangs

448
00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:05.060
He
gives
me
orders

449
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:05.060
I play 
awesome

450
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.550
Mission

451
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.550
Accomplished

452
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:07.090
Go! Zantetsu-kun!

453
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:10.580
I don't really make mistakes.

454
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:11.380
Deadly Striker

455
00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:13.970
I can hide my stupidity and look cool!

456
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.290
Very well.

457
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:18.220
They do say. "Yesterday's 
friend is today's friend."

458
00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.420
You mean "Yesterday's enemy."

459
00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.610
He really is dumb.

460
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.030
So? Who else do you want to pick?

461
00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:27.650
Our other member should be...

462
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.820
Zantetsu 
+ Niko 
teamed up

463
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.820
some guy who actually makes sense.
