ï»¿1
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.436
<i>I am a striker!</i>

2
00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:21.938
<i>Someone once said:</i>

3
00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:23.815
<i>"In the world of soccer.</i>

4
00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:29.112
<i>you can train first-rate goalkeepers.
defenders. and midfielders.</i>

5
00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.406
<i>but strikers are different."</i>

6
00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:38.663
<i>"A first-rate striker will find
where the soccer is most intense</i>

7
00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:41.207
<i>and suddenly appear there."</i>

8
00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:22.684
{\an8}BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT

9
00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:24.561
{\an8}A PLACE IN THE QUARTERS
SLIPS FROM THEIR GRASP

10
00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.688
Let me be blunt.

11
00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:29.524
If things carry on the way they are.

12
00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:32.485
{\an8}Japan will never win
the World Cup. Not in a million years.

13
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.078
We're making plenty of dough.
so what do we care?

14
00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:43.580
After all. soccer's a business.

15
00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:46.791
Anri. surely you don't really believe

16
00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:50.169
{\an8}Japan has a chance
of winning the World Cup?

17
00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:53.923
{\an8}Of course I do. you money-grubbing rodent.

18
00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:56.509
{\an8}It's my goddamn dream!

19
00:02:57.093 --> 00:02:59.220
"If we just play our soccer. we can win"?

20
00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:02.348
"Japan's possession of soccer
is good enough for the world stage"?

21
00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:07.186
That kind of thinking is exactly
why we never make it past the last 16!

22
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.564
Well. you came up with this idea.

23
00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:12.609
laid the groundwork.
and put it all in motion.

24
00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:16.821
{\an8}So if it doesn't work out.
I know whose head will roll.

25
00:03:17.488 --> 00:03:21.159
I truly believe the only person
who can break down Japanese soccer

26
00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:26.164
and forge a player who can lead
this country to a World Cup win...

27
00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:28.249
is this man right here!

28
00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.169
<i>Ego Jinpachi.</i>

29
00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.259
Isagi?

30
00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.845
What are you doing?

31
00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:44.724
Wait. what is this? What just happened?

32
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.562
I'm sorry. It's just...
The ball came at me out of nowhere and...

33
00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.023
Don't give me...

34
00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:57.278
<i>Diamonds in the rough.
only results matter here.</i>

35
00:03:57.362 --> 00:04:00.031
{\an8}Losers lock off.

36
00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:02.825
{\an8}Kira Ryosuke. you are disqualified.

37
00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.169
This is bullshit.

38
00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:19.092
How is it possible
for my future career to lie in tatters

39
00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:22.053
all because of some stupid game?

40
00:04:22.136 --> 00:04:24.305
I'm Japanese soccer's jewel in the crown!

41
00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.892
You telling me Igaguri and Isagi
are more talented than me?

42
00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:31.020
Why does this silly game
of tag even matter?

43
00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.356
What does it have to do with soccer?

44
00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:38.528
<i>In Blue Lock. everything has
something to do with soccer.</i>

45
00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:40.697
<i>Look around you. Mr. Mediocre Elite.</i>

46
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.157
<i>The room you are in...</i>

47
00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:47.745
<i>is the same size as the penalty area.</i>

48
00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:53.084
<i>Roughly 75% of all goals
are born within these confines.</i>

49
00:04:53.167 --> 00:04:57.297
<i>If you can't do your work in this space.
you have no talent as a striker.</i>

50
00:04:58.047 --> 00:05:00.008
So... So what?

51
00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:02.218
Tag is nothing like soccer!

52
00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.887
If you're the one running away.

53
00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:06.347
<i>you need a keen sense</i>

54
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:08.433
<i>of interpersonal space.
tactics. and positioning.</i>

55
00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:10.810
{\an8}<i>If you're the one doing the chasing.</i>

56
00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:13.604
{\an8}<i>your dribbling and aim must be precise.</i>

57
00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:15.565
{\an8}<i>and the quality
of your kicks must be high.</i>

58
00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:18.818
<i>That makes it
an excellent soccer training drill. wimp.</i>

59
00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:23.948
Even so. how can you know
anything about me in just two minutes?

60
00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.658
A soccer match is 90 minutes!

61
00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:27.160
On average.

62
00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:30.580
the total amount of time any player
spends on the ball in a 90-minute game

63
00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:32.957
is about 136 seconds.

64
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:36.294
You wasted the chance
that was afforded to all of you equally.

65
00:05:36.377 --> 00:05:39.297
But nothing could be done
in those last ten seconds...

66
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.883
{\an8}Would you say the same thing
if this was a match?

67
00:05:43.384 --> 00:05:48.431
<i>When the ball hit you. there was
still one second left on the clock.</i>

68
00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:51.976
<i>You could've survived if you'd blasted it
at the immobile Igaguri.</i>

69
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.020
<i>But you didn't see it.</i>

70
00:05:54.103 --> 00:05:57.523
<i>In a way. it was the last play
right before the final whistle.</i>

71
00:05:57.607 --> 00:06:03.571
<i>The moment your teammate's shot hit you.
you gave up and accepted defeat.</i>

72
00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:06.491
<i>That's why you didn't see it.</i>

73
00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:10.745
<i>You missed your chance at victory
by not taking that extra step.</i>

74
00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.124
<i>Whoever is "it" in this game of tag</i>

75
00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:18.795
might be the loser
if he holds onto the ball for too long.

76
00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.296
But he might also be the winner.

77
00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:23.466
as only he has the power
to choose who is hit next.

78
00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:29.806
<i>A striker shoulders that responsibility
and fights until the very last second.</i>

79
00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:35.812
<i>Isagi Yoichi targeted someone ranked
higher than him. not the fallen Igaguri.</i>

80
00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:40.733
<i>Bachira Meguru stole the ball off him
and went after the strongest guy.</i>

81
00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:44.028
<i>That's a selfish obsession with victory</i>

82
00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:46.864
<i>that isn't affected
by the group's common sense.</i>

83
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.285
<i>That's the egoism
of the striker that I'm looking for.</i>

84
00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:54.205
You lost because you ran away from it.

85
00:06:54.288 --> 00:06:56.457
<i>Kira Ryosuke. lock off.</i>

86
00:06:57.083 --> 00:07:00.878
But... But he came at me...

87
00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:03.548
Bachira came out of nowhere...

88
00:07:04.173 --> 00:07:08.010
Bachira came at me out of nowhere!

89
00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:10.805
Kira...

90
00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:16.060
{\an8}This isn't right.

91
00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:19.355
{\an8}It... can't be.

92
00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:30.867
<i>Why did I kick it?
Did I just end Kira's soccer career?</i>

93
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:32.618
<i>Then why...</i>

94
00:07:35.913 --> 00:07:38.583
<i>Why am I so pumped up?</i>

95
00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:40.418
<i>That guy...</i>

96
00:07:42.211 --> 00:07:44.630
Why did you pass it to me?

97
00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:47.884
If I hadn't kicked it. you would've lost.

98
00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:52.221
Because I knew you'd kick it.
It was written on your face.

99
00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:55.391
"Only results matter here." right?

100
00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:58.853
So I believed in you. and I won. right?

101
00:07:58.936 --> 00:08:02.106
<i>This guy's totally crazy.</i>

102
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.943
Is this ridiculousness going to continue?

103
00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:07.570
<i>"Ridiculousness"?</i>

104
00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:11.282
<i>You're right.
That's the world of "win or lose."</i>

105
00:08:11.365 --> 00:08:15.536
<i>Those world-class strikers
you so casually adore</i>

106
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.789
<i>put their lives on the line
like this every day.</i>

107
00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:23.794
<i>How does it feel to fight
for your career for the first time?</i>

108
00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:26.088
<i>Does it scare you? Does it excite you?</i>

109
00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.508
<i>This is normal in Blue Lock.</i>

110
00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:33.262
<i>Are you shaken up? Did it make
you go. "All right! I survived!"?</i>

111
00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:35.848
{\an8}That's what victory feels like.

112
00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:37.975
{\an8}Etch that into your brain.

113
00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:43.856
Every time you get a taste of that
pleasant sensation. your ego grows.

114
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.110
And that will elevate you to the height
of the world's greatest striker.

115
00:08:56.035 --> 00:09:00.998
<i>Congratulations. You have passed
the admission exam for the Blue Lock dorm.</i>

116
00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:02.458
All right!

117
00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:05.670
<i>There are 11 of you in this room.</i>

118
00:09:05.753 --> 00:09:08.548
<i>You 11 will be living together.</i>

119
00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:12.677
<i>At times. you'll work together.
Other times. you'll betray each other.</i>

120
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.096
<i>You will be rivals
who wreck each other's dreams.</i>

121
00:09:15.179 --> 00:09:16.389
{\an8}<i>Blue Lock...</i>

122
00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.976
{\an8}<i>Team Z.</i>

DAY 3
TRAINING ROOM

124
00:09:29.777 --> 00:09:31.529
RUNNING TEST

125
00:09:31.612 --> 00:09:33.114
Isagi! Igaguri!

126
00:09:33.197 --> 00:09:34.615
How can you talk about becoming

127
00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:36.576
the world's greatest striker
looking like that?

128
00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:39.579
You mere mortals should
go home before I make you cry!

129
00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:41.998
Shut up...

130
00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:44.709
Don't mind him.

131
00:09:44.792 --> 00:09:46.836
Isagi. do you want some water?

132
00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:48.462
Thanks. Kuon.

133
00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:49.630
JUMPING TEST

134
00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:51.215
-Ready. go!
-Ready. go!

135
00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.886
<i>Oh. hell. this guy's super athletic. too.</i>

136
00:09:57.471 --> 00:09:59.599
Isagi. are you not at your best today?

137
00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:01.100
Oh. well. you know...

138
00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:04.520
<i>That was actually my max.</i>

139
00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:06.480
<i>Talk about crushing your spirit.</i>

140
00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:08.441
BUILDING 5
CAFETERIA

141
00:10:09.525 --> 00:10:12.320
<i>At the cafeteria.
you get rice and miso soup.</i>

142
00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:14.905
<i>but your side dish changes
depending on your ranking.</i>

143
00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:17.158
Huh. natto. Must be nice.

144
00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:19.785
All I've been getting is pickled radish.

145
00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:21.621
Chin up. Igaguri.

146
00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:23.831
I'm jealous of the higher-ranked guys.

147
00:10:23.914 --> 00:10:25.166
I mean. just look.

148
00:10:25.249 --> 00:10:28.169
Seriously? Man. that looks tasty.

149
00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:36.344
Is he a caveman?

150
00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:40.431
I'm stealing your dumpling!

151
00:10:40.514 --> 00:10:42.558
Hey. pipsqueak. Give that back.

152
00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:46.395
Sorry. it's already in my belly! So good!

153
00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.313
You won't get away.

154
00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:48.898
Isagi. hide your food!

155
00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:51.108
Nah. they wouldn't want ours.

156
00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:54.445
TEAM Z
SLEEPING CHAMBER

157
00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:08.918
<i>I haven't got time for sleep!</i>

158
00:11:13.297 --> 00:11:16.717
<i>If I don't do something.
I'm sure to get "locked off."</i>

159
00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:19.970
<i>Everyone's better than me.
I don't see how I can beat them.</i>

160
00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:24.725
Isagi.

161
00:11:25.726 --> 00:11:26.644
Training alone?

162
00:11:26.727 --> 00:11:29.188
Huh? Well. yeah...

163
00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:31.607
Then. want me to train with you?

164
00:11:32.441 --> 00:11:34.819
TEAM Z
TRAINING FIELD

165
00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:36.779
Hey. Bachira.

166
00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:38.072
Yes?

167
00:11:38.155 --> 00:11:41.492
When we played tag.
you passed the ball to me.

168
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:44.453
Yup.

169
00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:47.665
Why did you think I'd aim for Kira?

170
00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:51.669
Well... I guess it's because...

171
00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:54.547
There's a monster inside of me.

172
00:12:03.013 --> 00:12:04.140
Go!

173
00:12:11.355 --> 00:12:12.731
Bachira!

174
00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:13.983
<i>So slow.</i>

175
00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:16.527
<i>No. the monster would...</i>

176
00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:23.075
Bachira! Pass it!

177
00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:25.494
<i>You can't beat the monster like that.</i>

178
00:12:28.956 --> 00:12:31.041
Hey. what are you doing?
You held onto it too long!

179
00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:32.710
Stop ball-hogging!

180
00:12:43.762 --> 00:12:45.097
<i>A "monster"?</i>

181
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:49.727
What do you mean?

182
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.314
When I'm playing soccer.
the monster comes out and talks to me.

183
00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:55.274
"Score a goal."

184
00:12:55.357 --> 00:12:56.692
"Weave about more."

185
00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:08.579
But in that moment. the monster
said to me: "Pass the ball to Isagi."

186
00:13:08.662 --> 00:13:11.207
"There's a monster
inside him too." it said.

187
00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:14.835
A monster?

188
00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:19.632
When I play. I listen to its voice.
That's all there is to it.

189
00:13:19.715 --> 00:13:22.176
You hear it too. right?
The monster's voice.

190
00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:24.720
<i>What the heck is he talking about?</i>

191
00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:27.640
<i>Though. when I kicked the ball...</i>

192
00:13:27.723 --> 00:13:30.226
<i>In that moment. I didn't recognize myself.</i>

193
00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:35.606
<i>I want to know
what this "monster" inside me is.</i>

194
00:13:35.689 --> 00:13:40.277
<i>Maybe finding that out will give me
a clue on how to survive Blue Lock.</i>

195
00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:44.448
Messi. Cristiano Ronaldo. Noel Noa...

196
00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:47.910
All amazing players
have monsters inside of them.

197
00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:50.788
It must be what proves you're a striker.

198
00:13:50.871 --> 00:13:52.498
That's what I believe.

199
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.501
So Isagi...

200
00:13:59.213 --> 00:14:02.341
I'm glad I came here
because I got to meet you.

201
00:14:05.386 --> 00:14:06.762
Okay. let's try it again.

202
00:14:06.845 --> 00:14:07.680
Sure.

203
00:14:08.472 --> 00:14:12.142
<i>What's wrong with this guy?
He's talking nonsense.</i>

204
00:14:13.018 --> 00:14:13.852
<i>But...</i>

205
00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:15.312
Come at me.

206
00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:16.939
<i>He gives me...</i>

207
00:14:19.775 --> 00:14:20.985
<i>courage.</i>

208
00:14:23.487 --> 00:14:26.657
Yeah. that's it!
That's how your eyes looked at the time.

209
00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.367
<i>I'm going to survive this.</i>

210
00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:32.997
<i>The results of the fitness tests
have been assessed.</i>

211
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.334
<i>Please return to your rooms
and confirm the latest rankings.</i>

212
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.840
Hey. Gagamaru.

213
00:14:42.923 --> 00:14:45.009
-What rank are you? Tell me!
-Hey. Isagi.

214
00:14:45.092 --> 00:14:46.260
Look at this.

215
00:14:46.343 --> 00:14:48.971
I shot way up from my old rank of 300.

216
00:14:49.054 --> 00:14:50.598
See? I'm at 275 now.

217
00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:52.308
What? That's amazing.

218
00:14:52.391 --> 00:14:54.310
Oh. you did. too. Look.

219
00:14:55.227 --> 00:14:56.061
Whoa.

220
00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:58.397
You're still one above me?

221
00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.149
You're my rival. huh?

222
00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:01.400
<i>Well. well.</i>

223
00:15:01.483 --> 00:15:04.612
<i>Hello there. diamonds in the rough.</i>

224
00:15:04.695 --> 00:15:07.615
<i>How are you enjoying life at Blue Lock?</i>

225
00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:09.241
Cut the crap!

226
00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:13.078
Do you really expect us
to improve in this crummy environment?

227
00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:16.332
Yeah. what he said. I want better food.

228
00:15:17.124 --> 00:15:19.001
<i>The environment's crummy</i> 

229
00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:22.212
<i>because your soccer skills
are crummy. duh. Idiots.</i>

230
00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:23.130
What?

231
00:15:23.213 --> 00:15:26.008
Let's talk a little bit about Blue Lock.

232
00:15:26.842 --> 00:15:30.512
In this facility. a total
of 25 teams from B down to Z

233
00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:34.224
are split into five groups.
one per building.

234
00:15:34.308 --> 00:15:35.351
Oh. and by the way...

235
00:15:36.518 --> 00:15:39.355
<i>Each team lost one person
after the game of tag.</i>

236
00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:42.441
<i>so there are 275 players left.</i>

237
00:15:42.524 --> 00:15:45.653
What? So I'm still dead last?

238
00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:47.237
I was happy for nothing!

239
00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:49.156
<i>Your rank decides your team.</i>

240
00:15:49.239 --> 00:15:53.577
<i>Ranks 1 through 11 are in Team B.
ranks 12 through 22 are in C...</i>

241
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:58.207
<i>In short. you Team Z guys
are the lowest-ranked in Building 5.</i>

242
00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.001
<i>These guys are in the lowest group?</i>

243
00:16:01.835 --> 00:16:03.837
Don't lump me in with these losers.

244
00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:04.755
What?

245
00:16:04.838 --> 00:16:06.048
Who you calling "losers"?

246
00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:08.092
Hey now. let's calm down.

247
00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:13.806
Higher-ranked players eat gourmet food
and get to train in better buildings.

248
00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:17.309
In here. the best soccer player is king.

249
00:16:17.393 --> 00:16:20.020
If you want
a better environment. win your way up.

250
00:16:20.854 --> 00:16:22.272
<i>All righty. then.</i>

251
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.985
{\an8}Let us begin the first selection.

252
00:16:29.905 --> 00:16:30.948
Itoshi Sae.

253
00:16:31.031 --> 00:16:33.742
You were a genius midfielder

254
00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:38.497
in the academy
of one of the world's top clubs. Royale.

255
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.542
But regulations stopped you
from playing in the first team.

256
00:16:41.625 --> 00:16:43.293
so you returned to Japan.

257
00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:48.507
Does this mean we'll get to see you
play in the domestic league?

258
00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:50.801
Over my dead body.

259
00:16:50.884 --> 00:16:53.012
If I have to play in a country like this.

260
00:16:53.095 --> 00:16:56.390
I'd rather play
with college kids in Germany.

261
00:16:56.974 --> 00:16:59.351
{\an8}NEW GENERATION
ONE OF THE WORLD'S 11 HEROES

262
00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:00.686
So...

263
00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:03.564
Do you have dreams
of representing your country

264
00:17:03.647 --> 00:17:05.566
at the international level in the future?

265
00:17:05.649 --> 00:17:07.568
None whatsoever.

266
00:17:07.651 --> 00:17:10.154
The national team
of a weak country like this one

267
00:17:10.237 --> 00:17:12.448
will never be the greatest in the world.

268
00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:15.784
My dream is to win the Champions League.

269
00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:20.039
There isn't a forward in this country
who's good enough for my passes.

270
00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:22.499
I was born in the wrong country.

271
00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:25.419
Hey...

272
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.631
Give me a break.

273
00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:34.219
This won't do. Sae!
The media's going to hate you.

274
00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:36.346
So? This country doesn't matter to me.

275
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.974
I only came back
'cause my passport expired.

276
00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:40.809
I know that. but...

277
00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:46.106
{\an8}JAPAN FOOTBALL
UNION PRESS CONFERENCE

278
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:50.652
Oh. yeah. I heard the JFU
was holding a press conference today.

279
00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:55.032
So that's how we plan
to train up a striker

280
00:17:55.115 --> 00:17:58.118
who can lead Japan to a World Cup win.

281
00:17:58.202 --> 00:18:01.080
Through this Blue Lock project.

282
00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:03.749
Even if you do produce a top striker.

283
00:18:03.832 --> 00:18:07.961
how can you guarantee
Japan will win the World Cup?

284
00:18:08.045 --> 00:18:13.592
Are you saying it's okay to ruin the lives
of 299 people just for one person's sake?

285
00:18:13.675 --> 00:18:15.094
Didn't their parents object?

286
00:18:15.177 --> 00:18:16.804
Well. that's...

287
00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:20.307
We respect the opinions
of the players themselves.

288
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.477
And their parents have
signed consent forms...

289
00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.187
"Ruin the lives of..."?

290
00:18:25.854 --> 00:18:27.397
Exactly!

291
00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:29.608
For Japanese soccer to move forward.

292
00:18:29.691 --> 00:18:32.569
we need this crazy project!

293
00:18:37.324 --> 00:18:39.034
Don't you all want to see it?

294
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:43.580
The moment this hero
of Japanese soccer is born.

295
00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:48.418
<i>The first selection will involve
the 55 of you in Building 5.</i>

296
00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:51.088
<i>It's a kind of five-team round-robin.</i>

297
00:18:51.672 --> 00:18:53.006
Only the top two teams will move on

298
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.051
to the second selection
in this survival match.

299
00:18:56.635 --> 00:19:01.515
So the 11 of us on Team Z
will play as a proper team?

300
00:19:01.598 --> 00:19:03.225
We're all forwards though.

301
00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:06.353
Why don't you be the goalie?
You have the face of one.

302
00:19:06.436 --> 00:19:09.481
Don't. I can't say no
when people ask me to do something.

303
00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:11.525
Then. I'll play center forward.

304
00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:13.485
-No. I will.
-No. me.

305
00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:15.445
-Igaguri. you can be in defense.
-No. me! I will!

306
00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:16.446
What?

307
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:21.285
<i>A team made up of 11 forwards?
That's crazy talk.</i>

308
00:19:21.368 --> 00:19:22.744
<i>Listen up.</i>

309
00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:25.497
<i>Soccer was originally
a sport all about scoring.</i>

310
00:19:26.123 --> 00:19:27.791
<i>You've been stupidly imprinted</i>

311
00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:30.669
<i>with the notions
of positioning and tactics.</i>

312
00:19:30.752 --> 00:19:34.673
<i>but all of those roles
only evolved over time.</i>

313
00:19:34.756 --> 00:19:39.052
<i>Soccer initially started out
with every player being a striker.</i>

314
00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:41.889
So play soccer as it was originally.

315
00:19:41.972 --> 00:19:44.850
Create soccer from zero with your brains.

316
00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:48.312
<i>"Create soccer from zero"?</i>

317
00:19:48.395 --> 00:19:49.938
<i>Japanese soccer has improved</i>

318
00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:52.441
<i>at an incredible rate
in the last quarter-century.</i>

319
00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:55.485
<i>even compared to the world standard.</i>

320
00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:59.114
<i>Just one more step. and we'll be
on par with the world's top teams.</i>

321
00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:02.576
{\an8}Soccer fans around the world
can see that happening.

322
00:20:02.659 --> 00:20:04.620
{\an8}That's how much Japan has improved.

323
00:20:04.703 --> 00:20:07.456
{\an8}But to take that extra step. it's time

324
00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:10.083
{\an8}for current Japanese soccer to die.

325
00:20:10.792 --> 00:20:16.548
The dream of simply playing
in the World Cup has served its purpose.

326
00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:20.761
So now is the time to dream
a new dream for Japanese soccer.

327
00:20:20.844 --> 00:20:24.514
Abandon what you've believed
to be common sense until now.

328
00:20:24.598 --> 00:20:27.017
Shove new notions into your brains.

329
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:31.146
<i>What we really need right now
for Japan to become the best in the world</i>

330
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.607
<i>isn't the teamwork of 11 players.</i>

331
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.236
<i>What we need is one hero.</i>

332
00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:41.823
<i>Messi. Cristiano Ronaldo. Neymar...</i>

333
00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:45.911
<i>Soccer can evolve endlessly
if a hero like that exists.</i>

334
00:20:45.994 --> 00:20:49.289
<i>To stop him.
new defensive systems are created.</i>

335
00:20:49.373 --> 00:20:52.626
<i>To top him. new tactics are born.</i>

336
00:20:52.709 --> 00:20:57.214
<i>One person's play can change
a team. a country. even the world.</i>

337
00:20:57.297 --> 00:21:00.008
<i>That's the kind of sports soccer is.</i>

338
00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:03.136
This is a new stage for Japanese soccer.

339
00:21:03.804 --> 00:21:06.348
The main characters are not us adults.
who have forgotten how to dream.

340
00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:09.268
but these youngsters.
who are still nobodies.

341
00:21:09.893 --> 00:21:14.231
Do you have the courage to dream
a new dream of winning the World Cup?

342
00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:17.025
Are you ready to fight?

343
00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:18.443
It's all there...

344
00:21:20.487 --> 00:21:22.781
-In Blue Lock!
-In Blue Lock!

345
00:21:22.864 --> 00:21:24.283
This press conference is over.

346
00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:26.827
What bullshit!

347
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:28.495
Is this how you treat young talent?

348
00:21:28.578 --> 00:21:30.414
JFU's gone crazy!

349
00:21:30.497 --> 00:21:33.834
Sae. we'd better get going.
The flight back to Spain is...

350
00:21:33.917 --> 00:21:35.711
-Cancel it.
-What?

351
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.298
I want to see what kind of idiot's

352
00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:41.800
going to be born
in this country with my own eyes.

353
00:22:17.294 --> 00:22:19.296
Here they come. Team X.

354
00:22:26.553 --> 00:22:28.722
<i>I'll be the one who survives!</i>

355
00:23:15.811 --> 00:23:18.105
<i>A Blue Lock. Additional Time!</i>

356
00:23:19.022 --> 00:23:21.233
{\an8}That's extra training done with.

357
00:23:21.316 --> 00:23:23.985
{\an8}Whew. I'm beat.

358
00:23:25.112 --> 00:23:27.906
Wait. which one was our room again?

359
00:23:27.989 --> 00:23:30.575
If we try every door.
we'll find it eventually.

360
00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:33.203
No. that's the changing room
and bathroom. Bachira.

361
00:23:33.286 --> 00:23:36.289
Huh?

362
00:23:36.373 --> 00:23:39.584
Blue Lock's so huge. it's like a maze.

363
00:23:39.668 --> 00:23:43.338
The map says it's over here...

364
00:23:43.421 --> 00:23:45.966
-It's this way. Bachira.
-Well?

365
00:23:46.049 --> 00:23:47.801
I told you that's the bathroom!

366
00:23:47.884 --> 00:23:52.222
The monster inside me is saying.
"I can't hold it anymore."

367
00:23:52.305 --> 00:23:54.099
Then just go already. idiot!
