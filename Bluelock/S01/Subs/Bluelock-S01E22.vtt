1
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.200
This is bad.

2
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.410
They score one more. it's game over.

3
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.120
Rin's free kick just now...

4
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.460
The moment he got it. 
there was no way to stop him.

5
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.630
So what I needed to read and what I should've
 stopped was the play leading up to it.

6
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.100
N-Nice goal. Rin-kun.

7
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.430
That burst through the middle 
by Tokimitsu and Rin.

8
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.430
High five...

9
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.550
O-Or not?

10
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.560
I anticipated the overall 
decrease in movement.

11
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.150
But Rin likely noticed that Tokimitsu
 hadn't slowed down at all before me.

12
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.900
And by drawing on his endless stamina.

13
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.650
Rin created an extremely effective
 chance in this final phase of the game.

14
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.740
If I'd spotted Tokimitsu's 
talent sooner than Rin.

15
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.530
I could've drawn a different future.

16
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.470
Damn it!

17
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.050
I'm so close. but I can't take 
that final step to catch up to Rin!

18
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.020
Episode 22

19
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.020
Voice

20
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.170
Tch. If I'd been in the wall.

21
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.980
I would've jumped without 
hesitation and blocked it. Damn it.

22
00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:00.490
No. Rin only hit that free kick just over 
my head because it was me in that wall.

23
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.120
If it'd been Barou. I'm certain Rin would've
 gone for the goal a different way. so...

24
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.700
Wait a second.

25
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.340
I see. Rin went with that free kick 
because it was against me.

26
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.010
From that point of view. 
seen from a new perspective.

27
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.010
if I can find a way to use
 "Isagi Yoichi" effectively...

28
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.010
I can devour.

29
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.310
Could this be the new formula
 I need to beat Rin?

30
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.000
Any more errors and we're done for.

31
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.440
So gimme the ball. okay?

32
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.810
Step back. missy.

33
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.360
All of you! Even if your leg falls off. 
just pass it to me at the end of it.

34
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.620
I don't care how we do it. 
but we're gonna catch up.

35
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.820
Yo. Let's go. striker.

36
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.250
Yeah. It's way too early for our last play.

37
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.960
Oh jeez. he's coming.

38
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.050
Stop talking like a toddler.

39
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.550
Isagi? It's rare for him to keep up
 with my movement like this.

40
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.820
Okay then. donkey!

41
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.350
That was you telling me 
to get past this guy. right?

42
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.810
I got past him! Gimme it now!

43
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.600
I'm so sorry. but you didn't get past me!

44
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.610
Jeez. back off! Stop following me if you're 
just gonna apologize. you neurotic machine.

45
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:20.990
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

46
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.070
But I have to win!

47
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.780
Man. you're so damn annoying!

48
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.150
Ah. you're terrifying! 
But I can keep up. no problem.

49
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.560
Is he sneaking down the touch-line?

50
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.980
Isagi. you bastard. Did you use me as a decoy?

51
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.380
Nice recovery. Bachira-kun.

52
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.420
Wait for me. Isagi.

53
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.180
Please don't leave me behind.

54
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.180
Give it to me. Isagi. 
Your dribbling won't work in that situation!

55
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.260
Isagi. over here.

56
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.600
Play a one-two!

57
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.690
No. Rin can see through all of those 
options and will be ready for us.

58
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.520
But this cluster of players was my aim!

59
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.070
Everyone's focused on how
 I'm gonna pass right now.

60
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.610
so this attack will change 
the battlefield completely!

61
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.070
Now. into that wide open space...

62
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.220
Run. Chigiri!

63
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.660
Full speed ahead!

64
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.000
Aren't you running on empty yet. miss?

65
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:19.140
And because we want Chigiri to pass to us. 
we all rush toward the goalmouth.

66
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.300
I'm the only one who can read this change
 in the state of play and initiate a move.

67
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.720
With everyone fighting to find a path.

68
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.550
I disappear completely from Rin's 
vision for a second and make my move.

69
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.020
A diagonal run to the near post!

70
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.980
Only Isagi's running diagonally?

71
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.900
Pass it now. This is...

72
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.570
the future of the field I drew!

73
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.280
Here it comes! I'm completely
 free! It's a huge chance!

74
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.540
My absolute territory for a direct shot!

75
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.700
Rin?

76
00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.160
Shit. Are you serious?

77
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.790
I was through. yet he somehow
 caught up. even if only barely.

78
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.730
He's gonna block my shot.

79
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.140
It's no good.

80
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.340
I'm not good enough...

81
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.260
to beat this guy.

82
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:15.230
Not.

83
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.520
I fooled you. genius!

84
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.190
This momentary blind spot was only
 created because you can read me

85
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.030
and catch up to me with your genius!

86
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.530
And this is my true last action!

87
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.040
My reverse direct back-heel shot!

88
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.840
You truly are a savior.

89
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.800
Isagi...

90
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.880
I devoured you. Rin.

91
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.940
I will surpass you.

92
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.670
Eat it!

93
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.520
We caught up! You're the best. Isagi!

94
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.150
That was crazy. You outran Rin by yourself.

95
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.900
Was all of that calculated based 
on what you could see. Isagi?

96
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:12.420
Yeah. But what came into my mind first was 
the image of me getting free and scoring.

97
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:17.090
Normally. just getting to the near post in 
that move would've been enough to score.

98
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:23.420
But I assumed Rin would spot that 
with those genius eyes and mind of his.

99
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.910
Meaning if I'd taken the shot.
 he would've blocked it.

100
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:31.510
But that also meant he had to step 
across in front of me to stop me.

101
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.640
which made both of our actions fifty-fifty.

102
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.340
That momentary blind spot was
 the future of the field I wanted.

103
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:43.650
That goal was only made possible 
due to my exclusive formula for Itoshi Rin.

104
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:48.940
where I believed in his ability to 
envision the same scene I had foreseen!

105
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.480
Which means. if you'd missed. 
they could've counterattacked.

106
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.780
Your gamble could've cost us.

107
00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:00.750
No one comes up with stuff like that 
unless they have the same vision as Rin.

108
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:06.210
But now. we're even with them on 
the field and the scoreline. right?

109
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:14.380
Yeah. We'll crush 'em on this last play 
and prove that we're the better team.

110
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.470
We're still tied. If we don't win...

111
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.060
If we don't trounce them. 
it's all meaningless.

112
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:31.970
What bit of ego am I missing that
 I need to catch up to Isagi and Rin?

113
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:41.430
I came to Blue Lock to find monsters... 
Friends I can play soccer with.

114
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.010
There's no other reason.

115
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.890
I just want to play soccer with these two.

116
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:56.830
But this wish. this ego. isn't enough
 to get me to where they are.

117
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.490
What else am I supposed to wish for?

118
00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.980
What in the world was that glam 
back-heel just now? They caught up to us.

119
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:16.490
Laugh. cry. or be glam... 
Whoever scores next wins.

120
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:21.330
All of you. put everything you have into
this next move like your life depends on it.

121
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.880
I'll draw you a goal with your efforts.

122
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.900
Blue Lock 
2nd Selection

123
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.510
4v4 Rivalry Battle

124
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.510
Last Play

125
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.260
Not so fast!

126
00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.470
I won't fall for the same trick twice!

127
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.070
Nice. Barou! Focus on pressing Tokimitsu!

128
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.020
Eek! The girly-looking one who's
 all speed and no skill is here. too!

129
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.810
So that's how you see me. huh?

130
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.270
I'm gonna bury you!

131
00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:57.240
Chigiri and Barou's pressing stops 
Rin and Tokimitsu bursting up the middle.

132
00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.320
Surprised by that. he returns it to Rin.

133
00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.780
And that's when we intercept!

134
00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:03.490
It's a fifty-fifty!

135
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.710
Damn! Almost.

136
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.210
A high ball? Is it meant for Aryu?

137
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.170
A first-touch showdown.

138
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.050
I'll lose if I go for it at its highest 
point. so I'll time my jump...

139
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.090
to pluck it out of the air!

140
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.890
How insolent. But also...

141
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.600
Totally lousy.

142
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.270
He stole it back?

143
00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.030
His legs are so long.

144
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.520
Is he a damn stick insect?

145
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.400
Crap. They're breaking through!

146
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.230
But I won't let him play freely!

147
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.590
Isagi Yoichi. you are 
perfectly obstructing me.

148
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:39.610
But this one's wide open.

149
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.630
I'm being tested right now.

150
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.010
What can I do?

151
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.580
Pass it? No. dribble through them...

152
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.730
But then what?

153
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.340
What does everyone want from me?

154
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:58.550
Tell me. my monster.

155
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.570
What am I supposed to do?

156
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.410
What can I do...

157
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.520
to make those two acknowledge me?

158
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.230
Nice one. slowpoke!

159
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.980
If all you can do is worry.
 go to a fortune teller.

160
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.610
This is a battlefield!

161
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.190
Second ball...

162
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.980
Jackal!

163
00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:18.780
Urk!

164
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:19.440
Counter!

165
00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:22.380
This isn't like you.

166
00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.770
Are you losing on purpose?

167
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:31.000
I mean. you're not saying to yourself that 
even if you lose. you'll get chosen. are you?

168
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:34.720
Honestly. if you asked me. I'd say 
I don't need you in your current state.

169
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.410
If we win. I want Rin.

170
00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.430
Isagi probably feels the same way.

171
00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.710
If we lose. I don't get chosen?

172
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:54.110
Then I won't be able to 
play soccer with Isagi or Rin.

173
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.050
No...

174
00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.020
No. no. no!

175
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.150
I don't want that...

176
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:03.700
to happen!

177
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.870
Pass it. Barou! Don't try 
to tussle with Tokimitsu!

178
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:11.830
Hmph! I'm fed up with Glum Guns here.

179
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.620
Give it back to me with interest. y'hear?

180
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.420
Nice pass. Bullet payment!

181
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.420
That's how you wanna play this. donkey?

182
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:20.850
You ready. King?

183
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:24.210
Because we've been stealing 
the ball from each other all game.

184
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:28.180
we can link up now and outsmart Rin's 
foresight and Tokimitsu's quickness.

185
00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.140
One more time!

186
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.220
An anti-combo. one-two breakaway!

187
00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.850
Oh no! Come back!

188
00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:34.350
This is a seesaw game.

189
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.230
All right! We're through!

190
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.320
We'll nail the last play.

191
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.610
No... I don't want to get left behind.

192
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.040
My feelings. my ego... None of that matters.

193
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.160
I'll win. even if it kills me!

194
00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:57.200
Everything I've found here in Blue Lock...

195
00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.090
I don't want to lose any of it!

196
00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.770
I don't want to lose the 
first friends I found.

197
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:12.190
Because I don't want to go back 
to being alone like I was before...

198
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:26.860
Everyone wants to believe in something. but as 
they grow older. they find they can't anymore.

199
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.670
So they pretend they 
can't hear the voice inside.

200
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.700
until eventually. they can 
no longer hear what it's saying.

201
00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:37.920
What you're trying to believe in
 is so fleeting yet important.

202
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.420
What I'm trying to believe in?

203
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:45.380
What am I trying to believe in?

204
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:48.860
What have I believed in?

205
00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:54.500
Monsters?

206
00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:57.050
Friends?

207
00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:00.310
Meguru. the answer is...

208
00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.690
It is your true inner voice.

209
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.160
My true inner voice?

210
00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.690
Remember it once more.

211
00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.510
I want to trust...

212
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.260
my true inner voice!

213
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.220
Unexpected pressing by Bachira!

214
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.640
Rin will use this opening.

215
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.980
There! Get there one step faster and
 pass it to Chigiri on the right wing.

216
00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.810
And now. time for the climax.

217
00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.280
Wait. Hold on a minute.

218
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.240
I don't want this to end yet.

219
00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.320
I won't let you shoot!

220
00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.860
I'm winning that Best 
Supporting Actor award.

221
00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:51.950
A chest pass?!

222
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.160
It's all yours...

223
00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.150
striker.

224
00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.000
You're the absolute best.

225
00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.370
Here comes the target for my shot.

226
00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:01.830
It's not huge. but I can score it!

227
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:04.060
Wait for me. Isagi.

228
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.620
One more time...

229
00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:06.880
This is the end!

230
00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:08.670
Just give me one more...

231
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.590
The victory is ours!

232
00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.720
Give me one more chance!

233
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:25.860
Rin? Seriously. how'd you...

234
00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:42.790
And Bachira Meguru starts to advance. 
with only his voice guiding the way.

235
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.500
Unrefined but glam. Rin.

236
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.240
C-Counter!

237
00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.890
Stop. Don't come out now. monster.

238
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:52.470
When you're on the field.

239
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.810
I unconsciously look for you.

240
00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.940
Because you were there. I wasn't alone.

241
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:05.370
Thanks to you. I could 
keep on trusting myself.

242
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:12.110
But while I was looking for you. 
I lost touch with my own voice.

243
00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:16.160
and started playing 
soccer to find someone.

244
00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:20.410
That's why I can't go any further with you.

245
00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:23.460
Disappear.

246
00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.220
I'm begging you. Please disappear.

247
00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.560
I don't need you anymore.

248
00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.840
If I let anyone past me. 
it's game over. This is my last stand!

249
00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.670
If only someone were there. 
I could get in behind Isagi.

250
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:42.430
Damn it.

251
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:46.650
It's so hard to shake my habit
 of looking for the "monster."

252
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:51.690
You used to be my hope 
because you played soccer with me.

253
00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:57.570
But I somehow turned you into 
a curse that stifles my vision.

254
00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:02.080
Playing soccer with you gradually 
became my purpose for living.

255
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:10.270
Then I came to Blue Lock and met Isagi.
 who became my true monster.

256
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.670
It felt so good. playing soccer 
with Isagi became my reason to exist.

257
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.600
I became someone who couldn't 
play soccer without Isagi.

258
00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:24.210
If I don't break this curse. 
I can't move forward.

259
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.600
I won't be able to hear my own voice.

260
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.310
Bachira-kun! I'm open here! Pass it now!

261
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:30.970
Shut up. Go away!

262
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.070
I won't pass the ball to you anymore.

263
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.650
I'll go score myself!

264
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:39.240
A super-aggressive nutmeg? 
What is this wild dribbling style?

265
00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.990
Plus. I've never seen Bachira 
look like that before.

266
00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.810
Something's changed.

267
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.960
He's not who he used to be!

268
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.040
Stop him. Chigiri! You can reach him!

269
00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.330
He's so slow. it's a piece of cake! 
I won't let him past me!

270
00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:53.460
Bachira!

271
00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.630
I'm overlapping.

272
00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.630
I told you I'm not passing anymore.

273
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:00.640
A double nutmeg?

274
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:03.230
You in rampage mode. Blunt Bangs?

275
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.230
They'll get it if you don't pass. Bachira-kun.

276
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:08.380
Shut up. This isn't a rampage.

277
00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.560
It's an awakening to break the curse!

278
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.030
A triple nutmeg?

279
00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:16.690
Damn it.

280
00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:19.660
His moves are so on point. 
At this rate. he'll beat us.

281
00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:25.370
Right now. there's no doubt he's the joker
 in the deck no one on this field can anticipate!

282
00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.230
He's on a solo run. We all need to charge him!

283
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.830
Agreed.

284
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:29.620
Surround him!

285
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:34.840
We have him in a three-on-one. 
This works! We can take the ball!

286
00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.220
Rin? His positioning...

287
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.410
It's easy for Bachira to pass to him there.

288
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:44.390
and when he receives the ball.
 he has a direct route to goal!

289
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.490
But I can see that. too!

290
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:48.360
I will intercept the pass!

291
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.960
Their half's wide open!

292
00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.560
The price of his rampage!

293
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.960
So if we can get the ball. 
it's a big chance for us.

294
00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:59.820
All you pests hovering around me
 like tiny little insects...

295
00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.200
Stop distracting me. you pieces of shit!

296
00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:05.910
That's reckless. Bachira-kun!

297
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.870
He still plans to go it in alone?

298
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.790
I see.

299
00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:12.410
Someone Rin can't predict.

300
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:16.030
The last piece of all-or-nothing...

301
00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:19.840
That monster is the one
I need to devour to beat Rin!

302
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.340
How long has it been?

303
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:27.600
I'd forgotten how to play with freedom. 
but this was my starting point.

304
00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:30.600
You should try to be one with the ball. too.

305
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.690
'Cause then you can do amazing stuff!

306
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.570
There's nothing more fun than soccer!

307
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:37.920
That's right.

308
00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.030
Even alone. I had so much fun.

309
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.160
I ran around after the ball till it got dark.

310
00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:47.310
Just like it was back then.

311
00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.460
being one with the ball 
is all there is for me.

312
00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:53.920
I don't need any other reason to play soccer.

313
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:59.640
There's nothing more fun 
than this in the whole universe!

314
00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.550
So even if I get teased for being strange...

315
00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.800
Even if I end up alone again...

316
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.390
Even if I don't have any friends...

317
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:10.270
I'll fight.

318
00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:14.490
I'll lose myself in this 
passion that burns inside me!

319
00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:17.360
Oh no you don't!

320
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:20.530
You're not it.

321
00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:24.360
I'm going to be the monster!

322
00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:28.910
Thank you for staying by my side until now.

323
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:33.540
I'll be sad if there's no one 
else at the end of all this.

324
00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:40.180
but from now on. 
I'm going to be dancing alone.

325
00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.380
Goodbye. monster.

326
00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:49.210
Goodbye. Isagi. the guy who's 
been my soccer buddy up to now.

327
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.730
Crap. I can't stop him.

328
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:59.850
I have to get back my solitary soccer!

329
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.300
That is what will awaken me...

330
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.010
This "back to square one" ego!

331
00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:22.670
Isagi?

332
00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:25.160
I knew you'd do that. Bachira.

333
00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.860
I just knew you'd go it alone.

355
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:16.080
Everything under the sun can be 
categorized as either "glam" or "not glam."

356
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.050
For example. even how you
 drink a beverage can be glam.

357
00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:22.460
I must always be glam when 
flicking off the cap on a bottle—

That post-drink. sexy-glance glam!

380
00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:33.180
This guy... Is it possible 
he's even more glam than me?

381
00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.350
Every move he makes is bursting with glam.

382
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:37.310
POOF

383
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:38.390
POOF

384
00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.270
You let your guard down. Itoshi Rin!
That sitting posture is so not glam!

385
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:45.110
Behold! My elegant 
getting-into-bed glam cannon!

386
