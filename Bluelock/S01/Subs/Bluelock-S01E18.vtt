1
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.940
How?

2
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.450
How have I been brought to my knees
 without even scoring once?

3
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.180
I'm supposed to be the king of the field.

4
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.180
I... used to play the lead on the field.

5
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.720
Y-You're amazing. Barou-kun.

6
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.980
I had talent.

7
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.310
I'm so happy you're on my team!

8
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.140
Everyone else was in a supporting role.

9
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.530
You all need to move so I can score.

10
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.820
Sure thing!

11
00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.370
We're invincible now!

12
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.140
They're happy even though 
they're just the supporting cast.

13
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.680
Why do they even play soccer?

14
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.830
I am the king.

15
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.300
I gave up trying to understand others.
and pursued my own style of soccer.

16
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:26.140
Then. it hit me. I didn't like soccer 
because I got to feel like a king.

17
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.730
And it obviously wasn't because 
I loved kicking a ball around.

18
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.760
I liked it because I could grab someone 
who'd dedicated their whole life to soccer

19
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.110
and drag them off the stage and
 out of the spotlight with my goals.

20
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.340
I found myself playing 
to taste that exhilaration.

21
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.880
I know. more than anyone...

22
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.840
that it's a feeling of incomparable joy.

23
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.660
only available to the truly strong.

24
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.440
If they score next. we lose. Isagi.

25
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.490
It's our ball. Let's go get one.

26
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.450
Yeah. let's start our comeback here—

27
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.160
Go on!

28
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.500
For real?!

29
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.290
A direct shot?

30
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.080
Ah. damn it!

31
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.830
Kunigami. the loose ball!

32
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:54.920
Right!

33
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.130
Let's go. Reo! Time for a swift counter—

34
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.230
Just you try it. Kunigami Gains-kun.

35
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.340
Man. he was on me fast!

36
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.730
Over here. Kunigami! 
We can't lose it so close to the goal!

37
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.180
Nice. Reo. All yours!

38
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:11.820
What?

39
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.980
He read my movement?

40
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.730
I won't...

41
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.440
let you have it all your own way!

42
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.610
Loose ball.

43
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.110
It's finally here.

44
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.180
My big chance to become the lead.

45
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.960
The ideal zone for my shot is wide open.

46
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.580
If I eat up the last few meters
 with my first touch.

47
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.380
I can hit a precise shot toward goal!

48
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.010
You're one step short. King.

49
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.470
I'm faster.

50
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.970
Bastard.

51
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.930
If I take a touch. he'll catch up to me!

52
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.890
Damn. damn. damn!

53
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.350
What do I do? Do I shoot 
even though I'm not in range?

54
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.060
Damn it!

55
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.060
My ideal zone is right there!

56
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.290
I'm one step...

57
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.890
too short.

58
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.120
Give me the ball.

59
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.640
That was a nice pass. donkey.

60
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.410
You need to move so I can score.

61
00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.610
What is this feeling?

62
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.760
This despair that's gripping my heart?

63
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.260
Is it defeat?

64
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.100
I didn't make that pass myself.

65
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.480
It was forced out of me.

66
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:26.010
In that moment. I lost to Isagi Yoichi.

67
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.600
Don't stand in my way.

68
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:32.240
Or I'll kill you.

69
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.940
You have no talent.

70
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.090
Do you want the king to 
personally crush you?

71
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.740
Go back to sleep. average Joe.

72
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.540
I'll decide what I do.

73
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.630
I'd rather die than play for someone else.

74
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.780
You all need to move so I can score.

75
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.390
In that moment. he was the lead.

76
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.030
and soccer didn't exist to serve me.

77
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.950
I wasn't a king at all.

78
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.910
Isagi's unstoppable right now.

79
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.370
The next play will be the last.

80
00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.130
Keep Isagi from getting
 the ball at all costs.

81
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.370
Right. I don't think 
we can stop him if he gets it.

82
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.950
It's our ball at the restart. 
so we'll kick off the last play.

83
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.610
We will score the next goal and win.

84
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.340
If they take the ball from us. we lose.

85
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.910
In that case. let's use my speed.

86
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.680
Right now. that route gives us 
the best possibility of scoring.

87
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.770
Okay. that's the general plan. then.

88
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:42.730
If we want to bet everything on 
the last shot. it's our best option.

89
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.100
We will win this.

90
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.110
Yeah.

91
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.210
It's all I'm here for.

92
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.250
It's their ball at the restart.

93
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.490
Before anything else.
 we have to get the ball.

94
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:56.730
Yup.

95
00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.160
But we gotta watch out for Chigiri.

96
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.920
Even if we mark him. 
he can outrun us in a foot race.

97
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.590
And if he controls it like he did earlier.
 his speed won't drop at all.

98
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.840
If we start our sprints at the same time.
 there's no way we can beat him.

99
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.550
In that case...

100
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.300
We have to stop him before that.

101
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.640
You have a plan?

102
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.410
Yeah. I'll stick on Reo and—

103
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.150
Wait. hold on.

104
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.520
Do we want to share this with him?

105
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:31.530
It's easier to defend with three of us. 
and if we concede next. we're done.

106
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:35.220
It's pointless saying anything
 to a dethroned king.

107
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.760
You and I will decide how 
this last play turns out.

108
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.100
All right.

109
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.880
Their defense is focused on 
blocking the route to Chigiri?

110
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.260
While the route to Kunigami
 is pretty much wide open?

111
00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.310
Which means they don't care
 if I pass it that way.

112
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.390
Damn. I want to use Chigiri's speed.

113
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.600
Dribble

114
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.600
Dribble

115
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.590
but like this. any pass to him 
will put him at a disadvantage.

116
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.600
Pass

117
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.600
Pass

118
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.600
Disadvantage

119
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.600
Disadvantage

120
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:10.250
And Nagi is laser-focused
 on marking Chigiri.

121
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.940
They've seen through our tactic completely.

122
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:14.530
Kunigami!

123
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.000
So I'm not a threat. huh?

124
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.450
But what do we do?

125
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.700
Any less-than-perfect pass is too risky.

126
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.870
Should I try beating Barou?

127
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.330
No. that's also way too risky.

128
00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:26.740
Reo. go again!

129
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.870
It won't work. Kunigami and I
 can't go on the attack here.

130
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:32.460
No. What the hell am I thinking?

131
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.090
I'm gonna beat this guy!

132
00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:35.880
I will force open...

133
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.300
the route to Chigiri!

134
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.550
Not yet.

135
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.070
Draw him in.

136
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:43.430
I don't need to get past him.

137
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.730
A clear path is all I need.

138
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:47.440
One moment will do!

139
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:50.440
I see it!

140
00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.780
Run!

141
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.230
Okay!

142
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:59.240
I win. Isagi Yoichi!

143
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.950
Leave it all to me!

144
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:04.870
This guy...

145
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.580
Where's he going?

146
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.580
He's charging down my pass.
 Surely he's not...

147
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:17.890
Knowing he can't beat Chigiri for speed.
 he's trying to... intercept my pass himself?

148
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.260
Nice pass. Reo.

149
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.510
That's what we were waiting for.

150
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.380
Huh? You're kidding.

151
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.150
This whole situation was part of his plan?

152
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.860
If he doesn't get a touch on the ball. 
Chigiri will get it and it's game over.

153
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:36.820
Reach it.

154
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:46.090
They've taken such a huge gamble 
in the last minutes of the match?

155
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.000
Aw. man. That was super close.

156
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:50.750
L-Loose ball!

157
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.230
Let's go. donkey.

158
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.140
Bring it. King!

159
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.450
Once I'd accepted this thing called defeat.

160
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:13.220
it became crystal clear to me 
that this field is shining for his goals.

161
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.880
Strangely. I'm fine with it.

162
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.290
Maybe because I'm no longer the lead.

163
00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:21.860
This way!

164
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.700
I'm here. too!

165
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:25.110
This guy...

166
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:26.870
Hold up. you bastard!

167
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.150
I won't let you have it 
all your own way. genius!

168
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.750
You again. Meddling Missy?

169
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.400
I've never felt like this before.

170
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.760
They're taunting me with 
all these routes to scoring.

171
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.970
And showing me that. in my supporting role.
 I can make a pass and we can win.

172
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.900
I can be a vital piece in our next goal.

173
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:52.730
You two are shining too damn bright for me.

174
00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.980
Damn. So that's what it was about.

175
00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:01.470
All of the supporting cast who 
have fed me passes up to now...

176
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.890
This is how they felt.

177
00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:10.090
This sense of defeat 
can only be salvaged...

178
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.860
by entrusting the goal 
to the supreme strikers!

179
00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.750
We can win with my pass.

180
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.080
So this is what being a "team" means.

181
00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.780
This is how I create a 
chemical reaction with them.

182
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:28.760
For the defeated man in the supporting role. 
this is his reason for existing.

183
00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:34.940
What's this?

184
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.080
What's going on?

185
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:39.820
What's clinging to me?

186
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:43.690
Is this the future that 
awaits me after this pass?

187
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:45.810
I see.

188
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:47.870
Entrusting the goal to them...

189
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:54.020
might indeed salvage me 
from this sense of defeat.

190
00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:58.740
But that's just escapism for 
those with broken dreams

191
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.620
who can't bear to deny
 the lives they've led so far.

192
00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:08.300
That's right. It's nothing
 but a loser's excuse.

193
00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.970
I refuse...

194
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:17.610
to live in a future...

195
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:20.990
like that!

196
00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.240
A chop feint?!

197
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.360
And acute-angle dribbling?!

198
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.200
The path I need to see is...

199
00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:29.410
Barou!

200
00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:30.810
Didn't know he could do that.

201
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.500
Tch. This is bad.

202
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.750
If he passes to Isagi. we're done for.

203
00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.070
Which way?

204
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.880
Is he looking to dribble past me?

205
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.800
No. that motion can only be a pass!

206
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.740
What? Consecutive chops?

207
00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:49.170
He used Isagi as a decoy?

208
00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:52.600
A lightning dribble with cutbacks 
that don't lessen the power of his run!

209
00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:54.810
Is this guy for real?

210
00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.840
He's evolving at this point in the match?!

211
00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:01.730
Go to him. Chigiri! 
Barou's not gonna pass now!

212
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:05.070
I can see it! I can feel it!

213
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.030
Now that I know defeat. 
what I need to see is...

214
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:11.590
not some legitimate route that
 entrusts the goal to the lead.

215
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:15.750
but the route that only 
exists for my goal. This...

216
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:17.830
twisted path!

217
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.670
He used Isagi to disguise his next move?

218
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.300
Hidden behind the light
 you're throwing out...

219
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.670
Now it's time for me to devour you!

220
00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:34.220
These guys are devouring each other!

221
00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.660
This is Barou's awakening.

222
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.290
Devouring each other to get ahead...

223
00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.370
This is our chemical reaction!

224
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:46.480
Wow. is he gonna pass them all?

225
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.410
I won't be reduced to a supporting role.

226
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.280
Move!

227
00:14:52.830 --> 00:15:00.260
If you're the lead. I'm more than happy 
to play the villain who devours your light!

228
00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.080
Holy hell. dude.

229
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.960
Welcome back. King.

230
00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:18.450
This twisted path is my new kingly way.

231
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.030
I am...

232
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.970
the king!

233
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.940
Episode 18

234
00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.940
The Stage for the Lead

235
00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.330
Final score: 4-5.

236
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:41.620
Blue Lock Second Selection. 
Third Stage: 3v3 Rivalry Battle.

237
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:43.330
Barou!

238
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:47.710
Team White are the winners.

239
00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.920
Isagi Yoichi.

240
00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.380
Oh. High five denied.

241
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.380
Nagi Seishiro.

242
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.460
Barou Shouei.

243
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.420
First of all...

244
00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:58.640
Take it back.

245
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.140
Am I a "donkey"?

246
00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.670
Sorry. I was wrong.

247
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.860
You're seriously amazing. man!

248
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:13.490
Tch. Being around you
 throws me off my game.

249
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:15.070
Nice shot.

250
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.990
Victory! We won.

251
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.040
Hey. Nagi. you're...

252
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.160
Get off me. bastard.

253
00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.580
Seriously though. 
those chops were awesome.

254
00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.290
Why didn't you say you could do that?

255
00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:30.370
Can it.

256
00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.300
It just came to me.

257
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.630
How?

258
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.470
Tell me more about yourself.

259
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:44.440
I always thought the field 
belonged to me and me alone.

260
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:48.030
It was me versus all the rest.

261
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:54.990
But you two were the first ones 
to steal the lead role away from me.

262
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:58.280
So in order to survive in Blue Lock.

263
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:02.040
I found a way to dominate 
the field as the villain.

264
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.380
That's all there is to it.

265
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:08.340
Well. the other team was pretty strong.

266
00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.460
If they'd been mediocre. 
you wouldn't have felt that way.

267
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.670
I guess you're right there.

268
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:21.450
So that's how this new "chop dribbling"
 weapon of yours was born. huh?

269
00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:25.520
Yup. You really are amazing.

270
00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.720
Whatever.

271
00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:34.740
Villain or not. my dream is to become the 
world's best striker as the king of the field.

272
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:41.280
I won't lose to you ever again. Isagi.

273
00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:47.900
Hey. you just called Isagi 
by his actual name for once.

274
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.210
Huh? Oh.

275
00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.690
As if anyone's keeping track.

276
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.670
You're a real pain in the ass. Mr. Hassle Man.

277
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:57.510
I'm not Mr. Hassle Man. I'm Nagi.
 Call me by my name. too.

278
00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.970
Can it. you pest.

279
00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:03.670
Hey now. That's rude.

280
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:06.640
Nagi.

281
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.770
Nice game.

282
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:11.780
Yup.

283
00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:16.150
Isagi\h\h\hNagi\h\h\hBarou

284
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.150
.

285
00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.150
.

286
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.110
Incredible.

287
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.970
Using those chops. 
he dribbled past three players.

288
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:24.630
and fired a shot of unmatched 
accuracy into the top-right corner.

289
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:28.960
Looking purely at technique. 
he's one of the top talents in Japan.

290
00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.870
Barou Shouei-kun.

291
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.300
Japan Football Union
BL Supervisor

292
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.300
Was his awakening in your 
calculation. Ego-san?

293
00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.510
Nope. not at all. 
That was all his own talent's doing.

294
00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.510
Blue Lock Project
Representative

295
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:38.550
Huh?

296
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.080
Listen. Anri-chan.

297
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:45.300
Defeat is a simple phenomenon that 
must exist in the world of competition.

298
00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:50.520
Even for the world's best striker. 
it's impossible to win every single match.

299
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:55.320
What matters is what 
you take from the defeat.

300
00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:59.350
A loser is denied by the 
field they're playing on.

301
00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:03.030
For a fighter. there is nothing 
worse than that despair.

302
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:09.500
And yet. many average Joes don't carve this 
despair into their minds. That's important.

303
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:13.210
Denied for their powerlessness
 and lack of talent.

304
00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:18.280
they're afraid to acknowledge their mistakes 
and unconsciously make excuses.

305
00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.300
fantastically unaware they're doing so.

306
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.310
No. this is just the beginning.

307
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:27.640
That's right! There is 
no "game over" in life!

308
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:30.590
In order to not feel like 
it's all been a waste.

309
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:34.080
they trick themselves into thinking 
not giving up is the right answer.

310
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.870
I call it "dream doping."

311
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:43.950
Live street
 performance! 
15th Anniversary

312
00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:43.950
Their goal used to be achieving their dream.
but now their goal is the act of chasing after it.

313
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:48.660
I have zero interest in the garbage 
who continue to fool themselves

314
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.740
by clinging onto the ghost of a dream.

315
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:55.420
If you don't live your life to 
achieve your dream. it's pointless.

316
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:59.510
That's why defeat is the
crossroads for your dream.

317
00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:05.220
What's needed is the strength to fully 
realize your powerlessness in that moment.

318
00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.840
The ability to feel despair.

319
00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:16.520
There's a path you can only see once you've 
given up on the path to your dream.

320
00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.740
And that path leads to your new potential.

321
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.740
Those who continue to fight 
in spite of their despair

322
00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.620
are bestowed with the power
 to achieve their dream.
