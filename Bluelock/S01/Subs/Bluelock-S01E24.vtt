WEBVTT

1
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.850
Not bad. guys.

2
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.670
Keep on being decoys for me.

3
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.380
What gives. Rin-chan? Now that Isagi's on 
the team. your movement's on a whole other level.

4
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.220
That goal just now...

5
00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.980
It was inspired by my off-the-ball movement 
as I tried to devour the image in Bachira's head.

6
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.240
I made a run that was awkward for
 the opposition. and Rin fed off that.

7
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.140
Th-Those three are seriously amazing.

8
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.090
They scored straight away
against the World Five...

9
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.070
The chemistry between Isagi and Bachira
drives them forward. and Rin devours it.

10
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.850
Our last match opened up
 this avenue of attack to them.

11
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.810
and it even works against 
the world's top players.

12
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.210
Wow. that's so cool.

13
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.000
Yeah. What a noble triangle they have formed.

14
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.970
Fabulously glam.

15
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.560
Add me in and we'll make it a square.

16
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.230
Huh?

17
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.420
Hey. I want in! Let's make it a pentagon!

18
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.010
If you wanna join in. have at it.

19
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.720
Okay. let's see how far we can go.

20
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.930
I told you. we're gonna win.

21
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.690
Sure. that goal worked. 
but it wasn't my goal.

22
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.530
Next time. I'll be the one to score!

23
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.200
Bring it. Mister "I'm 17 and
 I already play for France"!

24
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.120
He's looking for someone to pass to?

25
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.450
Um. is this okay?

26
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.080
Julian Loki
France International

27
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.160
At this distance.

28
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.080
you've got nothing but weak spots.

29
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.500
He's coming! His first touch...

30
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.940
Huh?!

31
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.130
He's super fast!

32
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.090
What's with his explosive acceleration?!

33
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.760
Bachira!

34
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.100
Once in top gear. he doesn't slow at all.
 and his strides while dribbling are huge!

35
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.230
Oh no! He eats up so much
 ground with each touch!

36
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.480
He's past you before you can even react.

37
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.560
Your route is too obvious.

38
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.120
You've got good foresight.

39
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.860
But I'm fast.

40
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.130
He...

41
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.260
He went up another gear?

42
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.490
So this is the speed of 
Loki the Child Prodigy?

43
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.990
This is the World Five!

44
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.700
Come on. Loki. Don't do it all yourself.

45
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.540
Pass it next time. you jerk!

46
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.670
Okay.

47
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.920
I've had enough. anyway.

48
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.510
Let's finish this up and hit the showers.

49
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.720
Do we even stand a chance?

50
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.930
Like a sprinter.

51
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.890
Unbelievable speed.

52
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.100
Stop whining and just give me the ball.

53
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.480
Are you...

54
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.940
that scared of Loki's speed?

55
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.090
You've just got tunnel vision from a lack of experience.

56
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.860
Take it away...

57
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:24.660
baby.

58
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.700
All righty.

59
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.290
We'll stop him. Bachira! 
The two of us can box him in.

60
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.120
Gotcha.

61
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.250
Ka-zoom.

62
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.930
Pablo Cabassos
Argentina International

63
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.760
He pinged a pacy pass 
with backspin between us?!

64
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.340
So this is where you were aiming.
 I will win this aerial battle.

65
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.050
Dada Silva
Brazil International

66
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.050
You're goin' down!

67
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.600
Aryu doesn't have free rein in the air?

68
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.570
Oh no! Not in front of the goal!

69
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.060
But I can reach it! I'll clear it!

70
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.120
Move.

71
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.150
Adam Blake
England International

72
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.150
I've got no interest in male bodies.

73
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.090
Tokimitsu got outmuscled?

74
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.410
It's no good. Speed. anticipation.
 kicking. jumping. physical strength...

75
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.720
Every single one of our 
weapons is being overpowered.

76
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.980
Everything we've been doing in 
Blue Lock up to now isn't working!

77
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.230
Here are some players we can 
never beat as we are now.

78
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.190
This is how far away 
we still are from the very top.

79
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.960
This is the level I'm aiming to reach?

80
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.480
Soccer is amazing.

81
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.830
I want to get to that level.

82
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.970
Not yet.

83
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.530
No. we're not done yet!

84
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.910
Rin.

85
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:56.890
I like you.

86
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.620
Leonardo Luna

87
00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.620
As expected of Sae's brother.

88
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.620
Spain International

89
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.500
Unlike these other kids.

90
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.020
you really still think you can win this.

91
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.510
I'm gonna discourage...

92
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.720
you.

93
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.270
That's no good.

94
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.360
If you open your legs that easily.

95
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.350
people are gonna think you're a loose guy.

96
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.470
Don't be depressed.

97
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.370
This is just an assessment.

98
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.580
There's no way you coulda won!

99
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.290
Time to report to Ego about your skills.

100
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.140
Adiós. you lumps of talent.

101
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.250
Let's meet again on the real field.

102
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.130
Blue Lock 
3rd Selection

103
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.550
1st Assignment: 
Match Against the World Five

104
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.930
Rin...

105
00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.300
Damn it.

106
00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.200
Lose

107
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:09.410
Blue Lock

108
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:09.410
Special

109
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:09.410
Conference Room

110
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.850
You're paying these world-class 
players a hundred million each?

111
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.400
Plus a goal bonus of one million on top?!

112
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.690
Just how much money are you 
wasting on this stupid project?!

113
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.800
Exactly! And what's the 
point of it? Explain yourself!

114
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.370
And sit properly!

115
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.630
"Spare the rod and spoil the child."

116
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.340
Our aim is to give these youths
 a taste of the real world.

117
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.340
Blue Lock Project
Representative

118
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.230
I don't expect a bunch of old geezers 
who've learned how to give up

119
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.630
to understand what 
it means to dream. so zip it.

120
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.410
What?! How impudent!

121
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.100
All right. all right. That's enough. Ego-kun.

122
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.560
As of right now. 
the Blue Lock project is canceled.

123
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.570
Japan Football Union
Special Adviser

124
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.110
B-But that's so sudden! Why?

125
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.060
Complaints from parents.

126
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.560
An unclear picture of the project's aim.

127
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.320
And more importantly. the fact that
 it has produced no visible results.

128
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.780
We need to put an end to 
this whole foolish thing and—

129
00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.780
In that case...

130
00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.870
I will show you results.

131
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.330
Huh?

132
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.450
A big match. bossman.

133
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.710
The time has come for 
Blue Lock to change Japan.

134
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.440
3rd Selection

135
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:13.440
Break Room

136
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.440
(for 5 people)

137
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.390
We seriously drowned out there.

138
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.640
Yeah. I thought I'd gotten stronger
 since coming to Blue Lock.

139
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.100
but I feel like I've been put in my place.

140
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.680
But you know...

141
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.000
After playing guys I thought belonged 
on the other end of a TV screen.

142
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.740
the whole "best in the world" thing 
feels a bit more real to me now.

143
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.400
Yeah. I think I know what you mean.

144
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.130
Becoming the world's best striker
 isn't such a fantasy anymore.

145
00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.670
Yeah! It's far off. for sure.
but it's definitely within sight.

146
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:45.510
Right.

147
00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.050
This feeling must have been
 the point of playing that game.

148
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:50.630
But...

149
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.380
He was different.

150
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:58.470
He was the only one who thought 
we could actually beat the World Five.

151
00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.930
I was totally overwhelmed.

152
00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:05.520
Midway through. I felt I was just
testing myself against better players.

153
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.890
I was happy just taking 
on these players I adored.

154
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.400
and accepted that this was 
the best I could do at this point.

155
00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:18.120
So it's remarkable how 
frustrated you got with it all. Rin.

156
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.010
I still look up to those on the world stage.

157
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.580
But to you. they are your equals.
 and you must defeat them.

158
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:29.930
A guy like you has what it takes
 to become the best in the world.

159
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.350
Rin. I will watch you 
from my front-row seat.

160
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.780
and surpass you to 
become the best in the world!

161
00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.390
Super important!

162
00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.390
2nd Assignment

Language Study

164
00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.390
Start with English

165
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.390
Sunday.

166
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.820
Maun-day.

167
00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:49.970
Tu-ess-day.

168
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.910
Wed... Wed... Weh...

169
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.600
Wed-ness-day?

170
00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.080
It's "Wednesday." idiot.

171
00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.950
And the only one you got right was Sunday.

172
00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.020
How did you get into high school?

173
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.500
Excuse me. Rin-kun.

174
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.910
Is it true that when you introduce yourself. 
you can say "I'm..." instead of "My name is..."?

175
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:08.960
Hey. Rin.

176
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.520
So you have to lightly bite 
your tongue and... "Tess"!

177
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.800
Is that how you pronounce "th"?

178
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.960
Isagi Yoichi chose to work 
on his listening skills first

179
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.020
C'mon. tell us. Rin-kun.

180
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.590
You're the only one who can help.

181
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.560
Tess. Tuss. Toos.

182
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.110
Am I doing it right?

183
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.810
I'm not your damn tutor.

184
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.270
I can...

185
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.240
Fly-day!

186
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.420
I can't take it anymore!

187
00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.510
How long do we have to keep this up?!

188
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.570
Ah. stop!

189
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.560
We need to do this to 
play on the world stage!

190
00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.790
I'm sorry that you're so surly.
 Give your arms a shavey shavey.

191
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:46.770
Ow. I bit my tongue.

192
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.610
They're at it again...

193
00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.360
The second selection has just concluded.

194
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:54.920
Super important!

195
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:54.920

196
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:54.920

Language Study

198
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:54.920
Start with English

199
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.960
and the remaining players 
advance to the third selection.

200
00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:59.610
It's over?

201
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.300
We're finally onto the next one.

202
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.010
Good. I was getting tired of studying.

203
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.500
Please put on your kit and bib.

204
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.890
and make your way to the 
central joint room immediately.

205
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.880
It's time. The next stage is starting.

206
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.520
A total of 35 players from seven teams 
have made it into the third selection.

207
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.990
and you will enter in
 the order you passed.

208
00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.290
Seven teams. huh?

209
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:23.210
Quite a lot dropped out. then.

210
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:24.170
Right.

211
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:27.870
There were 300 of us at the start.
 meaning 265 failed to get through.

212
00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.140
I wonder if those guys made it. too.

213
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.290
Are you missing Team Z or something?

214
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:37.960
Nah.

215
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:44.140
I just wonder how much stronger they are now.
Like. how much they've evolved. you know?

216
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:49.690
And it's not just them. I'm sure there'll
 be more guys who are really good.

217
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:55.530
Could the first team to pass 
the selection please enter?

218
00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.980

221
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.600
I'm getting a little nervous.

222
00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.480
Who do you think the other players will be?

223
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.160
Well. whoever they are. 
they obviously won't be weak.

224
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:15.010
That's true. Only those who have battled 
their way through will have made it here.

225
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:19.630
Could the second team to pass please enter?

226
00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.760
How you got here doesn't matter.

227
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.840
But if you're not here. you don't have 
the right to become the best in the world.

228
00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.680
No matter the outcome. I will accept it.

229
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.000
Because this is Blue Lock.

You guys...

243
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.900
I'm the fourth one.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.020
He's the fifth one.

245
00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:57.720
Hi there!

246
00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.580
Hm?

247
00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.130
Isagi. why do you look so relieved?

248
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.820
Did you think we might not have made it?

249
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.660
Oh. no. not at all...

250
00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.180

254
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.390
We really are just the 
supporting cast to you. huh?

255
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:14.670
That's not true!

256
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.100
It's just. well...

257
00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.030
I'm happy.

Why wouldn't you see us again?

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:27.350
I can't just quit soccer after losing to you.

Like I said. I'm gonna kill you.

I haven't beaten the Top Three. either.

Well. anyway. let's just
 call this reunion fate.

Wait. aren't they missing a player?

295
00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.850
Nishioka Hajime from 
the fifth team to pass

296
00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:02.290
was injured in their World Five game
 and is currently recuperating.

Nishioka \h\h\hHajime

298
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.000

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.740
Guys like them won't let it end here.

328
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:14.510
And to finish off. could the 
seventh team to pass please enter?

329
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:19.100
Amen.

330
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.450
Igaguri?!

331
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:21.450
New BL Ranking

332
00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:22.700
New BL Ranking

333
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.200
New BL Ranking

334
00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:31.580
New BL Ranking

335
00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:33.660
Reo.

336
00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.470
One guy left.

337
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.470
The last person is...

338
00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.130
That's all.

339
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.310
New BL Ranking

340
00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.520
Kunigami...

341
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:57.390
Where's Kunigami?

342
00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.750
That is everyone that has 
advanced to the third selection.

343
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.610
Hey. Reo. Why isn't he here? Well?

344
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.600
We lost.

345
00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.670
I got chosen.

346
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.010
Huh?

347
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:15.570
He wasn't the kind of person who could
become the best striker in the world.

348
00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.550
That's all there is to it.

349
00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:18.860
That can't be true.

350
00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:23.140
There's no way Kunigami would 
let it end in a place like this!

351
00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.980
Well. he did.

352
00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.100
And I'm the one who 
sent him sliding down to hell.

353
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:32.520
Though. sure. he had a great physique.

354
00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:37.280
and his honest heart was 
pure. fair. and graceful. But...

355
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:42.160
On the field. no one gives a shit
if you're a good guy or not.

356
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.370
Anyone who ain't living for 
those explosive flashes is trash.

357
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.740
That innocent and honest 
shit stain of a hero

358
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.700
was just a slime who didn't
 even help me level up.

359
00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:57.510
Shut your hole. You don't know
 a thing about Kunigami—

360
00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.760
Like I said. no one gives a shit...

361
00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.720
about your story!

362
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:05.480
Chigiri?

363
00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.520
This guy's really pissing me off.

364
00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.100
You said it.

365
00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.380
We can take this outside if you like.

366
00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:15.360
If you ask me. you're the slime. 
Mr. Salon Tan Antenna Guy.

367
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:18.740
This tan ain't from the salon. It's all sun. bro.

368
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.200
Okay. settle down. diamonds in the rough.

369
00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:27.410
You have no time to be worrying 
about those who didn't make it.

370
00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:31.060
After all. your own soccer 
careers might go up in smoke

371
00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:36.210
and be relegated to worthless garbage. 
along with Blue Lock itself.

372
00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:39.730
Oh. but before all of that. good work.

373
00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:44.310
That defeat at the hands of the World Five 
was an invaluable experience. I'm sure.

374
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.930
I can tell you the purpose
of that match later. but...

375
00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:52.190
Well. let's just say a lot has
happened. and plans have changed.

376
00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:59.530
Seems the bigwigs of Japanese soccer 
want to shut down Blue Lock and soon.

377
00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:03.490
So I decided to challenge them.

378
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.660
As such. the next selection will 
take place three weeks from now.

379
00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.380
and the future of Blue Lock is riding on it.

380
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:17.170
It'll be a special big match between 
Japan's Under-20s team and the Blue Lock XI.

381
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:26.680
And if you win the match. 
we get to hijack Japan's U-20s team.

382
00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.080
"Hijack"?

383
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.270
Does that mean we'll be on the U-20s?

384
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:37.540
Well. after all. this is a ragtag team of high 
school players. and everyone's a forward.

385
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:41.360
They all snickered and 
readily agreed to the match.

386
00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.470
Their aim is to can the Blue Lock project.

387
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:49.470
and use the buzz over this showdown
to represent Japan to rake in money.

388
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.830
But if we lose. we'll be a laughingstock.

389
00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:57.860
and our names will go down in Japanese soccer 
history as a failed attempt to train up talent.

390
00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.340
So how does what you've 
heard so far make you feel?

391
00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.340
Frustrated at being taken so lightly?

392
00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.800
Or burning with fury and 
wanting to give them a shock?

393
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.930
And I can say this quite 
calmly and pragmatically...

394
00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.860
Right now. you're good enough 
to overthrow Japanese soccer.

395
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:22.450
That said. they're also 
gonna go all-out for the win.

396
00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:24.670
They've added one more 
player to their team.

397
00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:28.240
Itoshi Sae is that player.

398
00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:41.440
Now. it's time to put it all on the line.

399
00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.630
You 35 have discovered your egos. 
mastered weapons and chemical reactions.

400
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:48.400
and seen the level of the 
world's top players firsthand.

401
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.060
Bagging a spot on Japan's 
U-20s is no longer a dream.

402
00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.780
It's a reality you can reach out and grab.

403
00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.110
Let's go. diamonds in the rough.

404
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:04.570
We here at Blue Lock
 will create a new epoch.

405
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:11.020
Episode 24

406
00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:11.020
The Time Has Come

407
00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:22.340
Isagi!

408
00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:23.760
Over here! I'm free!

409
00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:28.390
"One for all and all for one."

410
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:33.390
I used to think soccer was a sport 
where eleven players fought as one.

411
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.520
But now I know it's not.

412
00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:44.560
In soccer. the one who scores 
the most is the greatest.

413
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.510
Soccer exists for strikers.

414
00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:53.410
And as a striker. nothing should bring 
you more joy than your own goals.

415
00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:56.000
You should live only for that moment.

416
00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:00.040
I'm not fighting for all of you.

417
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:04.500
I'm not fighting for someone else's dream.

418
00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.550
I am me.

419
00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:11.560
This is my dream. My fight.

420
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:14.590
I'm glad I got to fight alongside you.

421
00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.640
And that's why I'll climb over your corpses.

422
00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:35.310
I was a complete unknown and 
a total nobody until recently.

423
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.770
but if we win this. I could 
end up on Japan's U-20s team.

424
00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:42.880
With this one game.

425
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.950
I can change my life completely.

426
00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:50.430
All of us are only here to win.

427
00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.150
I won't let them put an end to Blue Lock.

428
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:58.660
I will change the world with my goal.

429
00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:04.900
I'll become the best striker in the world!
