1
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.690
My weapon is my magnificent
shooting techniques.

2
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.120
And my motto is: "Sexy soccer!"

3
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.910
Mine is getting in behind.

4
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.000
Mine is... being physical.

5
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.040
I'm an all-rounder.

6
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.670
Mine's my "never give up" attitude!

7
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.630
Mine's the power in my left-footed shots.

8
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.340
Mine's my speed and technique.

9
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.300
Mine's... dribbling...

10
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.720
"Dribbling."

11
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.810
Mine is my jumping.

12
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.060
Who's next? Isagi-kun?

13
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.410
Uh. my weapon?

14
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.810
Oh. hm... I wonder what it is...

15
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.990
Your passing?

16
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.670
No. I can't say that as a striker.

17
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.090
The fact you don't even know
 means you're doomed. Next!

18
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.810
Wait. hold on...

19
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.070
Well. tell us when you think of something.

20
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.740
Last of all. Chigiri.

21
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.200
Not telling.

22
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.690
Huh? But that's the 
whole point of this conversation.

23
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.710
I know. but I don't want to say it.

24
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.710
What the hell? Let's just ignore
 the selfish queen over there.

25
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.580
Guess we'll have to.

26
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.620
Anyway. a striker needs a powerful weapon. 
and how you make use of it is important.

27
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.680
But if everyone just does what they want. 
won't it end up like the last game?

28
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.260
Can we really win by 
doing what Ego told us to?

29
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.730
Even with weapons. if we aren't 
coordinated. they're meaningless.

30
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.430
Can't we come up with a strategy 
where all of us can shine or something?

31
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.250
I see.

32
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.370
Yeah. this might work. 
This way. we'll all get an equal chance.

33
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.540
With this strategy. we might win.

34
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.290
How do we

35
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.290
use each weapon?

36
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.290
We're all strikers

37
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.290
Equal chance

38
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.290
Plausible plan

39
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.290
minutes

40
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.290
Time shifts
within
90 minutes!

41
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.290
Peaceful
solution

42
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.290
Position
change?

43
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.290
Move clockwise

44
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.290
to minimize time loss

45
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.290
Operation name?

46
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.290
The Roulette System

47
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.290
The Roulette Eleven System

48
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.290
The "I'm Next" System

49
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.290
"Next Up. It's Me"
 Eleven

50
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.290
Goalie?

51
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.170
It's called:

52
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.090
Operation: "Next Up. It's Me" Eleven!

53
00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.510
Lame name.

54
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.980
Episode 4

55
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.980
Premonition
and Intuition

56
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.820
Time it so it gets to me here!

57
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.090
Okay!

58
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.040
It's not like we're a team all of a sudden.

59
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.610
Not like that. I want it to feet.

60
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.830
Okay. okay. Stop whining.

61
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.210
Isagi. don't drop back!

62
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.160
Hold the line!

63
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.290
Gotcha.

64
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.750
Lose and your soccer career is over.

65
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.230
I feel this simple fact has 
made us come together as a team.

66
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.930
Natto

67
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:06.390
Natto

68
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.300
Natto

69
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.430
Natto

70
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.550
Natto

71
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.770
I'm super late for dinner.

72
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.930
It's been a week since I came to Blue Lock.

73
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.610
Honestly. nothing's helping my confidence.

74
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.240
I don't have any weapon I can be proud of.

75
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.160
You have no talent.

76
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.700
Maybe I don't have a weapon...

77
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.170
I'm tired of natto.

78
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.630
Good work today. Isagi.

79
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.450
Kunigami.

80
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.350
You're still getting natto?

81
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.710
That's just how it is when
 you rank near the bottom.

82
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.310
Hey. wait... You haven't had dinner yet?

83
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.620
I just ate.

84
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.770
I came to talk to you.

85
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.160
Hm? What about?

86
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.060
I never said thank you.

87
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.240
For what?

88
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.120
Thanks for the pass.

89
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.190
Oh. in the last game? That's all?

90
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.160
Yeah. I believe in doing
 things the right way.

91
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.340
Anyway. that's all. Good night.

92
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.800
Hey. wait a minute!

93
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.420
Hm?

94
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.760
Kunigami. why do you play soccer?

95
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.240
Huh? What kind of a question is that?

96
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.360
Oh. uh. it's just...

97
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.160
You have lots of weapons I don't.
 like your shot power and your strong frame.

98
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.320
So I was just wondering what an 
amazing guy like you thought about.

99
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.070
Jeez. what am I saying...

100
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.550
I'm sorry. It feels like 
I'm embarrassing myself here.

101
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.980
Forget I asked. Good night.

102
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.660
That's easy.

103
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.660
I'm gonna be a soccer superhero.

104
00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:57.580
Huh?

105
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:04.960
When I was small. I didn't look up to 
Sentai heroes. robots. or pirate kings.

106
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:14.140
I idolized strikers who ran about on green 
pitches and scored goals to win games.

107
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.510
Those players weren't fictional.

108
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.940
They were real-life superheroes 
who excited me and gave me courage.

109
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.290
That's who I want to become.

110
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.470
Are you serious?

111
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.540
Deadly. I don't care if someone 
thinks it's silly and laughs at me.

112
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.280
I'm not embarrassed at all.

113
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.170
To achieve my dream. I will fight 
the right way and take on the world.

114
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:44.800
Man...

115
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.550
He has a really strong resolve. unlike me.

116
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.370
That's cool.

117
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.510
You're so badass.

118
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.180
Isagi. you want some?

119
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.040
Huh? A steak?

120
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.090
What?!

121
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.650

The goal bonus list is up there.

If you score a goal. you can 
trade your points for prizes.

135
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.080
Cell phone? Bed? Yes. please.

136
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.900
A "One day outside Blue Lock" pass?!

137
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.540
I owe half of that goal to you.

138
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.270
So half of this meat belongs to you.

139
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.240
What? Are you serious?

140
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.340
It's been so long! No more natto!

141
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.710
But why did you pass 
the ball to me back then?

142
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:34.300
Hm?

143
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.510
I'm pretty sure Raichi was more open.

144
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.540
so I was wondering why you passed it 
to me when I had defenders around me.

145
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.680
Oh. right. It was sorta unconscious.
 Like a reflex or something.

146
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.580
Even if I'd passed to Raichi. it didn't 
change the fact Barou was in front of us.

147
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:57.120
So I suppose I smelled a goal if I could 
just set you up for a mid-range shot.

148
00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.000
I knew how powerful 
it was from experience.

149
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.070
You "smelled" a goal?

150
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.970
Maybe that's your weapon.

151
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:10.810
Being able to make instant decisions 
is more impressive than you may think.

152
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.340
Man. this is crazy good!

153
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.950
Eat up. Isagi.

154
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:18.490
Oh. sure.

155
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.730
Oh. wow. it's hella good!

156
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.440
Right?

157
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.140
Thanks. Kunigami. 
This really cheered me up.

158
00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.320
You're such a nice guy.

159
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.930
Shut up. I didn't do it to be "nice."

160
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:39.370
You don't take compliments well. do you?

161
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.210
Oh. whatever. Let's just eat and head to bed.

162
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:44.250
And our next game...

163
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.000
We're gonna win it for sure.

164
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:52.570
Yeah!

Here they come.

173
00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:04.150
Team Y.

174
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:09.420
Like us. Team Y lost their first match. 
so their backs are against the wall.

They'll be desperate.

180
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.070
We need to keep a close
 eye on their Number 9.

181
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.650
His shooting's off the chart.

182
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.620
Kumamoto prefecture's top scorer:

Ohkawa Hibiki.

186
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.910
Let's go. guys!

187
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:22.910
Yeah!

188
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:29.670
But this time. we concocted a plan. 
Let's have faith our practice will pay off.

189
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.160
Even if we have to die for it. 
we will win. Team Z!

190
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.300
Yeah!

191
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.350
All right.

192
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.460
The key to this plan is the 
weapons Ego talked about.

193
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.220
How do we

194
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.220
use each weapon?

195
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.220
We're all strikers

196
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.220
Equal chance

197
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.220
Plausible plan

198
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.220
minutes

199
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.220
Time shifts
within
90 minutes!

200
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.220
Peaceful
solution

201
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.220
Position
change?

202
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.220
Move clockwise

203
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.220
to minimize time loss

204
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.220
Operation name?

205
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.220
The Roulette System

206
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.220
The Roulette Eleven System

207
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.220
The "I'm Next" System

208
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.220
"Next Up. It's Me"
 Eleven

209
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.220
Goalie?

210
00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:43.220
This is an ultra-offensive system that
makes the best use of all our weapons.

211
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.930
But if each of us uses our weapon with 
no real plan in place. we'll just crumble.

212
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:53.190
So we'll divide up the clock 
and take turns as the front man.

213
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.900
To spotlight one guy's weapon. the rest 
of us will create a formation around him.

214
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.910
and support the type of 
soccer he wants to play.

215
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.410
I guess it means we all get an equal 
chance. but what order do we go in?

216
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:06.500
What if we do it by rank?

217
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.660
What about the other positions?

218
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.420
Switching all of them
would be way too confusing.

219
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.490
No. we can all just rotate
 one position clockwise.

220
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.180
The next one's close enough 
that it won't be a problem.

221
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:24.360
From a defensive perspective. it's too risky
 for all eleven of us to take turns in goal.

222
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:28.100
We have to win this. so I'll stay 
as the goalie for the whole game.

223
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.230
I don't mind staying in defense.

224
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:35.190
You lack self-assertiveness. 
which means ya got no talent!

225
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:40.700
I'd rather not do it like this. but just 
this once. I'll go along with your plan.

226
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.530
Me too.

227
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:49.000
Okay. so everyone except Iemon and Chigiri
will rotate positions every ten minutes.

228
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.380
Instead of "Operation: 
'Next Up. It's Me' Eleven"...

229
00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.900
You ready?

230
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.090

232
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.260
We'll call it: "Operation:
 'Next Up. It's Me' Nine!"

233
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.510
Bachira's weapon is his dribbling.

234
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.720
It's a solo tactic. where he gets
as far upfield as he can by himself.

235
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:12.640
It's an egoistic tactic only available to 
someone whose weapon is overwhelming.

236
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.860
Make it a two-on-one!

237
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.560
Don't let him through!

238
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.780
Will two be enough?

239
00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.360
I'm coming through.

240
00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:23.490
There are three of us. 
I've done my homework on your dribbling.

241
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.410
You're not bad. Mr. Bangs.

242
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.090
In that case. I'll pass it back.

243
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:27.950
R-Right!

244
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:34.130
They blocked his potential routes. 
and used a third person to steal the ball.

245
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.880
Keep an eye on their Number 8!

246
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.670
Got it!

247
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.880
Number 9 inbound! Mark him!

248
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:38.880
They couldn't have improvised this.

249
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.050
They're also working to a plan.

250
00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.820
And why wouldn't they be?

251
00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.850
Just like us. if they lose. they're out.

252
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:45.890
Bachira. go again!

253
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:46.390
'Kay.

254
00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:47.480
Incoming down the wing!

255
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.950
Don't give them space!

256
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:53.310
Our plan is a super aggressive one
that uses each player's weapon.

257
00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:56.450
Their plan is to defend
 and nullify our weapons.

258
00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.980
Bachira's dribbling is proving effective.

259
00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:03.000
And what's more. we have eight 
more weapons up our sleeves.

260
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.030
If we keep this up. we'll find an opening.

261
00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:06.150
We can win!

262
00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:07.830
Yo. that's ten minutes!

263
00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:08.990
'Kay!

264
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.130
Wingers. move up!

th

267
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:16.760
Kunigami's weapon is his 
left-footed mid-range shot.

268
00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.880
He'll run straight to the front line.

269
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.130
linger just outside the crowded penalty area...

270
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:23.840
Just like we practiced!

271
00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.970
He'll receive the pass...

272
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:25.700
Shoot!

273
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.720
Now's your chance.

274
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.600
...and blast the ball along the 
path we create for his shot!

275
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.560
His shot was blocked?

276
00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.540
It's clear!

277
00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.730
Their defense is really tight.

278
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.530
Bachira. let's build once more.

279
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:44.420
'Kay.

280
00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.910
Eliminate the space in 
front of the Number 9.

281
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:47.910
Make it a two-on-one!

282
00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.330
They're not attacking at all.

283
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.120
And Ohkawa's been so quiet.

284
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:58.060
He's the only one not defending.
But what is he waiting for?

285
00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:00.800
Nice pass. Bachira.

286
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.130
I'll score it this time!

287
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.470
Ah. damn it! Not again!

288
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.060
Get the second ball!

289
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.520
Oh. crap. So that's why.

290
00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.650
Yup. this is what I was waiting for.

291
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.370
We weren't overwhelming them at all.

292
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:24.110
They drew us onto them!

293
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.210
Their aim was...

294
00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:28.030
What took you so long. Niko?

295
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.510
Counting on you. Ohkawa-kun.

A counterattack!

299
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:43.590
They got us.

300
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.130
The target was Kumamoto's top scorer...

301
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.300
Ohkawa!

302
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.720
Here he comes!

303
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.150
Yeah!

304
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.150
Nice shot!

305
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:05.960
There's the first goal!

306
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:12.780
They were looking for an opening 
so they could use Ohkawa Hibiki's weapon:

307
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.510
his outstanding shooting.

308
00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:19.670
You were meant to be marking him. 
Naruhaya! Don't just let Ohkawa run free!

309
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.810
I can't stop him by myself!

310
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:23.710
We need two to stop Ohkawa!

311
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:25.780
It's clear now.

312
00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:30.430
Their plan is to drop back and defend. 
then steal the ball and counterattack.

313
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:34.110
If we don't find a way to stop Ohkawa. 
we have no hope of winning.

314
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.640
Let's get another.

315
00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.560
Let's not dwell on it. It's only 1-0.

316
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.270
He's right. We still have time.

317
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:43.690
We're counting on you. Kuon!

318
00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.690
Kuon’s weapon is his jumping.

He challenges for the ball. wins it. 
and lays it off to start the attack.

322
00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.410
Surround him!

323
00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.010
Make it a two-on-one at all times!

324
00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:55.900
Damn. they're making this tough.

325

Your feet aren't moving.

326
00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.250
Here he comes!

327
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.630
Passing it around in his own half?

Oh. right. Now that they're ahead. 
they're in no hurry to attack.

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.210
They're running down the clock.

330
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.310
This is bad.

331
00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.400
All right! It's Raichi time!

332
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.520

334
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.470
Just keep passing me the ball.

335
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:28.230
I'll take care of the rest. Ya got that?

336
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:28.860
Time Left of Half-Time

337
00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.150

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.530
Time Left of Half-Time

339
00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.970
Are you shittin' me?! 
Get the ball back. damn it!

340
00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:37.120
They had possession for the
whole of my ten minutes!

341
00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:41.460
My first five minutes were wasted. too. 
They were over before I could do anything.

342
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.330
You say that. but what do we do if we try
 to win it. fail. and Ohkawa ends up with it?

343
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:47.050
Huh?!

344
00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:51.060
But we're gonna lose at this rate!
 If we lose. we're done! Don't ya get that?!

345
00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:55.010
But if they score another. 
we've as good as lost. too! Think about it!

346
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:57.980
Stop fighting.

347
00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:04.100
I hear even the pros have a hard time 
breaking down ultra-defensive teams.

348
00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.070
To win. we have to be more 
aggressive in the second half.

349
00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:10.150
But you know. is this plan even going to work?

350
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:14.780
If our weapons are ineffective against 
them. we'll just die a slow death.

351
00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:18.740
Ya can't even tell us your weapon.
 so stop your damn yappin'!

352
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:23.480
To improve our chances of winning. 
instead of wasting time on useless weapons.

353
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:29.000
I'm saying we should focus on Bachira and 
Kunigami. whose styles annoy the other team.

354
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.540
Who're ya callin' "useless"?!

355
00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.060
Stop arguing.

356
00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.900
It's riskier to change 
the plan at this point.

357
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:39.240
I'm certain it'll be harder for them
 to figure out countermeasures

358
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.180
if we keep switching up our tactics.

359
00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.190
Our attacks are not useless.

360
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.020
Don't fear Ohkawa's counterattack.
 We'll keep on attacking!

361
00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:52.190
Let's resume "Operation: 'Next Up. 
It's Me' Nine!" It's our best course of action!

362
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:53.030
Yeah!

363
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:53.030
Gotcha!

364
00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:00.130
Do we really have a 
chance of winning like this?

365
00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:04.250
Second half begins

366
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.040
Kick it back! Don't force the issue!

367
00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.540
Make 'em run! Make 'em run!

368
00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.750
Nothing's changed since the first half!

369
00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:15.630
Damn it. It's meant to be my time to
 shine. but I can't even get on the ball.

th

372
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:17.800
If I press. they evade.

373
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:20.760
But waiting it out won't get us anywhere.

374
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.870
To me. soccer is exactly like romance.

375
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:26.470
This current situation is kinda like...

376
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:28.230
when a girl's out of your league!

377
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:32.450
On the face of it. she's tough to win over. 
but in reality. she has zero experience.

378
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.010
and once she falls for me. 
she's head over heels.

379
00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:37.570
That girl is Miss Team Y!

380
00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.740
Once Miss Y falls. 
she'll be an easy mark.

381
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:41.790
Gotcha!

382
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.120
Damn it all!

383
00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:46.540
Your pressing didn't go to waste.

384
00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.710
That's ten minutes!

385
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.770
My turn next.

386
00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.670

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.460
Nice! We finally got the ball!

389
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.920
Switch positions! Get into 
the Gagamaru formation!

390
00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.640
Seven minutes into the second half. 
A goal'd be nice right about now.

391
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.040
Counting on you. Isagi.

392
00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:01.600
Right!

393
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:05.060
Gagamaru's plan starts 
with me out on the wing.

394
00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:10.150
I'm aiming to hit an early cross into that 
near-impossible space in front of the goal.

395
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.860
Oh. crap. I overhit it.

396
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:18.150
He'll reach it. His weapon 
is his incredible agility.

397
00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:22.850
Ah. so close!

398
00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.660
Stick with it! It's a corner!

399
00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.330
How'd he even get to that?

400
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:27.490
Corner incoming!

401
00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:29.120
Darn. I'll try again.

402
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:33.650
That was amazing. 
His weapon will work. We got this!

403
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.100
What was that just now?

404
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.630
Was it Ohkawa?

405
00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:46.660
This chance might turn into a disaster 
if they get the ball and counter.

406
00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.310
Get it together. Isagi!

407
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:50.230
It's a corner! Get into position!

408
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:53.270
Flood the box!

409
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.190
Doesn't matter how it goes in! Just score!

410
00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.130
That's right. If we don't attack now. then when?

411
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:01.450
This is the first chance we've had.

412
00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.520
Our first chance...

413
00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.410
Oh. I see.

414
00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.080
This premonition comes from...

415
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:10.790
Isagi?

416
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:11.750
It's mine!

417
00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.340
We misread the situation.

418
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:17.130
The one who was crushing our chances...

419
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:22.760
The one who's been calling the shots
and feeding killer passes to Ohkawa...

420
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.090
Aw. shit!

421
00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:25.560
Nice. goalie!

422
00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:25.850
Let's counter!

423
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:29.310
Crap! We sent too many forward!

424
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.560
If they get the ball to Ohkawa now...

425
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:38.020
It's here!

426
00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:43.240
The uneasy premonition I felt was coming 
from the beating heart of Team Y.

427
00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:45.640
That's you. Niko!

428
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:48.080
Nice. Isagi!

429
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.990
If we can shut him out. Team Y dies.

430
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.040
So now's our chance!

431
00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:59.210
I know I can make this shot!

432
00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.300
Crap!

433
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.540
I missed.

434
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:13.310
Yeah!

435
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:17.490
Hell yeah! We caught up!

436
00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.400
Nice pass. Isagi.

437
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.680
Gagamaru?

438
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.610
Uh. it was supposed to be a shot.

439
00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:25.570
We're level!

440
00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:26.120
Huh?

441
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.160
Damn. I got all happy 
over someone else's goal.

442
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:29.870
The scores are even now.

443
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.770
I'm amazed you reacted!

444
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.210
Gagamaru. that was awesome!

445
00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.420
One more goal. The comeback win is on.

446
00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:37.770
Yeah!

447
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.460
You caught on. huh?

448
00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:45.230
Without you. we could have 
countered and killed off the game.

449
00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:47.510
I won't let you run free now.

450
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.310
We will shut you out and win this game!

451
00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.590
You have the same eyes as me.

452
00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.320
But you can't beat me.

453
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.780
I'm the one controlling this game.

454
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:08.580
Just you wait. you bastard with bangs.

455
00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:41.180

other guys get for their main dish?

The king! The perfect dish to have with rice!

489
00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:07.650
Namaste!

490
00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.910
Hey. Kunigami. wanna trade dishes?

491
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.760
We'll give you natto and
