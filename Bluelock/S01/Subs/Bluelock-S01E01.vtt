I'm over here. loser!

29
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.860
I'm gonna score.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.070

Tada-chan?

Remember. it's one 
for all and all for one!

37
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.050
That's right. Soccer's played 
with eleven guys on a team.

38
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.090
All right! Now we're tiedâ€”

39
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.220
No way!

40
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.390
Counter!

41
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.800

Crap!

45
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.770
Stop them!

46
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.570
Get through!

47
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.620

49
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.920
Sorry. guys!

50
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.040
If only... If only I'd scored...

51
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.050
It's not your fault. Tada-chan.

52
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.260
I'm sorry!

53
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.010
Kira-kun!

54
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.180
You're so awesome!

55
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.890
Kira. people call you the 
jewel of Japanese soccer.

56
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.520
You were even called up to 
play for Japan's U-18 team.

57
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.600
Could you tell us about that?

58
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.690
Well. right now. I'm focusing on 
winning at nationals with this team.

59
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.860
The one thing I can really say is...

60
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.070
The only reason I am who I am now 
is because of the guys on this team.

61
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.280
Kira-kun. you're amazing!

62
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.000
You guys fought well.

63
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.210
The third-years are retiring.

64
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.710
You should be proud of the days 
you spent fighting together as a team.

65
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.550
Someday. you'll look back on this loss...

66
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.890
And feel like... it wasn't a waste!

67
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:53.270
As far as I'm concerned. this Ichinan team
 is the best damn soccer team in Japan!

68
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.110
No.

69
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.740
We're a team that didn't make it to nationals
 'cause we lost in the prefectural qualifier.

70
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.410
And I'm an unknown second-year 
forward on that team.

71
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.960
That's the reality.

72
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.670
I'm sorry. Noa-sama.

73
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.340
I doubt I'll be able to become...

74
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.670
Europe's Best Player

75
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.670
France
Team

76
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.560
A direct volley!

77
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.930
What a wonder goal!

78
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.940
...a superstar like you.

79
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.730
Wow. Yocchan!

80
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.110
You're unstoppable!

81
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.820
I admired you so much.

82
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.110
Nice shot!

83
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.320
You're way too good to be a middle schooler!

84
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.070
And continued to play soccer. But...

85
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.830
Remember. it's one for all and all for one!

86
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.580
Let's go to nationals together!

87
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.700
Yeah!

88
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.920
It looks like my dream will 
never be more than a dream.

89
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.670
My idiotic dream of becoming a 
star striker for the national team...

90
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.840
and winning the World Cup.

91
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.730
If. in that moment. I hadn't passed...

92
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.940
but taken the shot instead...

93
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.570
Would my fate have been any different?

94
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.830
One for all. All for one.

95
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.500
Soccer is played with eleven guys on a team.

96
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.880
You can't do it alone.

97
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.890
Damn it.

98
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.900
I really wanted to win.

99
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.320
I'm home.

100
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.320
Welcome back. How did the game go?

101
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.160
We lost. I'm hungry.

102
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.410
Too bad. I even made 
pork cutlet for good luck.

103
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.950
You're supposed to eat that 
the day before the game.

104
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.080
Oh. is that right?

105
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.210
Well. it's good. Eat up.

106
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.550
By the way. a letter arrived for you 
from the Japan Football Union.

107
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.510
What?

108
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.470
Isagi Yoichi-sama

109
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.470
You have been selected

110
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.470
to become a certified athlete

111
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.470
A "certified athlete"?

112
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.220
That's a good thing. right?

113
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.640
No idea!

114
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.520
Why me?

115
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.150
Is this the right place?

116
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.780
Oh. hey. you're from Ichinan.

117
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.740
Isagi-kun. right?

118
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.830
You were invited. too? Figures. 
Good game the other day.

119
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.580
Do you know who I am?

120
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.120
Uh. Kira-kun...

121
00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.540
Y-Yes. of course. We only 
just lost to you the other day.

122
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.670
I totally remember you.

123
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.840
You've got. like. a broad perspective
 on the game. A high soccer IQ.

124
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.550
If we were on the same team. 
I'd bet you'd hit some amazing passes to me.

125
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.260
Uh. thank you.

126
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.020
No way. For real? 
Kira Ryosuke is complimenting me?

127
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.770
Then. shall we? You know. I have 
no idea what we're gonna do here.

128
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:23.730
Neither do I.

129
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.110
No need to be so polite. 
We're the same age.

130
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.700
Nice to meet you. Isagi-kun.

131
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.620
Thanks!

132
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.740
He's so nice.

133
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.870
This seems like the place.

134
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.260
There's a ton of guys here.

135
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.760
I see some guys I recognize.

136
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.970
Sennou's star player. Okawa.

137
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.760
The tallest high school athlete. Ishikari.

138
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.100
Even Nishioka. the 
"Messi of Aomori."  is here.

139
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.560
Huh? Is everyone here a forward?

140
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.030
Congratulations. diamonds in the rough.

141
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.030
You are the 300 18-and-under 
strikers who have been chosen

142
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.330
according to my arbitrary 
and biased decision-making.

143
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:24.540
And I am Ego Jinpachi. the man hired to
 make sure Japan wins the World Cup.

144
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.470
Huh? What'd he just say?

145
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.550
Wins... the World Cup?

146
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.720
Who is he?

147
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.060
Do you know him?

148
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.640
No. no clue.

149
00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:44.230
Simply put. there's one thing Japanese soccer 
needs to become the best in the world:

150
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.320
The birth of a revolutionary striker.

151
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:53.110
I'll be performing an experiment here to turn 
one of you 300 into the world's best striker.

152
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.490
And that's what this facility is for.

153
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.950
"Blue Lock."

154
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.540
Starting today. you will live here together

155
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.330
and undergo the special 
top training I've devised.

156
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.130
You won't be allowed to go home.

157
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.630
and you'll say goodbye to whatever soccer
 life you've been living up to now.

158
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.420
But I promise you this:

159
00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.760
If you manage to survive and 
beat out the 299 other guys here

160
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.350
to become the last man standing. 
you will be the world's greatest striker.

161
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.350
That is all. Nice to meet you.

162
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.690
What's he talking about?

163
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.280
Um. excuse me.

164
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.120
I can't agree to the 
conditions you just laid out.

165
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.990
Each of us has a team 
that's important to us.

166
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.700
Some of us have nationals coming up.

167
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.750
I can't abandon my team to participate 
in some nonsensical program.

168
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.210
Yeah. I've got nationals. too.

169
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.130
Why would we suddenly
 start living together?

170
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.510
Who even are you?

171
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.470
We demand to speak to
 someone who isn't crazy.

172
00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:02.140
I see. You're all seriously ill. then.

173
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.480
Lock off.

174
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.480
Leave

175
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.690
Anyone who wants to leave can go.

176
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:13.360
Is becoming the number one high school 
team in this backwards country

177
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.570
more important to you than 
becoming the world's best striker? Hm?

178
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:21.290
Just thinking that the future of Japan 
is in your hands makes me lose hope.

179
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.950
Huh? What?

180
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.200
Listen up.

181
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.960
The power of Japanese soccer 
organizations is first-rate.

182
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.380
You could call it the result 
of Japanese thoughtfulness.

183
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.590
But in all other respects. 
it is undeniably second-rate.

184
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.180
Let me ask you this: What is soccer?

185
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:41.390
Is it about eleven guys working together?

186
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.100
Valuing your ties to others?

187
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.600
Self-sacrifice?

188
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.140
Playing for your teammates?

189
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.730
This is why this country's 
soccer has remained weak.

190
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.320
I'll tell you the answer.

191
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:59.450
Soccer is about scoring more 
goals than your opponent.

192
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.620
Whoever scores the most 
goals is the greatest.

193
00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.910
If you just want to play friendly games 
with your buddies. then lock off.

194
00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:05.540
Leave

195
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:11.130
What's with this guy? He's crazy.

196
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.340
That's a terrible thing to say. 
Take it back.

197
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:18.590
There are many athletes on the
 Japanese team who I respect.

198
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.930
We grew up watching them 
fight together as an eleven.

199
00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.270
They are my superstars.

200
00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.520
You're wrong.

201
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.900
What? The Japanese team?

202
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.530
But they've never won 
the World Cup. have they?

203
00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.780
I'm talking about becoming 
the best in the world.

204
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.330
"Instead of assisting 
my teammates to win 1-0."

205
00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.920
"it feels better to pull off
a hat trick and lose 3-4."

206
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.710
These are the words of the world's 
greatest striker. Noel Noa.

207
00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:00.760
who beat Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo 
to win the Ballon d'Or.

208
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:06.720
Eric Cantona said. "I don't care about 
my team. I just want to stand out."

209
00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:12.980
PelÃ© said. "The world's best forward. 
midfielder. defender. and goalkeeper."

210
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.320
"Whichever you ask about. 
the answer is still me."

211
00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.030
Well? Awful. right?

212
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.360
But they're all top. top players!

213
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.990
And they're all extraordinary egoists!

214
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.540
That's what Japanese soccer lacks.

215
00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:35.750
You can't become the world's best striker 
unless you're the world's biggest egoist.

216
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.720
The things this man is saying...

217
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.090
I want to create that kind of person here.

218
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.510
...are probably wrong.

219
00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:51.560
Someone who will stand on 299 corpses.

220
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:54.810
A solitary hero.

221
00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:00.320
I can't do it. After all. 
I haven't achieved anything.

222
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.660
Just imagine it. 
You're in the World Cup final.

223
00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.660
Eighty thousand people in the stands. 
You're standing on the field.

224
00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.330
The score is 0-0.

225
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.080
It's the second half of extra time.

226
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.710
It's the last play. With a pass from your 
teammate. you're through the defense.

227
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.710
It's you against the goalkeeper.

228
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.880
Six meters to your right is your teammate.

229
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.260
If you pass. you're 
guaranteed to score a goal.

230
00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.890
In a moment when the entire nation's hopes 
and the championship are riding on you.

231
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:31.520
only an insane egoist can take 
that shot without hesitation.

232
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.650
Pass through these doors.

233
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.780
Abandon all common sense.

234
00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:43.360
On the field. you're the star.

235
00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.240
Nobody ever taught me any of this.

236
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.080
Nothing should bring you more
 joy than your own goals.

237
00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.620
Live only for that moment.

238
00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.000
Isn't that what it means to be a striker?

239
00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.930
I am a striker!

240
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.560
Isagi-kun?

241
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.520
I'll play your dumb game. shithead!

242
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.100
Me. too!

243
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.030
Shall we begin?

244
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:37.580
Nowhere in the world is the soccer 
more intense than it is at Blue Lock.

245
00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.640
I'm 299Z. so I guess I'm in Room Z.

246
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:55.140
Oh. here it is.

247
00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:06.990
Isagi-kun.

248
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:10.240
I'm so glad I'm sharing a room 
with someone I know.

249
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.700
Kira-kun.

250
00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.040
I'm relieved. too.

251
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:15.660
Oh. my bad.

252
00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.580
Threw my clothes too hard.

253
00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:22.090
It's totally fine. Here.

254
00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.340
Watch where you're walking.

255
00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:23.960
Huh?

256
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.300
Hey. Zico. Pass.

257
00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.390
Pass the ball. Zico.

258
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.850
What the heck's he dreaming about?

259
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.400
Are you the Kira Ryosuke?

260
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.310
Wow. it's really you.

261
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.020
Uh. thanks.

262
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.230
Nice to meet you.

263
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.950
My name's Igarashi Gurimu.

264
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.990
2nd
Year

265
00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.700
Oh. nice to meet you.

266
00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:54.200
My family runs a temple. but I really don't 
want to take over the family business.

267
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.040
So when I heard all that earlier. 
I couldn't stop shaking.

268
00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.170
I felt like this is my chance 
to change my life.

269
00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:04.710
Have you finished changing. 
diamonds in the rough?

270
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:07.760
Hello. there.

271
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.260
The guys you're sharing your rooms 
with are both your roommates

272
00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.350
and rivals who will help you improve.

273
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.680
Your abilities have been 
quantified and ranked by me

274
00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.560
according to my arbitrary 
and biased decision-making.

275
00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.940
That's what the numbers 
on your uniforms represent.

276
00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:26.280
You can tell at a glance 
what your rank out of 300 is.

277
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.740
Wait. 299th? Crap. I'm so low.

278
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:35.580
Your rank can change based on the
 results of your training or matches.

279
00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:39.120
And the top five players will 
unconditionally get to play

280
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.460
in the tournament being 
held six months from now.

281
00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:45.920
They'll be registered as forwards 
for the U-20 World Cup.

282
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:50.130
The U-20 Japanese team?

283
00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:55.260
Additionally. anyone 
who loses at Blue Lock...

284
00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.310
...will never get to play for Japan.

285
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:02.140
What?

286
00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:07.650
What you need to gain here is ego.

287
00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:10.360
I'll be testing you now to measure that.

288
00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.570
So it's time to play tag.

289
00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.450
You have 136 seconds.

290
00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:18.580
Whoever's struck by the ball is "it."

291
00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.620
Whoever's "it" the moment time 
runs out will be locked off.

292
00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.040
Huh? What?

293
00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.630
Also. no using your hands.

294
00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:29.590
What?

295
00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.880
What? This isn't soccer.

296
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.840
I'm "it" first because I'm ranked the lowest?

297
00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.470
Fine. let's do this.

298
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.100
No hard feelings.

299
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.600
Hey. wait. You actually 
believe what he said?

300
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.440
What if he was for real?

301
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.820
I'm doing this.

302
00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.400
If I lose. I'll be a temple monk
 for the rest of my life.

303
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:57.240
Anyone who loses here will 
never be able to play for Japan.

304
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.080
Hey. stay away from me!

305
00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.580
Sorry. Isagi-kun!

306
00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:06.130
What?

307
00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:07.250
Amen!

308
00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.670
Crap!

309
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.670
This is ridiculous.

310
00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:16.220
I'm here so I can prove him wrong.

311
00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:18.550
Don't screw with me!

312
00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.890
This is definitely wrong.

313
00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:23.270
I won't let him ruin my future.

314
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:26.480
Damn it. I can't hit anyone.

315
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:32.990
He's still asleep. Gotcha!

316
00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:41.910
Hey. that's a foul.

317
00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:44.410
If this were a game. that'd be a red card.

318
00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.710
Only handballs are against the rules. right?

319
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:48.630
Morning.

320
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.460
What's with this guy?

321
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.210
Hey. I'm not a fan of dirty play.

322
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.260
Play fair.

323
00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.220
Mr. Strait-Laced. huh?

324
00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.890
You left yourself open. Amen.

325
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:08.060
Bastard.

326
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.270
I'll destroy you.

327
00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.150
Here!

328
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:12.020
Hey!

329
00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:14.860

331
00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:15.530
Don't...

332
00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:20.620
Amen.

333
00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:21.450
Isagi-kun?

334
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:24.160
Oh. sorry. Wrong person.

335
00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.540
Crap.

336
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:35.210
If I don't hit someone. my soccer 
career will be over in one minute.

337
00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:39.640
I don't want things to end here.

338
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:42.300
Safe!

339
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.140
They're so athletic.

340
00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.480
I'll have to aim carefully 
if I want to hit anyone.

341
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.900
I should go after someone 
ranked lower than me.

342
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.730
Can't catch me!

343
00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.780
Is my fate really going to 
be decided by this game?

344
00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.450
Crap. this is really bad.

345
00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:06.910
No. I don't want to lose. 
I don't want things to end.

346
00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:10.170
I'll do anything. I just want to win.

347
00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.500
I want to keep playing soccer!

348
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.380
I don't want my dream to end!

349
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.140
You little shit! Get off of me!

350
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:21.140
Here's your chance.

351
00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:22.590
Let go of me!

352
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.300
Get him! Over there!

353
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:28.230
I said play fair!

354
00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:30.890
Ow.

355
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:32.310
Get off me!

356
00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.900
Oh. shit. Wait. timeout.

357
00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.280
Isagi-kun. hit him!

358
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.410
Before it's too late!

359
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.870
Hey. wait. Stay back. Stay away from me.

360
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:51.580
I don't want this to end here.

361
00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.210
I can win. I can survive.

362
00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:57.880
Please... Don't do it.

363
00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.470
But this guy's soccer career would end.

364
00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:05.430
No. I have to do it. 
That's how things work here.

365
00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:09.390
If there are winners. 
there must also be losers.

366
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:15.900
Making my dream come true 
means ending someone else's.

367
00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:28.660
Huh?

368
00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:31.620
That's not right.

369
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.670
If I don't change. 
I'll still be the same person.

370
00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.720
I came here to change my life.

371
00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.470
I came here to become 
the best in the world.

372
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:49.680
Unless I beat someone stronger
 than me. nothing will change!

373
00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.980
I like you.

374
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:55.350
You're right. If you're 
gonna beat someone...

375
00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.610
...it should be the strongest one here.

Someone once said:

"In the world of soccer."

382
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:24.930
"you can train first-rate goalkeepers. 
defenders. and midfielders."

383
00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.850
"but strikers are different."

384
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:36.440
"A first-rate striker will find 
where the soccer is most intense..."

385
00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.730

386
00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:40.730
Boom!

387
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:52.080

got chosen by the JFU. Yoichi.

I guess.

451
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:58.190
You even asked Santa Claus for 
the World Cup trophy for Christmas.

452
00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:02.500
and you've always dreamed of 
becoming the world's greatest striker.

453
00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.600
You can stop now. It's embarrassing.

454
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:10.180
You were glued to the TV 
whenever a soccer game was on.

455
00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:13.140
And you'd cry your eyes out 
if we switched the channel.

456
00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:15.650
I want to check the news.

457
00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:18.220
No!

458
00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:22.790
Yup. that's how it was. When you
 stopped crying. you'd fall asleep.

459
00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:25.480
and when you woke up. 
you didn't remember a thing.

460
00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:30.190
And you used to forget to do
your homework all the time.

461
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:33.280
That's why his grades
weren't very good. right?

462
00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:37.350
Yup. you were very lucky
 you got picked. Yoichi.

463
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:38.350
Isn't he just?

464
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:41.850
Wait. were you dissing me at the end there?
