1
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.700
One more goal.

2
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.760
We score this. we win!

3
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.630
Defend! We stop this. we win!

4
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.590
This is our last chance.

5
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.860
I can see it. I can feel it.

6
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.020
The ones on the move...

7
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.340
are me and these three!

8
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.300
This line of three smells like a goal.

9
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.230
With my eyes and powers of foresight.
 I will lead us to the goal!

10
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.940
This counter will be the last play!

11
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.110
If they take the ball. it's game over!

12
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.320
I won't let them get it. even if it kills me!

13
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.370
Go. Bachira!

14
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.160
Slice through their lines
with your uninhibited dribbling!

15
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.670
They'll try to stop us 
even if it means fouling.

16
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.880
Bachira. over here!

17
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.180
We won't let the ball stop moving. 
We'll just find another route.

18
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.590
I can see it.

19
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.400
Outrun 'em all with 
those legs of yours. Chigiri!

20
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.940
We need more people!

21
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.950
So they're wary of me. huh?

22
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:30.650
Chigiri!

23
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.110
You always take up good positions.

24
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.490
Let's cut through them! You and me!

25
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.200
Prevent the one-two!

26
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.950
He's going down the middle?

27
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.280
Did he use me as bait 
and carry on by himself?

28
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.250
Just how I imagined it. 
This'll work. I can control the field.

29
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.210
I'm going to score. no matter what!

30
00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.850
My body just reacted back then. 
It wasn't because I wanted to help you guys.

31
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.600
I felt like there was 
something more important...

32
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.620
than just doing nothing and winning.

33
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.650
Isn't that enough?

34
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.430
Kuon. you're overbearing.

35
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.970
Are you watching this. 
the old me from those days?

36
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.600
The soccer you believed in back then...

37
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.580
It's right here.

38
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.800
Go!

39
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.340
Two more defenders.

40
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.980
Kunigami and I will crush them!

41
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.470
If we can get past them. 
it's just the goalie left!

42
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.470
Zantetsu?!

43
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.890
He's faster than I anticipated!

44
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.730
No mid-range shot for you!

45
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.440
All right! It came off Kunigami last!

46
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.230
If the ball goes out. we're done!

47
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.440
Crap!

48
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.780
Raichi?!

49
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.160
That guy? How much stamina does he have?

50
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
I told you to score. didn't I?!

51
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.240
I'll kill you!

52
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.630
Go. you idiot!

53
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:13.960
Bachira!

54
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.790
Come on!

55
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:16.890
Pass it to me!

56
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.460
Watch out down the middle!

57
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.130
Don't let him shoot! Snap him!

58
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.800
I can see it.

59
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.020
Chigiri and Kunigami's routes...

60
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.300
Those defenders will go to block them off.

61
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.870
The far side...

62
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.150
Left of goal. 19 meters out.

63
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.520
That's the territory 
that'll make my goal possible!

64
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.160
Come on. Bachira!

65
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.650
I know you can see it. too!

66
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.480
I'll mark their Number 9!

67
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.990
Feel what I'm feeling!

68
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.350
I trust you. Isagi.

69
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.250
I'm betting on you 
to score with this last shot.

70
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.660
Perfect. Bachira.

71
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.580
All I need to do is 
control it and fire it home.

72
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.980
I can do this!

73
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.420
I will...

74
00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.460
We will...

75
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.390
We meet often. don't we?

76
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.230
That goal chance I could 
smell disappeared?!

77
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.220
What's this monster doing here?

78
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.110
Right now. you're the most 
dangerous person on this field.

79
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.480
What do I do?

80
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.220
I need to make a decision!

81
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.110
I can get to where it'll drop 
one second before him.

82
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.790
I can touch the ball first.

83
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.060
Which means how I control 
this ball will decide everything!

84
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.880
He cut inside?

85
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.380
If I slow down. he'll circle 
around and block the shot.

86
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.930
Taking it down normally won't work.

87
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.850
I have to pull off some supreme ball control
 that'll allow me to shoot while at top speed!

88
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.560
Can I even do something like that?

89
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.480
If it goes wrong. 
it's game over for all of us!

90
00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.660
It's no good.

91
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.640
I can't conjure an image of the goal.

92
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.820
I can see the future of this field...

93
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.790
But it's not a future where we win!

94
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.040
You can't beat me.

95
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.290
Shut up!

96
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.750
Over here. Isagi!

97
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.040
Pass it to me!

98
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.320
No!

99
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.500
I want to...

100
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.960
I want to win with my goal!

101
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.200
My goal?

102
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.530
That's right. Isagi.

103
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.720
Remember.

104
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.070
Remember your goal.

105
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.650
I see. Now I can see it.

106
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.400
You're so inefficient.

107
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.830
My mind got caught up in
 how to control the ball.

108
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.120
The time spent taking the ball down
made my future self a nobody.

109
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.580
That won't do!

110
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.830
That's always been the case.

111
00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:01.020
I have no speed. no power. no technique.
But the reason I'm here at Blue Lock...

112
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:59.670
Spatial Awareness

113
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:59.670
Spatial Awareness

114
00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.880

Spatial Awareness

143
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.180
something that gives no one time 
to catch up to the future I'm in...

144
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.400
My direct shot!

145
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.510
This is my formula for goals.

146
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.410
This is the moment Isagi Yoichi awakens!

147
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.720
Team Z
BL Ranking

148
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.720
th

149
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.970
Episode 11

150
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.970
The Final Piece

151
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.890
Yeah!

152
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.530
Nicely done!

153
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.500
You can't be serious.

154
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.500
Damn it!

155
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.450
I... lost?

156
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:40.120
We...

157
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:40.950
Reo!

158
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:42.830
We still have time.

159
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:45.250
Nagi. you...

160
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.750
If we score two more goals. we can still...

161
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.410
Full time.

162
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.430
Team Z wins. 5-4.

163
00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:58.760
Hey. Reo.

164
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:05.740
This is how it feels to lose 
after a serious fight. isn't it?

165
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.010
It's hard to stomach.

166
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.070
All right!

167
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.150
Yeah!

168
00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:11.480
Those guys...

169
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.880
They really did it.

170
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.030
Hey. Kuon.

171
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.010
What are you doing? Come join us.

172
00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:19.870
Huh? No. I...

173
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.330
Why not? We won.

174
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:23.160
So...

175
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.750
Don't go forgivin' him so easily.
 ya wannabe hero.

176
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:29.590
He's still a traitor. 
and I ain't lettin' him off the hook.

177
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.210
But y'know...

178
00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.880
If ya hadn't flattened Nagi.
 we wouldn't have won.

179
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.630
So yeah...

180
00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.470
C'mere. traitor.

181
00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.700
I'm gonna hate ya for the rest of my life!

182
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.280
That's for betraying us. and we're even now. 
Y'hear. ya piece of trash?!

183
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.740
You with me. guys?!

184
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.070
Yeah!

185
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.500
Woo!

186
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:01.560
Man. talk about self-centered.

187
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.540
Come on. Let's head back.

188
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.410
Right.

189
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.290
All of Building 5's matches
 have been completed.

190
00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.820
We will now announce the 
results of the first selection.

191
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:19.310
The results of the five-team 
round robin are as follows:

192

201
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:30.420
And the top scorers of the disqualified

202
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:35.940
Wanima Junichi

Barou Shouei

205
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:35.940
These 25 players advance to 
Building 5's second Blue Lock selection.

206
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.950
Yeah!

207
00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:42.160
We all survived!

208
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.260
Yum!

209
00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.960
Hey! You're nibbling 
at the food again. Naruhaya.

210
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.410
Take that!

211
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:56.380
Stop messing around and help us get 
things ready for the celebration party!

212
00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.500
Here it comes!

213
00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.690
Yeah. you guys.

214
00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.630
You're eating early. too.

215
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.050
Can someone grab some
 drinks from the cafeteria?

216
00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:03.220
Okay!

217
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.810
Let's go. Bachira.

218
00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.450
Think this is enough?

219
00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:08.790
It should be plenty.

220
00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:10.820
Oh. yeah.

221
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.520
Thanks for that last pass. Bachira.

222
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.940
I couldn't have done it without you.

223
00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.530
What are you talking about?
 I'm not the one who did something awesome.

224
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:20.240
Huh?

225
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:23.450
I know you. Isagi.

226
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.710
You learned something. didn't you?

227
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.150
Yeah.

228
00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:34.500
I think I finally understand what 
my weapon is and where my talents lie.

229
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:38.380
Even if I predict a situation 
using my spatial awareness.

230
00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:43.750
that advantage gets canceled out
 if I control the ball before shooting.

231
00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:48.100
So I thought back to my other goals.

232
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:48.930
Positioning Through Spatial Awareness

233
00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:49.980
Positioning Through Spatial Awareness

234
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:53.900
That's when I realized all of
my goals have been direct shots.

235
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.640
Direct Shots

236
00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.390
Isagi Yoichi's Formula for Goals

239
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.580
I took what I'd been doing by feel
 and turned it into a formula.

240
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.610
It feels like my time as 
Isagi Yoichi the striker begins now.

241
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.830
Oh. sorry. I didn't mean 
to sound so full of myself.

242
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.610
I like that look on your face. Very egoistic!

243
00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:12.580
Egoistic?

244
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.920
Get our blood pumping even more.
 Isagi Yoichi the egoist.

245
00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.880
Sure thing. Same to you.

246
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.800
Chop!

247
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.460
Ouch!

248
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.740
Did you just...

249
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:30.730
My dream...

250
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.370
Damn it. Damn it!

251
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:41.610
I nearly forgot. You're forced
 to leave Blue Lock if you lose.

252
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:44.260
It's all over for them.

253
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.570
Congratulations on advancing.

254
00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.950
It's been a while.

255
00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.470
Niko.

256
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.250
Team Y

257
00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:55.280
I survived. too.

258
00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.250
As Team Y's top scorer.

259
00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.640
Right. Congrats.

260
00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:01.670
That game...

261
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:04.800
I lost because of your goal.
 and it awakened me.

262
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.300
Instead of restraining myself 
and passing to others.

263
00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.180
I switched my style 
and took shots myself.

264
00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:15.570
Thanks to your goal. 
I'm still here at Blue Lock.

265
00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:17.520
I won't lose next time.

266
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.650
I'll be the one who crushes you.

267
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:31.580
I'm also here because you were there 
at that moment in that game. Niko.

268
00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:34.990
Bring it on anytime.

269
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.610
I'll beat you again next time.

270
00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.540
Screw you.

271
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.880
You're getting popular. Isagi.

272
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.820
How many rivals is that now?

273
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.460
My goal put an end to someone's career.

274
00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.970
But it also spurred on someone else.

275
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.950
I want to win more!

276
00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.410
More and more!

277
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.650
Sorry for the wait. 
We're back with the drinks.

278
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.110
Hm?

279
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.950
Give me the ball.

280
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:17.910
That night. we went to sleep 
savoring the taste of victory.

281
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.920
Team Z advances to the second selection

282
00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:30.590
Starting today. you will be 
doing some physical conditioning.

283
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:35.220
For the duration of this training. 
you are not allowed to kick a ball.

284
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.440
Huh?! We're not going straight
 into the second selection?!

285
00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.490
How long will this training take?

286
00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:42.860
Yeah. We need to know.

287
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:47.850
Building 5 is the bottom of the pile. so don't 
get cocky over surviving that tournament.

288
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:51.160
You'll train until I say stop. 
you pieces of garbage.

289
00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.290
What's that?

290
00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:55.000
It's kind of neo-futuristic.

291
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.950
Those in the top buildings were
 exempt from the first selection.

292
00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:00.000
and did state-of-the-art training instead.

293
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.200
So you have to wait 
until they've finished up.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:03.960

Eight more sprints...

312
00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.320
Hey. are you okay. Isagi-kun?

The first selection is now complete.

321
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.290
Those who have passed. 
put on your training gear.

322
00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.140
It's finally done.

323
00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.290
Phew. finally!

324
00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:07.710
and come to the central basement area
 of your building immediately.

325
00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:09.400
I repeat...

326
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.450
Took those bastards long enough.

327
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:15.070
If it'd taken a day longer. 
I woulda trashed the whole damn place.

328
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:19.830
I'm with you. I'm gonna take away the status of
 the higher-ranked players who've had it easy.

329
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.320
All right. Amen!

330
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.830
What's so great about being 
ranked higher anyway. huh?

331
00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:26.490
I finally get to touch the ball again.

332
00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.790
The second selection starts now.

333
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:29.880
We're gonna win!

334
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.820
Let's go. you guys!

335
00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.760
From here on out. we'll be fighting 
against higher-ranked players.

336
00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:38.350
But I'm not scared at all.

337
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:41.680
I'm excited to try out my skills!

338
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:43.180
Bring it on.

339
00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.420
I'll crush 'em all!

340
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.680
They're from the other buildings.

341
00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.870
Wait. don't they look kinda beat?

342
00:16:58.590 --> 00:16:59.580
Huh?

343
00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.600
Team W? Rank 237?

344
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.250
What?

345
00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.960
And that's Team X over there? 
What's going on?

346
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:10.170
Hello there. diamonds in the rough.

347
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.880
Good work on your physical conditioning.

348
00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.740
If you're astute. you might 
have already noticed.

349
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:20.210
There are no players from 
Buildings 1. 2. 3. or 4 in here.

350
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:24.410
That's because only 
Building 5 exists in Blue Lock.

351
00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:25.190
What?

352
00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:30.120
You all believed you were
the very bottom of the pile.

353
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.150
1

354
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.150
1

355
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.150

356
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.150

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.150

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.150

359
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.150

360
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.150

361
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.150
5

362
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.150
5

363
00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:34.240
and battled through the first selection 
filled with stupid desperation.

364
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.820
1

365
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.820

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.820

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:32.320

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.730

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.730

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.240

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.240

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.240

390
00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.240
5

391
00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.240
5

392
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:37.180
Seriously?! Screw you.

393
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.490
You put us through all that crazy 
training! You tryin' to kill us?!

394
00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.490
You lied to us?

395
00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.230
Yup. that's right.

396
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.660
It was all a ruse I set up to destroy
 your half-baked confidence.

397
00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:49.170
and give you the hunger to 
become the best in the world.

398
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.490
What the hell. man?!

399
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.490
Don't insult us!

400
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.130
We're not your toys!

401
00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:53.160
Idiots.

402
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.340
I'm calling those sentiments half-baked.

403
00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.090
Listen.

404
00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:59.930
Let's take Noel Noa as an example.

405
00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:03.330
He's currently considered 
the best striker in the world.

406
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.100
but he grew up in a slum in France.

407
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.610
Surrounded by crime and poverty.

408
00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:11.870
the only way to change
 his fate was with a ball.

409
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:15.110
Soccer was literally his only option.

410
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.880
There are countless strikers with
 similar stories all around the world.

411
00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.490
Their hunger for goals is immeasurable.

412
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:28.180
Since you were all born and raised in Japan.
 where losing doesn't affect your life.

413
00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:32.180
you will never know the level of 
hunger for goals these players have.

414
00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.550
Blue Lock exists to give that to you.

415
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:39.970
In fact. you all came here wanting to kick 
the butts of those ranked above you.

416
00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:43.430
believing you could win. Am I right?

417
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:47.390
That hunger will become 
the ego that changes the world.

418
00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.190
I... I want to test myself right now!

419
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.490
We will begin Blue Lock's second selection.

420
00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:02.410
The first selection was about finding 
what it means to be a striker.

421
00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:04.090
and turning zero into one.

422
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:08.200
From here on. it'll be a battle
 of multiplying that one into 100

423
00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.060
on this cutting-edge training field.

424
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:14.680
The second selection 
consists of five stages.

425
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:22.090
You are here

426
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:22.090
You are here

427
00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:19.100
Only those who clear a stage 
get to move on to the next one.

428
00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.090
And those who pass the second selection

429
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:27.220
will participate in a training camp with the
 world's top players that I have handpicked.

430
00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.930
Wow.

431
00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:32.640
That's all I have for you.

432
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.480
When you are ready. 
go through the gate one at a time.

433
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.230
One at a time?

434
00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.110
Not together?

435
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:43.760
Naturally. the difficulty spike from 
the last selection to this one is huge.

436
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:48.260
If you survived the last round because you 
got lucky with teammates. prepare yourself.

437
00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:51.710
In the second selection. 
the trash will be sifted out first.

438
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:54.810
Only the true egoists will remain.

439
00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:56.220
Best of luck to you.

440
00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:01.960
From here on. we're fighting alone.

441
00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.190
You can go first.

442
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:05.610
What? No way!

443
00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:07.720
Everyone's hanging back.

444
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:10.680
Oh.

445
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.140
He's going.

446
00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:19.980
What a clean kick into a high. gentle arc.

447
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.910
Now a low-arcing shot 
with curve and spin?

448
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:26.820
What?

449
00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:28.910
What?

450
00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:30.660
Is he for real?

451
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.470
Holy crap. He's amazing.

452
00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.150
Open the door.

453
00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:37.880
I'm done with my warm-up.

454
00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.180
Itoshi Rin?

455
00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.140
New Generation World's Best 11

456
00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.140
Itoshi Sae (18)

457
00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:49.140
Of the New Generation World's Best 11?

458
00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.800
No. that's Itoshi Sae. isn't it?

459
00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.700
Then. who the hell is this guy?

460
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.490
Is this place swarming with 
unreal monsters like him?

461
00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.030
Remember what happened against Team V.

462
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.490
We're also unreal. aren't we?

463
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:05.010
That's true.

464
00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:07.510
My face block was unreal.

465
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.160
No. my shots were more unreal.

466
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.030
Nah. man. my dribbling
 was even more unreal.

467
00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:17.250
That's bull. If it weren't for my legs.
 we would have lost.

468
00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:20.990
Huh? It was because I had
 the midfield locked down!

469
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:22.760
My defense was unreal. too!

470
00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.300
I-I also did my bit defending 
with that red card!

471
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.900
Yeah. no. That's a bit different.

472
00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.510
I contributed. too. Like. a lot.

473
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:33.930
Don't forget my super save!

474
00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:35.600
My goal was unreal.

475
00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.190
I'm gonna be the best in the world.

476
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:39.650
We are unreal!

477
00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:42.260
Let's meet again on the 
other side of Blue Lock!

478
00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.440
Yeah!

479
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.390
Thank you. you guys.

480
00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.850
I got this far because of you.

481
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:59.140
From here on. I have to proceed alone.

482
00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:03.630
But somehow. I'm excited.

483
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.620
This isn't the undefined 
thrill I've felt up to now.

484
00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:14.040
This is an exhilaration grounded in the 
results of the games I've played so far.

485
00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.020
This must be what "confidence" feels like.

486
00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:22.570
Okay. let's see what's waiting for me.

487
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:27.880
At Blue Lock. I can grow even stronger.

488
00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.130
A

489
00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:17.910
Blue Lock. Additional Time.

490
00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:15.290
Additional Time!

491
00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:15.500
Additional Time!

492
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:15.710
Additional Time!

493
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:15.920
Additional Time!

494
00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:16.750
Additional Time!

495
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:16.960
Additional Time!

496
00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:16.840
Blue Lock

497
00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:16.880
Blue Lock

498
00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:16.920
Blue Lock

499
00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:16.960
Blue Lock

500
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:17.170
Blue Lock

501
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:17.170
