Bachira-kun.

2
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.990
Hm?

3
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.000
U-Uh. if possible. I'd like you 
to hit a pass or two to me. too...

4
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.930
Th-That was too bold of me. 
wasn't it? Forgive me.

5
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.460
Keep it coming my way.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.820
I will score glam goals 
and win the game for us.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.100
'Kay.

10
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.180
Hey. Let's get this over 
with quickly and move on.

11
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.890
Instant kill.

12
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.900
Sure thing.

13
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.850
Let's go play...

14
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.110

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.260
Aryu-kun?

38
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.260
What do you use on your hair?

39
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.470
Huh?

40
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.930
Just the stuff in the communal 
bath. like everyone else.

41
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.690
But your cuticles are way too glam.

42
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.090
You must have natural-born glam.

43
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.230
Don't touch my hair.

44
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.000
Oh. sorry. Your hair's just too beautiful.

45
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.500
I obey the laws of glam.

46
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.120
It's an honor to be taking on
 a fellow member of the glam fam.

47
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.710
Nice to meet you. Chigiri Hyoma.

48
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.670
He's so tall.

49
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.280
So this is who I'm matched up with. huh?

50
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.840
You have rather a classical-sounding
 name. in spite of how you look.

51
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.540
Nice to meet you. Aryu Jyubei-san.

52
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.470
Don't call me that! 
That first name is totally not glam!

53
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.940
It oozes with the unmistakable 
outdatedness of a Warring States samurai.

54
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.520
It is my only complex.

55
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.930
Let me erase all thought of it
 with some glam poses!

56
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.210
Ah. stop. Aryu-kun!

57
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.340
GLAM

58
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.340
GLAM

59
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.990
If you move around too much. 
you'll use up all your energy!

60
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.940
H-Hey. Isagi. are you sure
 these guys are strong?

61
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.940
Aryu-kun? What is it?

62
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.850
Yeah. they're really good at soccer.

63
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.330
Are you okay? You're still stylish. Aryu-kun!

64
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.210
Shut up. all of you!

65
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.290
Get into your formation 
already and let's do this.

66
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.500
Yikes! I'm sorry!

67
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.270
U-Um. do you think we could take a rain check?

68
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.070
Huh?

69
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.800
Well. Aryu-kun's in a state. 
so let's wait till we're all at our best—

70
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.900
Overruled.

71
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.800
Get in position or I'll kill you.

72
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.800
Ah. we're done for. This is the end.

73
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.610
An authoritative guy like him
 will end up running society.

74
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.420
Confident people will always win
 and live happily ever after.

75
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.170
They don't even know our pain.

76
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.660
They just keep winning
 without suffering any setbacks.

77
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.850
Isagi. we're changing formation.

78
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.210
I'm gonna end this super-negative shithead.

79
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.220
Who exactly hasn't
 suffered setbacks? Huh?!

80
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.120
Oh man. you're terrifying!

81
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.970
I can't budge him?

82
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.060
Is he some kind of super strong herbivore?

83
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.520
Okay. In that case. could you switch 
positions with Barou... Um. Nagi?

84
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.950
Sorry. Isagi. But can I make a request. too?

85
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.820
Huh?

86
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.010
I have to do something that excites me.
Otherwise. not choosing Reo was pointless.

87
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.700
I want to play against the number one.

88
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.090
I want to become stronger.

89
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.870
Okay.

90
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.390
But if you lose. I'll crush you myself.

91
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.400
I'll be the one who devours
everything on this field.

92
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.510
So. with that sorted...

93
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.430
Let's do this. Bachira.

94
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.730
Bachira

95
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.730
Bachira

96
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.730
Aryu

97
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.730
Aryu

98
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.730
Tokimitsu

99
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.730
Tokimitsu

100
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.730
Rin

101
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.730
Rin

102
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.730
Nagi

103
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.730
Nagi

104
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.730
Isagi

105
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.730
Isagi

106
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.730
Barou

107
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.730
Barou

108
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.730
Chigiri

109
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.730
Chigiri

110
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.310
Put everything on the line.

111
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.360
Throw everything at him.

112
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.600
The winner...

113
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.240
will be me!

114
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.430
Are you ready. Isagi?

115
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.690
Let's start with...

116
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.380
Ultra-fast scissors. cranked up to the max?

117
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.090
Just try and take it.

118
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.340
One backward false step...

119
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.050
and a quick turn!

120
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.980
What? I used to be able to 
shake him with that move.

121
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.110
What happened? Did he read it?

122
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.390
He's looking around the 
whole field to position himself.

123
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.110
He's not just focused on our one-on-one.

124
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.610
He's stopping me from going 
the way he doesn't want me to go.

125
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.360
Nagi's on that side. so they can recover
 if Isagi's slow to defend.

126
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.320
But on this side. there's no one behind. 
so if I run past him. I'm through on goal.

127
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.830
He matched up with me. knowing this was
 the most critical point in their defense.

128
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.450
His assessment of the situation in 
the moment is on a whole new level!

129
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.290
What's up. Bachira? Try and run past me.

130
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.360
I see that how you use your eyes has evolved.

131
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.760
In that case. I'll gamble...

132
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.220
on attacking down this side!

133
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.960
Figured you would.

134
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.570
I'll take that. Blunt Bangs.

135
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.280
Barou?

136
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.770
He read my movement and 
came to double up on me with Isagi?

137
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.020
Bachira-kun. hit it back here!

138
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.500
If I must.

139
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.400
Huh?

140
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.990
Thanks.

141
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.990
Isagi?

142
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.990
Damn it!

143
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.320
Move. bastard!

144
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.450
Huh? What are they doing?

145
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.540
I thought they'd positioned 
themselves to work in combination.

146
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.350
But they used the other one and 
devoured them while competing for the ball?

147
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.840
Link-up devouring? It's an anti-combo!

148
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.300
How am I supposed to 
read that on first sight?

149
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.010
Float one over.

150
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.760
I know just where you want it.

151
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.460
A slice. Nice ball.

152
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:37.180
Hm?

153
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:42.140
So he's not rushing in 
because he's wary of my first touch.

154
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.980
I'm not a fan of the awkward 
amount of space he's giving me.

155
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:52.200
If I knock it forward without slowing.
 he has time to react.

156
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.380
If I stop the ball here. 
he only has to take a step and he's on me.

157
00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.410
What superb positioning.

158
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:03.920
All it took was one game for you to be able
 to read my game this well. Itoshi Rin?

159
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.790
That's a genius for you.

160
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.530
Now. what should I do?

161
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.470
You feeling this? 
It's the only spot available...

162
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.670
Red Panther.

163
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.720
Bring it on. I'll run past everyone!

164
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.930
That was a very glam pass.

165
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.680
If I gauge the distance of Aryu and Rin. 
with me running at top speed...

166
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.520
In that split second before we all collide...

167
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.440
That's the coordinates of my one 
and only chance to smash through!

168
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.110
Whoa. Are these guys for real?

169
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.200
They seized the ball through
the anti-combo of Isagi and Barou.

170
00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:43.540
And the moment they got it. Isagi and
 Nagi instantly shared the same vision.

171
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:48.330
Nagi responded by taking it down 
superbly and hitting a killer pass.

172
00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.920
And Chigirin's legs were 
able to react to all of it.

173
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.160
This is the chemical reaction 
they've come up with to beat us.

174
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.590
Isagi
Yoichi

175
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.590
Barou
Shouei

176
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.300
This super link-up play!

177
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.300
Isagi
Yoichi

178
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.300
Barou
Shouei

179
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.300
Nagi
Seishiro

180
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.300
Chigiri
Hyoma

181
00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.720
They are truly worthy opponents.

182
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.390
All right!

183
00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.480
Nice one. missy.

184
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.610
Yes!

185
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.330
I've been waiting for you. egoist.

186
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.250
The monster inside me is over the moon.

187
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.350
It's 35 meters to the goal.

188
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.850
Even for Rin. that's not a
distance he can shoot from.

189
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.330
And yet...

190
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.600
Is it just me or have they gotten stronger?

191
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.170
The glam in my veins is all aquiver.

192
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.130
There's no way the Top Three
will allow it to end here!

193
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:40.090
But we'll keep on attacking 
so they get no time to rest.

194
00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:41.220
We are...

195
00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.220
the challengers!

196
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.880
Let's do this. Isagi.

197
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.640
It won't make it so easy this time.

198
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.650
Silky dribbling while 
keeping one eye on Barou...

199
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.150
It's impossible to take the ball off
 Bachira when he's on the move.

200
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.570
Down the wing? Aryu?

201
00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.360
No. we'll be fine.

202
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.040
Nagi's in our half and 
Chigiri's tracking back.

203
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.140
It's only an issue if he gets past me. 
We can handle everything else.

204
00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.560
Blunt Bangs!

205
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.700
He stopped dribbling?

206
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.490
Nice one. Barou. Now we can steal it.

207
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.690
Huh? A no-look pass?

208
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.230
It got through! Aryu-kun!

209
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.010
Run!

210
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.240
Get it. missy!

211
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.300
That reach is practically cheating.

212
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.990
Don't make me laugh. 
This airspace is my territory.

213
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.690
And all I need to do is to release it...

214
00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:32.860
before you catch up!

215
00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.340
I-It's here! M-My ball!

216
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.940
No. it's my ball. you musclebound dumpling!

217
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.520
It's the scary gorilla man!

218
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.950
Who you calling a gorilla?

219
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:44.580
This guy...

220
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.700
Even with my strength. I can't budge him?

221
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.200
I hate this!

222
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.790
Is his core super strong?

223
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:50.860
There!

224
00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.000
A one-touch pass? But to who?

225
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:55.610
Crap!

226
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.910
That's inside Rin's shooting range!

227
00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.800
No. I'm here.

228
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.270
I won't let him.

229
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:03.220
Nagi!

230
00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.890
Are you just gonna blast it?

231
00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.860
Nagi's seen through it. There shouldn't
 be any routes for the shot now.

232
00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.100
No! That's exactly why this will work.

233
00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:14.540
A fake shot!

234
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.050
He lured Nagi in.

235
00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.370
Rin's one step ahead.

236
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.150
But with the time that took him...

237
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.120
I can catch up!

238
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.380
Nice covering. Isagi!

239
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.630
We'll double up on him!

240
00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:26.810
Chigiri. nice!

241
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:28.370
Now it's two against one.

242
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.290
Bachira?

243
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.790
Crap. Now it's two-on-two!

244
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.710
Will he pass or dribble?

245
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.320
He's gonna shoot it between us?
 Talk about getting greedy!

246
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.500
No. you're wrong.

247
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.220
This is a fake out. too!

248
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:47.930
He didn't give us time to think 
after it became a two-on-two.

249
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.730
Tch. it's no good.

250
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:53.190
Everyone on the field's being manipulated 
according to Rin's master plan!

251
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:58.400
Shooting. dribbling. situational 
awareness. an eye for strategy...

252
00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:03.660
Rin is a monster who can create 
limitless variations by himself.

253
00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.450
without needing any chemical reactions!

254
00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:08.950
He's on a whole other level!

255
00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:10.120
Damn it!

256
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:15.800
Huh. Looks like you finally learned 
how to use your eyes on the field of play.

257
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.750
But playing half-baked soccer like that...

258
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.180
will never make my heart dance.

259
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:32.360
Seriously. how are we 
supposed to stop that?

260
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:37.560
No. We might not have 
stopped it. but we were close.

261
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:41.820
In the last match. I couldn't 
even grasp why we lost.

262
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:46.540
But this time. I understood the logic 
behind every move Rin made.

263
00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.090
If I devour him. I can win!

264
00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.380
Think.

265
00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:07.090
Come up with a way to neutralize 
Rin and take control the field.

266
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.330
N-Nice goal!

267
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:14.060
I'm giving you one glam point
 for that jumping shot.

268
00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.960
Are you kidding me? 
I had no idea Rin was that good.

269
00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.940
Sorry. I couldn't stop him at all.

270
00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.680
But how does he even make a play like that?

271
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.490
Maybe his thinking is 
just simply next level?

272
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.780
No. I can explain why he 
managed to get past you.

273
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:31.580
In that play just now...

274
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:36.390
Rin positioned himself to receive 
the ball within his shooting range.

275
00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:41.750
We lost the initiative because all we could
 think about was how to react to that.

276
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.340
Predict the future of the 
field a few steps ahead.

277
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.240
and pull us in by making us 
unable to think for ourselves.

278
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:52.180
That's likely Rin's standard operating spec.

279
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:56.060
Man. I don't know if my operating 
system can keep up with that.

280
00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.850
But you know. Isagi...

281
00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:04.360
Your spec must also be pretty out there if 
you can instantly analyze Rin's play like that.

282
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.200
Huh?

283
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.070
I see.

284
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.240
So I'm the only one on this field who can 
keep up with how Rin's mind works?

285
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.950
Then. the only things that can stop him...

286
00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.150
are my eyes and brain!

287
00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.700
It's still 1-1. Come on!

288
00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.810
Yes. our attack works.

289
00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:25.960
The counterattack...

290
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.220
starts here.

291
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:28.970
Okay.

292
00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.810
Against Aryu and his long reach. 
should we take him on or bypass him?

293
00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:35.640
But...

294
00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:40.370
Rin's taken up a position where he can 
respond to whatever Chigiri chooses to do.

295
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.400
Though that leaves Nagi free.

296
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.440
Bachira can't mark both 
Nagi and me by himself!

297
00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.290
The moment everyone targets Nagi...

298
00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.530
Run behind and emerge from the blind spot!

299
00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.750
Notice me. Chigiri! Pass it here!

300
00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:58.960
Nice. That's perf—

301
00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.630
Is he serious?

302
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.840
He read my off-the-ball 
movements perfectly!

303
00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.510
Damn it!

304
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.420
So my movement was part 
of his calculations. too?

305
00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.720
He must be seeing the same
 vision of the field as me! But...

306
00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:18.850
Rin gets there one step before me!

307
00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:21.060
I won't let you.

308
00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.810
Stop showing off. brat.

309
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:26.570
Oh? You're passing it to me. Rin-chan?

310
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.090
Now take the ball toward the goal.

311
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:30.780
Yessir! Aye-aye. sir!

312
00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.410
Get back! It's a counter!

313
00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:33.080
Tch!

314
00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.160
Damn it!

315
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:39.610
Amazing. Isagi. You've improved so much.
you can even face Rin head-on.

316
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.360
No fair. I want in.

317
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.250
Lemme introduce some more...

318
00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.800
Shocking!

319
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.050
...ideas to this field!

320
00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.050
A shot? No...

321
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.760
It has backspin on it?

322
00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:58.060
It started off as a daisy cutter. 
then flew up. Is it a super-long pass?

323
00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:02.520
But it's not to Rin. Bachira's target is...

324
00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:04.350
Aryu!

325
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:08.810
Sublime vertical spin. Sheer poetry.

326
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:12.150
But Chigiri will catch up 
to him with his speed!

327
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.240
Hey. glam jackass. I'm gunning for you.

328
00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:17.120
I'm here. too. you know.

329
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.100
Nagi's also back in front of the goal.

330
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.120
Great.

331
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.540
Nagi can match Aryu for height.

332
00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.960
and Chigiri can get to where 
the ball will drop before he does!

333
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.920
This pass isn't getting through!

334
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.760
Notice it. Mr. Glam.

335
00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:34.260
See the line of the pass. 
instead of a dot on the field.

336
00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:36.220
I see.

337
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:42.020
If I wait for the ball to reach the end 
of its arc. someone else will get it.

338
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.840
That's why I must meet the ball
 in the middle of its arc.

339
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.400
Only I can reach...

340
00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:52.110
this midair end point!

341
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.110
Jumping already?

342
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.110
You're kidding me.

343
00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.600
I dance.

344
00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.040
Crap! This is the chemical reaction
 between Aryu and Bachira!

345
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.660
The Top Three who were only 
fighting individually before

346
00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.540
are now starting to link up as a team!

347
00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.300
I thought we could win if we stopped Rin.

348
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.510
Bachira's ideas are accelerating 
the evolution of this game.

349
00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.300
I'm grateful. Bachira Meguru.

350
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:26.260
Your pass led me to glam 
that I hadn't yet explored.

351
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.560
GLAM

352
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.560
GLAM

353
00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.340
My pleasure.

354
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.250
This is the final showdown!

355
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:32.970
What a game!

356
00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:36.250
This game is crazy.

357
00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:41.490
Isagi and Rin are going at it. 
battling for control over the field.

358
00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.550
On top of that. we have our 
hands full just dealing with Rin.

359
00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:50.890
but now his ideas are becoming the catalyst 
for the Top Three's chemical reactions!

360
00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.000
So half-baked.

361
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.590
Bleeding stemmed.

362
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:56.590
We came back to lead.

363
00:17:56.590 --> 00:18:01.250
Aw. man. Now they're more than 
just a team of individual skills.

364
00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.260
They're seriously strong.

365
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:07.520
Man. oh man...

366
00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:10.270
I really want to crush them!

367
00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.780
The only reason I can be so fired up...

368
00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:19.170
is because Reo introduced me
 to this world back then.

369
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:21.920
Hey. Reo.

370
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:26.100
Maybe you were right about me.

371
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:34.580
I came to Blue Lock. played soccer. 
learned defeat. and yes. I changed.

372
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:38.320
But I want to get stronger.

373
00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.280
I'm sorry. Reo.

374
00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.470
I'm sorry I'm not with you.

375
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.570
Nagi. we won't let them run away with it.

376
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:48.180
I'm sorry I'm changing without you.

377
00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.650
Let's devour them all.

378
00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:53.300
I'm sorry I'm fighting alongside Isagi.

379
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.980
Yeah.

380
00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.770
Please. for now. let me do this.

381
00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.370
We can do this all day.

382
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.280
We'll stop you every time.

383
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.330
Hey. Chigiri!

384
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:06.660
Pass me the ball!

385
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.970
No! You can't do that!

386
00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.040
Get lost!

387
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:15.150
Isagi's always looking 
for a pass from Chigiri.

388
00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.760
Plus the perfect position for his 
direct shot that even Rin can't touch

389
00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.250
by using Barou. who's constantly 
buzzing around Chigiri. as a decoy.

390
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.580
But Rin can see through that.

391
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:29.210
Quite frankly. I don't really 
know what those two are seeing.

392
00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.820
But maybe the level of vision 
they're seeing is the same.

393
00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:38.800
So the reason Isagi can't beat Rin is due 
to the differences in their physical skills.

394
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:42.820
Spatial Awareness

395
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:42.820
Spatial Awareness

396
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:42.820

Jumping

401
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:42.820
Jumping

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:42.820

409
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:42.820
Strength

410
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:42.820
Speed

411
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:42.820
Speed

412
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:42.820
Speed

413
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:42.820
Speed

414
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:42.370
That's why Isagi can't take that last step.

415
00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:44.200
In that case. I will be...

416
00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.530
the final piece!

417
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.200
Isagi. Rin.

418
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.620
The future of the field you two 
are envisioning and drawing...

419
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.080
I'm going to obliterate it!

420
00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.780
Come on. Try to respond.

421
00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:03.510
Don't assume I'm the type of person 
to stay within your expectations!

422
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:04.390
Nagi!

423
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:09.390
That was a quick response!
 I'm within reach for him.

424
00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.400
In that case. I'll leave it.

425
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.310
C'mon. Isagi. Read the battlefield situation!

426
00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.420
So that I can score a goal...

427
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.810
Redraw the future of 
this field in an instant!

428
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:25.980
Go direct behind Rin.

429
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.330
Perfect.

430
00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:29.290
Whoa. him again?

431
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.370
Even though it was a perfect pass. 
he read it and caught up. if just barely.

432
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:35.040
In that case...

433
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.470
I'll shoot!

434
00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.840
Or rather. I'll control it.

435
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.100
And then...

436
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.440
My two-stage fake volley!

437
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.500
Are you a god or something?

438
00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:57.810
With Isagi. there's no limit
 to how strong I can get.

439
00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:00.100
Sorry. Reo.

440
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:05.050
Now that I know how good this feels. 
I can't go back to how I was before.

441
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:07.950
What was that?

442
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:09.850
Big glam. that's what.

443
00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:13.010
They got you. Rin-chan.

444
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:15.620
Still think this is half-baked?

445
00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.130
Shut up. Bob Cut.

446
00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:26.320
I also get fired up when I'm frustrated.
