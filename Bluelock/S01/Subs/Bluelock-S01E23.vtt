00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.200
8 Seconds Ago

2
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.660
Rin. your positioning is perfect.

3
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.120
Before. at some point in his run. 
Bachira would've passed the ball.

4
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.590
You've placed yourself in the 
best position to receive that pass.

5
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.340
But now. he's changed.

6
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.590
I'll go devour him!

7
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.110
I believe in a future where an unpredictable
 Bachira outruns everyone on the field.

8
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.140
I'm the one who's been 
receiving his passes all this time.

9
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.100
so I can see the ego Bachira 
would never have chosen before.

10
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.320
At the very end of it all...

11
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.610
I believe in you. and that's why I win!

12
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.290
Isagi?

13
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.500
I knew you could do it. Bachira.

14
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.660
I knew you could get here all by yourself.

15
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.790
In that moment. Isagi Yoichi's play
 surpassed that of Itoshi Rin.

16
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.810
If his right foot that blocked Bachira 
Meguru's shot had been just a centimeter

17
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.990
either to the left or the right.

18
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.960
the fate of these eight people
 could have been different.

19
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.360
However. the ball randomly. mercilessly.

20
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.190
even cruelly landed at the feet...

21
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.150
of the winner.

22
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.750
Game over.

23
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.750
Final score: 5-4.

24
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.840
Team Red wins.

25
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.340
We did it!

26
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.010
I fought alone.

27
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.350
When believed I didn't
 need anyone anymore...

28
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.750
Why? Damn it... Why?

29
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.670
In this world where I stand alone...

30
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.840
you came to find me...

31
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.580
Isagi.

32
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.650
All right! We did it!

33
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.570
Hey. let me savor the glam aftermath.

34
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.930
Oh. sorry.

35
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.590
So who are we gonna pick?

36
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.340
Oh. yeah. right. Is it you and me
 doing the choosing again?

37
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.410
Wait. Hold on a second.

38
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.380
I can live without Isagi now.

39
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.210
That's why I can say this with confidence.

40
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.670
I want...

41
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.190
The guy I want is—

42
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.390
Shut up. I'll pick.

43
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.630
What?

44
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.640
Rin?

45
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.740
No objections allowed.

46
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.810
That last play just now...
I was totally unable to read it.

47
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.820
This is the first time I've felt 
defeated since I came here.

48
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.910
So there's now one more person 
I absolutely need to crush. damn it.

49
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.020
I won't let you sink back down.

50
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.300
Come. Isagi Yoichi.

51
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.680
You will watch me become the 
best in the world at my side.

52
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.970
Itoshi Rin
Aryu Jyubei
Tokimitsu Aoshi
Bachira Meguru
and
Isagi Yoichi

53
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.970
These Five Players
Have Cleared 
the 2nd Selection

54
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.980
Episode 23

55
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.360
Why was I picked?

56
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.390
Yet again. I wasn't able to beat Rin.

57
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.990
What should I have done?

58
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.200
What was I lacking?

59
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.070
No one could've known where 
that ball was going to land.

60
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.780
Is the difference between Rin 
and me just a little bit of luck?

61
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.760
Let's go. Isagi.

62
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.590
Huh? Oh. uh. right.

63
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.770
It's no good. I can't get my head 
around it. Being chosen after losing...

64
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.480
I'm sorry. guys.

65
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.400
We were this close to 
beating the "Top Three."

66
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.820
That last goal was pure luck. 
It's not like we got hammered—

67
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.780
Cut that crap out.

68
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.450
Rin chose you. That's the reality.

69
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.920
So just shut up and go on ahead.

70
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.830
For real.

71
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.510
If I have to look at your face any longer.
 I'll end up wanting to kill you.

72
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.880
So get lost already. donkey.

73
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.100
Yeah. man.

74
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.690
You were the main character 
on this team. after all.

75
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.350
We're paying the price for being 
the supporting cast right now.

76
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.670
When we meet next. I'll crush you. Isagi.

77
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.420
We'll crawl our way up without you.

78
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.780
If it wasn't for these guys. 
I wouldn't have made it this far.

79
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.070
It was seriously intense.

80
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.740
Nagi.

81
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.870
Barou.

82
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.030
Chigiri.

83
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.300
I'm proud to have fought alongside you.

84
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.920
You'd better catch up.

85
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.720
We'll play together again.

86
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.760
Damn it. Damn it!

87
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.980
I can't let it end like this.

88
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.720
Yeah. We'll have our revenge.

89
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.400
Nagi\h\h\hBarou\h\h\hChigiri

90
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.400
.

91
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.400
.

92
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.400
Move Back to the 3rd Stage

93
00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.450
G-Glad to have you on the team. Isagi-kun.

94
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.980
You're really something if 
Rin-kun wants you on our team.

95
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.880
Oh. but I was gonna pick you. too.

96
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.170
Um. thanks.

97
00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:00.280
To be honest. I would've picked
Chigiri Hyoma for the glam.

98
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.010
But that back-heel shot 
you scored was glam. too.

99
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.260
GLAM

100
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.260
GLAM

101
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.630
Welcome. Isagi Yoichi.

102
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.500
Um. thank you very much.

103
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.580
There's no need to be so formal!

104
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.220
Welcome to the "Top Three"!

105
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.810
Oh. I didn't mean to play the seniority card.
 Please don't think I'm abusing my position.

106
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.560
Your negativity shall be 
washed away by my glam.

107
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.560
GLAM

108
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.560
GLAM

109
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.270
Isagi.

110
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.610
You said you'd steal me back. 
but it ended up the other way around.

111
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.290
Yeah. Sorry about that.

112
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.830
I'm kinda lame. huh?

113
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.240
No. it's fine.

114
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.580
Being away from you meant
I can now fight on my own.

115
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.950
Up until now. I was afraid 
of playing soccer alone.

116
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.460
and I was hoping you'd 
save me from that fate.

117
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.260
But now that I've fought alone.

118
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.910
I've learned that the only one
 who can save me is me.

119
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.800
That's what I believed and forged ahead. 
and at the end of it. I found you.

120
00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.730
In that moment. we surpassed Rin for sure.

121
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.860
Thank you. Isagi.

122
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.610
Now that I can fight without you. 
being with you is even more fun.

123
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.660
But if you can't keep up with me. 
I won't hesitate to leave you behind.

124
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.290
Don't get too cocky.

125
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.790
Anyway. nice to be working with you.

126
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.630
Is it just me or does 
Bachira look more mature now?

127
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.880
Same.

128
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.510
Hi-yah!

129
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.050
Gotcha.

130
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.060
Damn you. Guess you 
haven't changed that much.

131
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:39.850
Hey. Rin.

132
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.650
Tell me something. Why did I lose to you?

133
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:44.860
Huh?

134
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.470
What was I lacking that 
I needed in order to beat you?

135
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.740
Even a monkey could answer that.

136
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:53.660
It was luck.

137
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.640
Now. wait a second. Something as 
uncertain as luck can't explain it.

138
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.000
I want something more 
concrete so I can get stronger!

139
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:06.300
Luck isn't just some coincidental factor.

140
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.670
It's the hidden element on the field 
that favors those who act on desire.

141
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.510
If you can't understand that.

142
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.380
you have no right to live in 
this world of victory and defeat.

143
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.970
Hello there. diamonds in the rough.

144
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:24.060
Congratulations on 
passing the second selection.

145
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:26.780
What is luck. huh?

146
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.020
Quite the cringe topic.

147
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.130
Now. proceed through the next door.

148
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.360
As a reward for passing the selection.

149
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:39.580
I'll tell you about how luck 
really works in the world of soccer.

150
00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:43.660
Luck is luck. It's basically 
just coincidence. right?

151
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:48.380
Well. sure. that's how average Joes 
on the losing side interpret it.

152
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.850
their tiny brains bending the truth to fit.

153
00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:51.400
Wha—

154
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.890
Shut up and listen.

155
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.090
Let me ask you a question.

156
00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.300
Have you ever been shat on by a pigeon?

157
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.600
It's the worst. right?

158
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.060
But when its droppings 
land on you. you realize...

159
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.560
the ground's covered in bird shit.

160
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.250
and if you look up. there are
a bunch of pigeons above you.

161
00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.500
So can you call it bad luck 
when you could've avoided the shit

162
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.840
if you'd noticed those things sooner?

163
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.960
What is this about?

164
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.750
Luck. Or muck. I guess.

165
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.210
Here's another question.

166
00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.850
Take a lottery at a summer festival.

167
00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.540
Fun Puzzle Game
Life with Horse and Land

168
00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:34.550
Try your luck

169
00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:34.550
Lottery

170
00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:34.550
1 draw = 500 yen

171
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:28.280
Aw. too bad. Here's your consolation prize.

172
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.190
If the stall owner doesn't 
put in a winning number.

173
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:34.550
can we really say the person 
who didn't win had bad luck?

174
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.540
What the heck are you on about?

175
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.510
Luck doesn't exist just anywhere.

176
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.700
It only comes to those 
who put themselves in its path.

177
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.230
It's the same on the field.

178
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:50.690
Think of soccer as a series of
 inevitabilities and coincidences.

179
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.770
Think back.

180
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.280
Turning zero into one.
 boosting reproducibility.

181
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.030
and making a formula 
for your own weapon...

182
00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:01.240
All of these things you've 
learned here at Blue Lock

183
00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.870
have been about increasing 
the inevitability of you scoring.

184
00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.500
But when your inevitability 
collides with that of your opponent.

185
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:14.590
like it or not. a coincidence is created.
 and it becomes the ground zero of luck.

186
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.880
This last scene right here was just that.

187
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.600
This is the moment Number 16
 dribbled through to shoot.

188
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.680
These five decelerated or
 stopped running altogether.

189
00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.980
Aside from Number 15. 
who anticipated him breaking free.

190
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.140
in that moment. they all made 
a snap judgment to watch the shot.

191
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.150
But one person didn't.

192
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:37.610
Number 1 didn't slow down but
actually accelerated toward Number 15.

193
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.370
He realized a pass wasn't forthcoming.

194
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.530
and realized that Number 15
would try to block a shot.

195
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:47.640
He kept running because he was betting on
 the chance that the shot would be blocked.

196
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.420
H-Hold on a minute.

197
00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:53.690
That might be true. but the ball falling 
where it did was a total coincidence. right?

198
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.210
It could've easily gone anywhere!

199
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.550
That's right.

200
00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:01.300
But you're talking about the 
possibility of the ball becoming yours.

201
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.260
Huh?

202
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:07.260
Suppose Number 1 had 
decelerated like everyone else.

203
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.480
The ball might still have fallen to him.

204
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.270
but if he'd gotten possession 
of the ball in that area.

205
00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:17.400
the other team's defense would've 
swamped him before he could shoot.

206
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:22.030
In other words. that spot 
wasn't a good one for a striker.

207
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:27.050
That's why Number 1 ran into an area where
 he could take aim at the goal in one action.

208
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:31.210
He took up a spot where he could draw the 
winning number. then waited for his luck.

209
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.390
I see.

210
00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:38.770
So by standing on the shit bull's-eye. 
Rin revived the possibility of him scoring.

211
00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:40.090
Ew. sounds gross.

212
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.800
Naturally. there was a possibility 
the ball could've gone to an opponent.

213
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:46.450
If that had happened.

214
00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:49.950
he would've been countered 
and the other team would've won.

215
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.860
That's how close and intense the game was.

216
00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:01.210
There's no doubting that luck was 
the determining factor in that game.

217
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.700
But even if you were 
to have luck on your side.

218
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.450
Luck

219
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.450
if you stood by and did nothing. 
the opportunity would go to waste.

220
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.950
Because of course it would.

221
00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.780
You'd lack the mindset
to respond to coincidences.

222
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.170
That lucky moment would pass you by 
before you could think how to react.

223
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:21.970
Improve so that you're ready to grab 
that chance when it comes around.

224
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.360
Figure out where the chance 
might fall. then wait for it there.

225
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:31.980
The Goddess of Fortune only smiles
 on those who can sniff it out.

226
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.340
Soccer is full of luck and coincidences.

227
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:40.190
So are you going to carry on 
crying about it being a lucky break?

228
00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.400
You're second-rate if you let 
yourself be at the mercy of luck.

229
00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.950
If you've done all you can. 
hold your head up high.

230
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.870
Learn to accept the outcome of 
coincidences and etch them into your mind.

231
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:57.380
Luck only comes equally to those
 who give their all in the fight.

232
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.760
So that's how luck works?

233
00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.790
Rin. you knew all of this?

234
00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:09.640
It's not as if everything this
 four-eyed jerk said is true.

235
00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:14.940
I also had the option of 
passing up the chance to score.

236
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:15.620
Huh?

237
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.400
It wasn't an opening 
I'd controlled or created.

238
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:26.240
The coincidence that you created 
just happened to fall to me.

239
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:35.160
It was only through luck that I beat you. 
That goal was me accepting that.

240
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.620
It was my punishment. 
to remind me that I lost to you.

241
00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:45.740
The difference between Rin and me is our 
resolve to accept fate in victory and defeat.

242
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.300
I-I'm so damn pathetic.

243
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.370
I thought I'd reached Rin's level.

244
00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.640
No. I even thought I'd beaten him.

245
00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.140
But I was the one who lost to Rin.

246
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.790
I lost and got chosen.

247
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.690
I need to accept that fact!

248
00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.150
There won't be a next time otherwise.

249
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.410
I have to add this piece labeled 
"luck" to my thought process

250
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:13.510
and update the knowledge in my brain!

251
00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:15.250
In order to beat Rin.

252
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.450
I need to become a whole new me!

253
00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:23.920
Well then. you've passed
 the second selection.

254
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:28.510
I'm sure you've learned the principle 
behind creating a chemical reaction by now.

255
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.630
So next up is the third selection.

256
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:35.770
As promised. we will hold a training 
camp with the world's top players.

257
00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:42.360
For starters. you'll play a five-a-side game
 against the World Five in 24 hours.

258
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.110
Frogs in the cage. now's the time for 
you to learn about the outside world.

259
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.950
That's...

260
00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:02.420
The Scion of Royale

261
00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:02.420
Spain 
International

262
00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:02.420
Leonardo Luna

263
00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:02.420
That's Luna. the Scion of Royale. 
the illustrious Spanish club.

264
00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:07.300
England 
International

265
00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:07.300
The Goal Junkie

266
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.300
Adam Blake

267
00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:07.300
The English league's 
top scorer. Adam Blake!

268
00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:12.430
Argentina 
International

269
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:12.430
Baby Freckles

270
00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:12.430
Pablo Cabassos

271
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:12.450
World-class free kick taker. 
the freckly Pablo Cabassos!

272
00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:17.680
Brazil
International

273
00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:17.680
The Heavy Tank

274
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.680
Dada Silva

275
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:17.680
And the hungry. heavy tank 
from the favelas. Dada Silva?!

276
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.900
Aw. jeez. this is crazy! 
These really are the world's best strikers!

277
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.140
Tokimitsu. are you some 
kind of soccer facts nerd?

278
00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.820
Yup. Ask me anything.

279
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.240
Wow. what a lineup.

280
00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:34.200
We're gonna play an 
actual game with these guys?

281
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.290
I'm excited and scared in equal measure.

282
00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:42.070
Hm? I don't think I know the guy 
 in the middle with the shaved head.

283
00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:43.420
Oh. you're right.

284
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:52.380
France
International

285
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:52.380
The Child Prodigy
Julian Loki

286
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:46.980
His name is Julian Loki.

287
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.670
He's the French league's newest superstar.

288
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.380
Oh. and he's 17. by the way.

289
00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:56.170
He's the same age as me and 
he already plays for his national team?!

290
00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:57.760
Defeating him...

291
00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:02.140
would finally get my name
 out into the world.

292
00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:59.790
GLAM

293
00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:59.790
GLAM

294
00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.170
Hey. by the way. where's Rin?

295
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:10.370
Oh. Rin-chan always goes off 
on his own at the end of the day.

296
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.410
Training Studio

297
00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.100
What are you doing?

298
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.410
Trying to catch up to you.

299
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.250
Though this is pretty painful.

300
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.170
Idiot.

301
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.400
What are you doing this for?

302
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.510
It's my aftercare. 
A yoga cooldown and meditation.

303
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:40.100
Wow. You do it every day?

304
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.480
And what if I do?

305
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.230
If you're gonna be a pest. get out.

306
00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:51.280
Crushing Itoshi Sae is 
everything to me in soccer.

307
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.430
I've been wondering 
about this for a while now.

308
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:57.200
but are you and your 
big brother on bad terms?

309
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:58.280
Huh?

310
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.660
Oh. uh. it's just that...

311
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:11.800
Not really. It's an awkward yet healthy 
relationship that will fix itself if I beat him.

312
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.190
S-Sounds very stoic.

313
00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.930
I do feel like sticking with you
 will make me stronger.

314
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.140
Rin. you are my rival.

315
00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.690
To me. you're not anything. 
let alone a "rival."

316
00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:27.710
Wha...

317
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.790
Hey. this guy's a year 
younger than me. right?

318
00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.280
He's so damn rude!

319
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:37.470
It's true that in that game and 
in that moment. I lost to you.

320
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.820
But it will never happen again.

321
00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:46.210
Uh. how's this supposed to be a cooldown?
 This one isn't even a yoga pose. is it?

322
00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.540
That's a pose called: 
 "You’re Never Going to Beat Me."

323
00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.120
Bastard...

324
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.510
I know I'm not there yet. 
but someday. I'll beat him!

325
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.220
Don't underestimate me. y'hear?!

326
00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:05.030
Yup. that was my bad. I got carried away.

327
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.190
The highest level I've 
played is prefecturals.

328
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:16.540
Who woulda guessed I'd get to 
play the world's best players?

329
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:26.330
This is no time to be satisfied. 
I must improve. even if only by a bit.

330
00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.580
Isagi!

331
00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.420
Training alone? Want me to join you?

332
00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.390
Bachira? But we're playing the 
World Five first thing tomorrow.

333
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:37.450
Well. so are you.

334
00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.260
Yeah. that's true. but...

335
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:45.100
The monster inside me is gone.

336
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.640
Oh. yeah. you mentioned something about
hearing his voice when you played soccer.

337
00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:55.190
Yeah. But right now. I'm listening 
to my own voice to play soccer.

338
00:18:55.190 --> 00:19:01.570
That was the whole point of me coming
 to Blue Lock and meeting you. Isagi.

339
00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:06.240
He's still a bit strange and 
he doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

340
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.460
but this guy definitely gives me courage.

341
00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.750
Let's devour the World Five!

342
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:19.150
Sounds good. Let's be egoistic!

343
00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:54.290
3rd Selection

344
00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.290
Battlefield

345
00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:57.440
Hah!

346
00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.670
Damn. they're scrawnier than I thought!

347
00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:00.510
See?

348
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:03.030
The Japanese aren't known to be muscular at all.

349
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:06.140
Now. pay up that ten grand you owe me. You lost the bet.

350
00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.080
They're laughing for some reason.

351
00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.920
Is that English? I don't understand it.

352
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.020
Me neither.

353
00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:15.590
They're laughing at me and you guys.

354
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.090
Huh? Aryu-kun. you speak English?

355
00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:21.950
No. I just understand some words. 
because I like western music.

356
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.430
You're just gonna spend it all on women. right?

357
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.180
Huh? Oh. shut up.

358
00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.680
You came here to work. too.

359
00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.680
I wanna go to Harajuku.

360
00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.660
Hey.

361
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.890
What do you mean?

362
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:34.120
Is this game like a part-time job for you?

363
00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.760
Huh? Rin?

364
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.040
You speak English? Respect.

365
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.400
Yeah. that's right!

366
00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:43.250
The Heavy Tank
Dada 
Silva
Brazil 
International

367
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.780
There's no reason I'd come to a place like this between tours

368
00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.260
besides earning a little extra dough.

369
00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.610
Listen up. I'm gonna crush you.

370
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:50.600
Your little Japanese sightseeing trip is gonna turn traumatic.

371
00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.060
I like your spirit. you damn brat.

372
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.620
Okay. that's enough.

373
00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.630
You three are acting like children.

374
00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:59.500
You're Rin Itoshi. right?

375
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.000
I heard about you from Ego.

376
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.730
Huh?

377
00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:04.840
You're that guy. Sae Itoshi's little brother. right?

378
00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:08.320
The Scion of Royale
Leonardo 
Luna
Spain 
International

379
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.320
He made a name for himself

380
00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.320
at one of Royale's subordinate teams.

381
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.740
If you're his brother.

382
00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.750
I'm sure you've got some amazing talent.

383
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:20.880
Blue Lock's third selection:
the World Five five-a-side game.

384
00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:24.340
First to five wins. 
same as the second selection.

385
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:25.690
We'll win.

386
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:31.060
I'm gonna carve my name 
into the minds of these people!

387
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.440
Let's do this...

388
00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.230
Baby Freckles
Pablo Cabassos

389
00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.230
freckly superstar!

390
00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.230
Argentina International

391
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:40.900
Witness the debut of the
transformed Bachira Meguru!

392
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:42.980
Oh. good spin.

393
00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.190
Oh. no. no.

394
00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.410
I'm taking one more touch.

395
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.660
Wow. amazing! You went past Cabassos!

396
00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.990
Nice. Bachira! Let's hit 'em with a one-two!

397
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:54.590
Oh. gimme a break.

398
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:58.750
I ain't gonna pass to someone who 
won't go beyond my imagination.

399
00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.540
He'll only make choices
that allow him to evolve.

400
00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:06.600
This is his new soccer: 
a super-egoistic dribbling style!

401
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.430
In that case. I'll adjust to you!

402
00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.890
Set up a link-up play that's just 
beyond what Bachira can imagine.

403
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:15.140
but that's still within my shooting range.

404
00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.350
Right here! Pass it. Bachira!

405
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.150
Where the heck did he come from?

406
00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.230
The Child Prodigy
Julian Loki

407
00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.860
In that case. I'll just 
have to get behind him!

408
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:24.230
France International

409
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.150
There it is! A whipped cross!

410
00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:29.770
Huh?

411
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.470
Seriously. Bachira and Rin?

412
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:37.750
They used my movement as inspiration...

413
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.710
and hit them with a super-fast linkup play!

414
00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:46.800
W-Wow! Against the World Five?

415
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.300
A move never seen before. 
plus an instant chemical reaction.

416
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:56.220
Right now. they're fangs capable of
 taking a bite out of world-class players.

417
00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:57.890
Whoa. not bad.

418
00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:00.100
No pushovers here.

419
00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.220
Bastards. This is getting interesting.

420
00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:09.840
I'm scoring the next one.

421
00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.210
A

422
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.480
Blue Lock. Additional Time!

423
00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:12.370
Additional Time!

424
00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:12.580
Additional Time!

425
00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:12.790
Additional Time!

426
00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:13.000
Additional Time!

427
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.830
Additional Time!

428
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:14.040
Additional Time!

429
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:13.920
Blue Lock

430
00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:13.960
Blue Lock

431
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.000
Blue Lock

432
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.040
Blue Lock

433
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:14.250
Blue Lock

434
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:14.250
Additional Time!

435
00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:15.000
Blue Lock

436
00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:15.000
Additional Time!

437
00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:17.540
Hey. who left their gear lying around?!

438
00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:19.910
Barou Shouei

439
00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:19.910
Barou Shouei

440
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.980
The Bad Kind of Chemical Reaction

441
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.980
The Bad Kind of Chemical Reaction

442
00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:19.920
I told you to clean up after yourselves!

443
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.290
Hey. why didn't you wake me?

444
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:28.920
Nagi Seishiro

445
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:28.920
Nagi Seishiro

446
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:28.920
It's such a hassle going 
to breakfast alone.

447
00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.300
Hey. Anyone seen my tape?

448
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:36.510
Chigiri Hyoma

449
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:36.510
Chigiri Hyoma

450
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.510
I have no idea where it's gone.

451
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:39.680
Oh. wait.

452
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.890
Isagi 
Yoichi

453
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.890
Isagi 
Yoichi

454
00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.640
Your care kit's in here. Chigiri.

455
00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.100
He always...

456
00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.980
Nagi. let's go get breakfast.

457
00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.230
He used to...

458
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:48.370
Is this all of today's laundry. guys?

459
00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.170
Isagi...

460
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.520
How dare you leave our team in 
the lurch like this. Isagi. you bastard!

461
00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.330
You'll pay for this!

462
00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.220
I'm starving.
