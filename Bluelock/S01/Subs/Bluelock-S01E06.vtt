00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.620
Our next opponent is Team W.

Goal 
Difference

6
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.410
They have one loss against Team V.

7
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.130
So just like us. if they 
lose again. they're done.

8
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.380
But they got the better of 
Barou's Team X. who beat us 4-1.

9
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.820
We should consider them stronger than us.

10
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.840
Well. we are Team Z after all.

11
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.100
I wonder what their playstyle is like.

12
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.420
Well. anyway. one thing we do know is 
that Team W's key players are these two...

Episode 6

25
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.000
I'm Sorry

26
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.690
Their forte is their combination play.

27
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.180
When they beat Barou's Team X.
 these two scored four goals.

28
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.730
Their distance perception. 
their timing for initiating moves.

29
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.510
and their give-and-gos are formidable 
weapons even if you know they're coming.

30
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.770
But it requires both of them
 to use those weapons.

31
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.370
That's right. So we split them up.

32
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.030
That's the key to defeating Team W.

33
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.040
But why is Iemon in charge of this meeting?

34
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.990
It's usually Kuon's job. right?

35
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.780
Yeah. but Kuon isn't back from his bath yet.

36
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.200
Can't I do it?

37
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.220
Yeah. sure! Our plan for
beating them is becoming clear.

38
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.670
Right. Gagamaru?

39
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.530
H-Hey. that hurt!

40
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.950
Man. he's taking his time in that bath.

41
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.420
Stay away from me.

42
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.630
Maybe he passed out.

43
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.840
Not happenin'!

44
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.650
Welcome back. coach.

45
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.260
Sorry I kept you waiting...

46
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.230
Oh. he's alive.

47
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.370
I was thinking about what to call tomorrow's 
operation. and lost track of time.

48
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.150
How's it all going?

49
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.780
We were doing some
analysis on the monitor.

50
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.740
I see.

51
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.320
So you did nearly pass out!

52
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.850
Don't go dying in there. 
or we'll be down to ten players. idiot.

53
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.970
Then we'd never win!

54
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.420
In the next match. we'll put into practice 
what we learned in the last game.

55
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.960
"Operation: 'Next Up. It's Me' Nine" only 
utilized a player's weapon for ten minutes.

56
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.880
so our coordination was low and we wasted
 time when that weapon wasn't viable.

57
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.380
So this time...

58
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.090
We'll go with a front three
of compatible weapons.

59
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.100
and rotate the formation 
three times at 30-minute intervals.

60
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.410
This new operation lets us all shine like 
stars in a three-shift. front three pattern.

61
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.730
We'll call it...

62
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.110
"Operation: Southern All Stars!"

63
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.990
That's so lame. You took that 
long to come up with that?

64
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.020
Your taste in names is the worst!

65
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.100
I think it's great. I like that band. 
"Erotica Seven" is a good song.

66
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.580
Gagamaru! You get it!

67
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.370
By the way. will I be staying in goal?

68
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.960
What do ya want us to do? We're winning.

69
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.050
Why are you even bringing that up now?

70
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.050
I'm grateful to you.

71
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.970
Kind of.

72
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.310
Isagi... Thanks.

73
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.510
Chigiri. how about you? 
Are you okay with staying in defense?

74
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.270
If you have time to worry about others.

75
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.480
use it to think about 
how you're going to score.

76
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.310
Oh. sorry...

77
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.360
Okay!

78
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.740
We've researched our opponent. 
and we're becoming more like a team.

79
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.950
We're gonna win. Team Z!

80
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.200
Yeah!

81
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.250
That's right. If we lose. we're done.

82
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.230
We will win this!

83
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.380
Building 5

84
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.340
Match 7

85
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.900
You ready. bro?

86
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.150
When do you want the pass?

87
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.450
What kind of pass do you want? Hey. tell me!

88
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.520
Hm? I see!

89
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.510
Aye-aye. sir!

90
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.310
"I want you to pass it to my feet
 at this particular moment."

91
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.910
That's what my bro says!

92
00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:58.700
Amen!

93
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.500
"And from there. a one-two!"

94
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.710
That's what my bro says.

95
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.010
What's with these guys?! Someone stop them!

96
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.470
For the first 30 minutes. I'm in defense
 as the right-sided center-back.

97
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.240
My task is clear.

98
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.450
First. all of us need to try and stop
 those two and their combination playâ€”

99
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:18.860
What?!

100
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.520
We're not stopping them at all!

101
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.400
We watched the footage 
and made plans. but...

102
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.240
"Our weapon is our eye contact."

103
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.710
"It's not something a makeshift 
defense can see through!"

104
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.780
That's what my bro thinks deep down.

105
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.130
Here they come. Chigiri!

106
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.080
We'll stop them!

107
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.410
"Chigiri"?

108
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.540
You mean. that Chigiri?
 The genius made of glass?

109
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.650
Hey. bro! Can you believe 
he's still playing soccer?

110
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.500
He must be clinging to past glories!

111
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.720
Uh-huh. so true!

112
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.550
"If I may say this. as his former teammate..."

113
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.810
"Your time as a player is over."

114
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.520
That's what my bro says.

115
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.240
Are you sure that's wise?

116
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.090
If you run. your glass leg will shatter again!

117
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.690
"What the hell. man?!"

118
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.540
"That's a foul. Mr. VAR!"

119
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.120
That's what my bro's yelling!

120
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.260
Yeah. I know it was borderline. 
you crazy chattering twins!

121
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.340
But they didn't call it. so it's not a foul!

122
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.590
Nice pass. Isagi!

123
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.090
Don't pay any attention 
to what they say. Chigiri.

124
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.010
The past doesn't matter.

125
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:38.180
To me. you are Chigiri Hyoma of Team Z!

126
00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.150
Shut up. do-gooder.

127
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.900
I told you to leave me alone.

128
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.780
I'm not saying it for you.

129
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.140
Unlike you. I don't have any past 
achievements I can be proud of.

130
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.620
But I came here because 
I didn't want to give up soccer.

131
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.860
I'm here at Blue Lock to change my life.

132
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.000
I might know nothing about 
your past or your injury...

133
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.310
But I do know that we are strikers!

134
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.240
Regret. pain. all that stuff...

135
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.010
One shot at goal. and all of it is behind us.

136
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.670
Yeah!

137
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.410
Who cares about your past?

138
00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.570
What I want to see is your present.

139
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:36.490
We didn't come to Blue Lock 
to cry and give up. right?

140
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.870
"What the hell?! Defenders. 
it's your job to stop them. idiots!"

141
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:42.720
That's what my bro says.

142
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.460
Sorry!

143
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.270
Okay.

144
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:45.540
Let's go get 'em!

145
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.130
You ready. bro?

146
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.880
With the two of us combining. 
it'll be another easy win.

147
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.220
Wait. bro?

148
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.250
Stop that! Your face is revealing too much.

149
00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.610
Hey. bro! They're coming in from the side!

150
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.060
He's not focused at all.

151
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:03.930
I'll take that.

152
00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.310
Didn't I tell you?! Bro. you moron!

153
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:08.860
Our target man is...

154
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.070
Kuon-chan. huh?

155
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.210
Since jumping is your weapon. 
I'm sure you can reach that.

156
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.690
Really? You're taking a shot from there?

157
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:34.980
Take that!

158
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.570
Kuon. you scored again?!
 The goalie couldn't even react!

159
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.510
No fair. You keep getting chances.

160
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.350
I think I'm on fire today!

161
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.180
Kuon...

162
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.310
"Don't get cocky 'cause of a fluky shot!"

163
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.050
No. bro!

164
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.600
You gotta focus!

165
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.800
Stay frosty!

166
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:58.700
All right! Now it's our turn to play up front.

167
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.970
Kuon can't have all the fun!

168
00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:02.370
We're gonna go all-out.

169
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.320
Foul by Wanima Junichi.

170
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.030
Free kick to Team Z.

171
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.170
A chance for us to score.

172
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.130
Free kick taker:

173
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.130
Bachira

174
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.090
They're in bad shape.

175
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.890
Their marking's weakest...

176
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:25.430
Ah. there!

177
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.400
Kuon?!

178
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.440
It's that guy...

179
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.400
Yeah! A hat-trick!

180
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:42.160
45 mins in

181
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:42.160
Half-time

182
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.160
1st half

183
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:48.980
I didn't notice him until today. 
but he's pretty amazing. isn't he?

184
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.000
Sweet! We're 3-0 up at half-time!

185
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.420
Kuon's weapon exploded! 
You're really standing out today!

186
00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.340
Man. oh man. oh man!

187
00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.340
Things are going so well 
for me today. it's scary.

188
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.350
In Honda Keisuke's words.
 the ketchup's flowing!

189
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.950
I'll score a hat-trick and make it 6-0!

190
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:12.050
Coach Kuon's "Operation: 
Southern All Stars" is working well.

191
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.780
The name sounds kind of cool now!

192
00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.820
I thought it was cool
 from the beginning.

193
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.300
Let's stay focused!

194
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.660
Yeah!

195
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.500
Thanks to Kuon's play. 
the team's attacking aggressively.

196
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.420
We're getting stronger.

197
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.530
Let's go!

198
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:35.840
Yeah!

199
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.470
When you're in a place as intense as this.

200
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:46.190
can you still say you're planning 
to give up on soccer. Chigiri?

201
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.570
2nd half begins

202
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.290
We're kickin' off Raichi 
time from here on out!

203
00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:08.050
Oh? "Big bro" himself has been 
forced to come and stop me?

204
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.410
Raichi! Pass it back for now!

205
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.620
Let's take our time!

206
00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.350
Pass it back to me. Kuon.

207
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.670
Stop skimming the cream!

208
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:23.580
Of course. Our top priority 
is winning as a team...

209
00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.930
I'm stealing the cream.

210
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:29.680
Hey! You gave the ball away!

211
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.470
Those two have dropped back
 into midfield now?

212
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.560
Then I'll stop them. even if 
it means borderline fouling them!

213
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:37.770
Chigiri!

214
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:45.660
I'll stop them!

215
00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:46.840
Here.

216
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.620
Damn it.

217
00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.400
Those two are too 
dangerous to leave free.

218
00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.040
We still have a two-goal lead.

219
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.210
Let's not panic. We'll pass it 
around and build up steadily.

220
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:06.930
Yeah. he's right. We're still in the lead.

221
00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:08.850
Isagi-kun.

222
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.680
Huh? He's passing it back to me?

223
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:13.380
And it's under-hit!

224
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.230
Ah. sorry!

225
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:22.110
This careless mistake is going to be fatal!

226
00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:28.030
Yay!

227
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:30.370
What the hell are ya doing. Kuon?!

228
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:34.290
Did you lose your focus after
 scoring your hat-trick?! Huh?!

229
00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.290
Calm down. Raichi! No fighting!

230
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:36.510
I'm sorry. I...

231
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:41.840
What am I doing in an 
important game like this?

232
00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:44.210
Sorry!

233
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.540
Get up. Kuon. You didn't do it on purpose.

234
00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.600
Let's press on.

235
00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.530
What?

236
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:55.490
An apology isn't enough!
 He's cost us two goals!

237
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:58.470
We're still in the lead. 
so let's just come up with a plan.

238
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:02.800
Right. Do we want to keep attacking. 
or play more defensively?

239
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.280
Come on. Stand up.

240
00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:06.750
I'm sorry...

241
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.200
This is bad. We have got to stop
 the next shot from going in.

242
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.070
Or else...

243
00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.500
Huh?

244
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:22.270
Did he just... smile?

245
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.050
Maybe I imagined it.

246
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.470
15 mins in

247
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.470
15 mins in

248
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.470
2nd half

249
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.470
2nd half

250
00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.470
A slender one-goal lead
 with 30 minutes left...

251
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.600
We need to go score one more goal!

252
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.300
Yeah. let's go get 'em.

253
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.060
That's the spirit! Right. Isagi?

254
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:39.770
Yeah!

255
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:47.900
Well. anyway. if we get the next goal. 
we can dominate this game.

256
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.570
Bring it on!

257
00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.910
Don't get overwhelmed by their pace!

258
00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.000
This is the combination we practiced.

259
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.170
with Isagi as the pivot. and Bachira and I 
forming a triangle to slice through them.

260
00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.880
If a chance presents itself. 
I'm ready to hit a mid-range shot.

261
00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.070
But the goal's still too far away. 
and there's no path through to it.

262
00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:11.200
If Bachira can use his dribbling
to break up their formation...

263
00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.760
Hey. come on now...

264
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.490
My path to Bachira is blocked?

265
00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:16.390
In that case...

266
00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:17.340
Isagi!

267
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.620
Do they know how we're looking to linkup?

268
00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.360
Man. you're so annoying!

269
00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:25.780
Shit.

270
00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:26.570
Strange...

271
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.430
However much they studied us.

272
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:32.460
there's no way they could see 
through our combination at first sight.

273
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.170
Our weapons are being killed.

274
00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.750
I can't smell a goal!

275
00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:41.790
Nice work. bro!

276
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:42.460
Damn it!

277
00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.630
Something's wrong here. 
They must know our plans somehow.

278
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.430
No. there's no way that can be true!

279
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.640
If we lose. we're done!

280
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.890
Where's the benefit in doing that?

281
00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:58.430
A hat-trick!

282
00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.230
He's cost us two goals!

283
00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:06.230
Come to think of it. all the goals 
in this game have been scored by...

284
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.190
Finish it. bro!

285
00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.080
You can do it. Kuon!

286
00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:10.610
Clear it!

287
00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:14.570
He missed it on purpose?

288
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.330
Yeah!

289
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:28.730
Kuon.

290
00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:35.140
Are you... betraying us?

291
00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.130
Bingo!

292
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:50.330
They figured it out. so might 
as well come clean. Kuon-chan.

293
00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:57.450
Your tactics. weapons. and weaknesses...
Literally everything was leaked to us.

294
00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:04.870
You sneaked out during your team meeting
 last night to propose this plan. didn't you?

295
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:08.830
Back then?

296
00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.260
And so...

297
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:14.840
"This game is ours!"

298
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.970
That's what we're saying.

299
00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.580
This is a joke. right? Kuon...

300
00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:26.350
Oh. yikes. So it's true.

301
00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:29.290
This is bullshit!

302
00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:30.410
I'll kill you!

303
00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:33.030
What the hell were you thinking. huh?!

304
00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:37.950
I'm just doing my best to survive in Blue Lock.

305
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.970
Yellow card to Raichi Jingo.

306
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:47.040
Return to your half immediately
and resume the game.

307
00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:53.000
How can I?! I can't play 
under these conditions!

308
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:53.960
Hey...

309
00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:56.260
What's going on?

310
00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.870
This is more like the song 
"Selfishly Sinbad."

311
00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:00.860
If we lose. we're done!

312
00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.100
What's the point of trying 
to lose on purpose?

313
00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.940
You're the dumb ones.

314
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.360
Only you guys will be going home if we lose.

315
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:16.150
I will survive here alone.

316
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:21.990
Thanks. Kuon-chan.

317
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.200
He passed it to the other team?!

318
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:30.050
From here on out. we're playing 12-on-10.

319
00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.710
Are you going to allow this. Ego-san?!

320
00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.870
Just shut up and watch.

321
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.890
What? Ego-san!

322
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:44.300
Now. what will you do. Team Z?

323
00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.060
Kuon... But why?

324
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:54.650
When your last-minute goal won the 
last game for us. it got me thinking.

325
00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:59.810
If we're always going to be 
walking a tightrope like that.

326
00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:03.200
the chances of this team 
surviving this tournament are slim.

327
00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:06.830
According to the chart. 
our final opponent is Team V.

328
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:11.500
the only team with two wins in our group.

329
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.500
Points

330
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.500
Points

331
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.500
Points

332
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.500
Goal Difference

333
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.500
Goal Difference

334
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.500
Goal Difference

335
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:16.330
They beat Team Y 8-0. 
but we struggled badly against them.

336
00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.090
There's no way we can beat them.

337
00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:23.990
So I decided to give up on winning as 
a team and focus on moving up alone.

338
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.310
Alone?

339
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.720
Oh. come on now. Have you forgotten?

340
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:33.620
When this first selection started.
 Ego mentioned a special rule.

341
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:37.230
Even if your team isn't 
one of the top two teams.

342
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:42.450
if you are your team's top scorer. 
you get to proceed to the next selection.

343
00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.720
So I made a deal.

344
00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:53.000
I promised to give Team W info on us and 
let them have the three points for the win.

345
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.380
if they let me score three goals.

346
00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:01.500
That way. I'm the top scorer 
on this team and I can advance.

347
00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.260
You...

348
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.400
So fighting together up 
to now has meant nothing?!

349
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.520
You said we'd win together!

350
00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.620
Thank you. Isagi-kun.

351
00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:18.440
I'm glad you're so gullible.

352
00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:25.290
Stop being naÃ¯ve. This is Blue Lock.

353
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.700
We don't need "bonds" or "teamwork."

354
00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.950
What you need is enough ego to win.

355
00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.830
Yup. "If you need to betray
 people to win. do it."

356
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.920
That's what my ego says.

357
00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.450
Great work. Team Z.

358
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:54.980
Damn it. Damn it! Damn it!

359
00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.490
I won't let it end this way!

360
00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:30.330

home is where the rice is!

No way. man. With bread. you get more variety.

407
00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:55.780
You have rice for lunch and dinner. 
so it's obviously bread for breakfast. idiots!

408
00:22:55.780 --> 00:23:00.360
Rice is best for breakfast. Eat bread 
and you're hungry again soon after.
