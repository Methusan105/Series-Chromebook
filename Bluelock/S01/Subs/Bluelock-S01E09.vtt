00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.650
Nice goal. Nagi! Just like I envisioned it!

2
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.580
Reo. can I play hooky now?

3
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.690
Not yet. Five more goals. then you can.

4
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.620
Aw. How about four?

5
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.550
What was that goal just now?

6
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.750
A super long pass from over his shoulder?

7
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.380
Not to mention. the topspin on it
 and how it dropped like a stone.

8
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.310
Controlling that ball on the run 
is difficult enough in itself.

9
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.180
But he also had a defender
 on either side of him.

10
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.870
If his control wasn't pinpoint. 
they could've stolen it off him at any time.

11
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.730
But he plucked it out of the air 
without breaking stride.

12
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.180
So many high-level techniques 
were packed into that one moment.

13
00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.420
That's the top-ranked player in Building 5...

14
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.060
Nagi Seishiro.

15
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.280
Five more goals?

16
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.990
What a hassle.

17
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.830
This is the monster we're up against?

18
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.020
Episode 9

Awakening

20
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.820
What the heck was that?

21
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.020
Pure luck.

22
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.980
It's only one goal.

23
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.810
It's time for us to attack! Amen!

24
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.320
We gotta do this.

25
00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.780
That's right. We have to
stick to what we know.

26
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.410
Kunigami!

27
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.910
Right.

28
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.450
If I can get the ball there...

29
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.870
Ten more meters.

30
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.830
Six... Three...

31
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.540
You're still not in shooting range. are you...

32
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.700
Kunigami Gains-kun?

Hold it! I won't let you!

36
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.880
He's good at holding onto it.

37
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.880
Ready for another. Nagi?

38
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.760
The same play as before?

39
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.520
Stop him. Raichi and Igaguri!

40
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.560
I'll go press him!

41
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.810
That trick won't work a second time!

42
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.020
It popped up! This is our chance!

43
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.720
Seriously?

44
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.700
Wh-What the hell was that?

45
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.600
That was no joke.

This is bad. It's already 2-0!

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.980
Our plan won't work now!

50
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.990
Is there a way out of this?

51
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.660
Hey. Kunigami!

52
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.300
Why'd ya let him take the ball?

53
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.680
Ya should've scored! If the front line
 ain't doin' its job. we can't win!

54
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.430
Shut up.

55
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.100
Do your job and defend.

56
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.970
Enough!

57
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.260
If we lose this game. we're done. 
We just need to play our best so we can win!

58
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.250
H-He's right! We can't give up!

59
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.520
Amen! Never give up!

60
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.790
Amen up!

61
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.870
We still have one weapon left.

62
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.080
Go. Chigiri!

63
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.290
Right!

64
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.740
The flank! Get the ball!

65
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.960
I will turn the tables
with these legs of mine!

66
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.170
This guy...

67
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.090
He's fast!

68
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.800
Someone was faster than Chigiri?

69
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.220
Nice. Zantetsu!

70
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.520
I'll go to him! He's gonna pass to Nagi!

71
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.760
Damn it! I'll drop back. too!

72
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.350
In that case...

73
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.100
Go on. Zantetsu.

74
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.850
This is your territory. right?

75
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.390
Oh. crap. We put too many people 
on Nagi and left that guy free.

76
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.600
Move back up. Naruhaya!

77
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.710
Yeah. this is my territory.

78
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.870
Reo...

79
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.350
What exactly does "territory" mean?

Wearing fake glasses won't
 make you smart. y'know.

83
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.080
Stupid Zantetsu.

84
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.490
We can still do this.

85
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.340
Amen up...

86
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.340
It's a hopeless situation.

87
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:36.940
Right now. none us believe
 fighting to win is an option anymore.

88
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.110
I love it.

89
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.820
This is getting fun.

90
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.020
What's with that guy?

91
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.320
No idea.

92
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.790
Bachira. what are you talking about?

93
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.710
Huh? I mean. isn't that trio just incredible?

94
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.210
I'm all hyped up!

95
00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.500
Huh? We're 3-0 down!
 At this rate. we'll never—

96
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.310
Wait. Isagi. Don't tell me you're scared.

97
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.340
Sure. their goals were super special.

98
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.810
But the solution is obvious. We need...

99
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.190
to be super special. too!

100
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.010
Wha—

101
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.560
Isagi! Hey. pass!

102
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.320
Uh. but they already know our plan—

103
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.340
So we go beyond that.

104
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.340
C'mon. hurry it up or they'll steal it.

105
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.530
If weapons and formulas didn't work
 when we used them to the max.

106
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:39.000
then if we manage to score against them.
it'll be when we've surpassed our limits. right?

107
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.620
The monster inside me is saying:

108
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.780
"We should be excited. not scared.
when we're in a desperate situation."

109
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.430
Bachira...

110
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.140
You're interesting.

111
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.010
Bring it on. Bachira Meguru!

112
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.180
You got it.

113
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.300
I'll run past you!

114
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:57.300
Wow.

115
00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.520
Ultra-fast step overs?

116
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.100
Feinting left. but you're going right. yeah?

117
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.190
A roulette?

118
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.110
Zantetsu!

119
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.920
Oh no you don't. Blunt Bangs.

120
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.140
Speedy Specs.

121
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.990
In that case...

122
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.530
A lob?

123
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.660
If we both go for it. 
I've got the advantage.

124
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.120
Outside. So he's going left.

125
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.790
Wait. right?

126
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.020
Zoom!

127
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.250
An air elástico?!

128
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.590
Hey. it worked! Wow. there's 
no end to my inspiration!

129
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.510
My bad! Crazy guy inbound!

130
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.680
Just three more and I'm at the goal!

131
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.510
All three of you go tackle him!

132
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.310
I love it.

133
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.720
We're here to become the 
best striker in the world.

134
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.850
If I can't beat you. that means 
I'm only at that level as a striker.

135
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.350
Three more.

136
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.700
Bachira. you're amazing.

137
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.160
You look so happy to be playing soccer.

138
00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.550
You're totally right.

139
00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:03.120
If this is going to be the last serious
 game of my whole soccer career...

140
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:04.830
Two...

141
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:06.620
One...

142
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.730
I can leave the despair for when I've lost!

143
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.470
Right now. in order to win. I will...

144
00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:17.370
Boom!

145
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.270
Bastard! Don't screw with...

146
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.820
Aw yeah. Bachira!

147
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:30.480
A rabona?!

148
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.250
So cool!

149
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.610
Did you see my super special goal?

150
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.510
See? It's getting fun now. right?

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.520
They seem to have a sense 
of. uh... complacency?

155
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.340
The word you want is "camaraderie."

156
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.760
Silly Zantetsu.

157
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.410
He's interesting.

158
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.260
We'll have to crush him completely.

159
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.530
Aw. man. Sounds like a hassle.

160
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.110
That was a super special
limit-breaking goal!

161
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:13.320
That was so cool. Bachira!

162
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.700
I feel like I can break my limits now. too!

163
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.810
Surpassing your limits doesn't
 mean just being reckless.

164
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:21.890
Nice play. Bachira.

165
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.640
Wait. it doesn't?

166
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.530
That goal was born out of 
Bachira's weapon: his dribbling.

You're right.

I tried all that stuff 'cause I was inspired.
 and I just happened to succeed.

192
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:50.660
In short. we have to try new things
 in this game and evolve. or we'll lose.

193
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:51.440
Right.

194
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.250
Bachira's play has 
changed our perspective.

195
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.400
We have 65 minutes left.

196
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.290
What we need to do is evolve our ego!

197
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.440
Let's go get one more!

198
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.700
Yeah!

199
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.660
I'll find this evolved formula
 that works only for me!

200
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.880
Just look at them. all hyped up like that.

201
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.070
They looked down and out a minute ago.

202
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.640
Hm? Are you mad. Reo?

203
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.090
Not really.

204
00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:21.680
It's just. since Nagi and I took up soccer
 six months ago. our record's spotless.

205
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.680
and I don't want a stain on it.

206
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.810
Huh? Six months ago?

207
00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:29.100
Oh. wow. They're definitely monsters!

208
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.710
You've got to be kidding.

209
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.610
Raichi. man-mark Reo!

210
00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.940
What? Why the hell should I?!

211
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.200
With your physique. we can pincer him!

212
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.110
Chigiri and Gagamaru. 
cover the space that opens up!

213
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:45.080
We need to stop Reo before he sets up Nagi. 
or they'll do the same thing again!

214
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.360
We'll go with that!

215
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.090
Adjust the formation!

216
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.300
Damn it.

217
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.040
I can't play my sexy 
soccer in this position.

218
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.940
Fine. I'll do it. you bastards!

me being a defender in a game like this!

Leave it to me.

227
00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.450
I'll slice open a path to the goal again.

228
00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:18.570
Oh no you don't!

229
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.760
It's my turn to crush you.

here is me. Stupid Specs!

We're not friends. so don't call me stupid...

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.290
slowpoke!

233
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:30.400
You ready. Nagi?

234
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.000
You think I'd stay quiet after you beat me?

235
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.820
I touched it. slowpoke!

236
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.770
Nice. Chigiri! Good job!

237
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.380
The pass went astray!

238
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.390
Now I can steal the ball!

What?

240
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.760

Stop him! Don't let him get
 within shooting range!

257
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:19.050
At 28 meters out. the success rate of 
my weapon—my mid-range shot—jumps up.

258
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:20.510
Too far out still.

259
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.090
I can't score unless I evolve.

260
00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.090
What do I do? Should I try
 to dribble past them?

261
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.880
No. that's not in my arsenal.

Pass it to me. Kunigami!

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:31.430
What should I do?

264
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:34.730
If this were to be my 
last game. what would I—

265
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.220
Don't be scared. Kunigami! Go for it!

266
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.380
You're gonna be a superhero. aren't you?

267
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.320
Huh? Wait. yeah. that's right.

268
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:48.030
If I want to evolve. I shouldn't settle 
for doing something I can already do!

269
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.490
No one's pressing me.

270
00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:52.140
A shot from outside my 28-meter range.

271
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.670
Zeroing in on the sweet spot
 for a full-power. technical shot!

272
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:59.000
If I were a superhero. that's what I'd do!

273
00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.170
A long shot from outside his range?
 But it's dead center.

274
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:04.880
If I punch it clear...

275
00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.470
There was no spin?!

276
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.670
Take that!

277
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:16.910
One more goal and we're tied!

278
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:19.710
Kunigami's shot was totally awesome!

279
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.900
Why didn't you tell us you had such 
an amazing no-spin mid-range shot?

280
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.200
Superhero Gains-kun!

281
00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.390
No...

282
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:31.260
I just focused on how I made 
contact with the ball more than usual.

283
00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.450
And I feel like I experienced 
a new sensation for scoring.

284
00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.840
Still. that was amazing!

285
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.210
So you broke through for real!

286
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.920
There's a formula for scoring 
that uses your weapon.

287
00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:45.590
And if you extrapolate it. there's a new 
sensation for scoring waiting at the end.

288
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:50.710
Basically. your ego can only evolve as an 
extension of what you are capable of now.

289
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:53.810
Then. what's in my arsenal right now?

290
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.640
My spatial awareness? 
My movement on the field?

291
00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.610
How did I manage to score that goal?

292
00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.510
If this is to be my last game.

293
00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.140
I want to try out a new version of myself!

294
00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.330
Our five-at-the-back formation is working.

295
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.830
Let's give more than a hundred 
percent in the second half. too!

296
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:18.290
Yeah! Whether you like it or not.
 we only have 45 minutes left!

297
00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:21.100
We'll level the match. then score the winner!

298
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.920
Do your job. front line!

299
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.840
We'll be the ones to win this!

300
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.130
Yeah!

301
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.840
We'll be the ones to win this.

302
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.870
They're sitting deep. 
and all they do is counter.

303
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.930
We'll change our own tactics in response.

304
00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:36.910
That redhead...

305
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:41.620
He called me stupid. even though 
he doesn't know me. He's going down.

306
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.750
That's the spirit. stupid Zantetsu.

307
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.900
There's no way we're gonna lose. Okay. Nagi?

308
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:48.210
Sure.

309

Go. Kunigami!

312
00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:58.540
Of course they'd press me quicker now.

313
00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:02.210
It's obviously reckless to 
shoot from here. In that case...

314
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.400
And immediately out to Gagamaru!

Aw. man. I'm too far ahead of it.

Whatever. I'll shoot. anyway.

Wow! A scorpion kick!

Crap. The path of my shot got blocked.

331
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.930
It's no good. This formula 
won't allow me to score a goal.

332
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.200
Isagi. behind you!

333
00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.220
What are you doing? You suck!

334
00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.380
Get back!

335
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.090
I'm sorry!

336
00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:47.490
What am I lacking? What could I have done?

337
00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:48.250
Clear it!

338
00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.720
I managed to get in range for 
a shot. but I couldn't shoot.

339
00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:57.780
If my weapon was dribbling. 
or a strong physique to hold onto the ball...

340
00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:00.870
No. wishing for things 
I don't have is pointless.

341
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:04.060
A clue to how I can evolve 
lies somewhere inside of me.

342
00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.520
I gotta think about what I can and can't do!

343
00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.930
How do I evolve my weapon 
in this limited amount of time?!

344
00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:12.780
You're totally useless.

345
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:17.060
You were so full of yourself. 
so why didn't you shoot?

346
00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.790
You're so inefficient.

347
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.410
Nagi Seishiro!

348
00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:24.350
But I mean. why don't you just give up?

349
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.470
Why are you still coming at us?

350
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.410
Are you stupid? I don't get it.

351
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:34.380
If my talents were at your level. 
I would've quit soccer by now.

352
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.880
So tell me.

353
00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.260
What motivates you so much?

354
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.690
Shut up. genius.

355
00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:44.890
I'm about to get to the good part!

356
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.960
What's with that creature?

357
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.190
Stay up top. Nagi! 
We'll hit them on the counter!

358
00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:55.910
I'm not letting you go anywhere!

359
00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.280
Are you my stalker or what?

360
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.330
I'll demolish you!

361
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:06.520
The match is turning out 
just as you predicted. Ego-san.

362
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.420
Yeah. it's intense.

363
00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.700
Win or lose. Life or death.

364
00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:17.860
Every time that line is crossed. 
a striker is forced to awaken.

365
00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:20.680
This is what I wanted to see.

366
00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.180
Anri-chan. do you know 
what it means to awaken?

367
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:30.850
Huh? Um. is it like going from ordinary to
 extraordinary. like a Super Sai... Well. that?

368
00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.850
Yup. you're way off.

369
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:38.400
That's a silly analogy made by someone 
who's never tasted success.

370
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.190
Sill—

371
00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:44.450
Awakening is like doing a jigsaw puzzle with your
 accumulated thoughts and experiences.

372
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:50.170
You're faced with an extreme situation to
 get the win. and after much trial and error.

373
00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:55.130
that's when the pieces for success all 
fall into place. and a new ego blooms.

374
00:17:55.390 --> 00:18:01.080
In short. the moment you awaken is the 
moment you learn who you really are.

375
00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:03.470
Why didn't you shoot?

376
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.430
You're so inefficient.

377
00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.400
"Inefficient"?

378
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.690
I see. I was being inefficient.

379
00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.400
That moment I took to think 
about whether to shoot...

380
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.030
That lost moment gave them
 time to block my shot.

381
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:22.170
With my weapon—my spatial awareness—
I can get into a good position for a shot.

382
00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.590
But if I don't shoot. nothing will happen!

383
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:28.040
Cut out the waste!

384
00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.170
Reo! Build it up one more time!

385
00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.250
Tsk. This stalker's really annoying.

386
00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:34.980
Hey. what's the matter?

387
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.710
Gonna report me to the police?

388
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.060
He's been running non-stop.

389
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.930
Doesn't he ever get tired?

390
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:44.520
I'll admit that you're good.

391
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.760
But I'm starting to see how to stop you.

392
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.080
When you receive a pass. 
the first thing you do is look for Nagi!

393
00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.150
Tch.

394
00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:56.110
Nice work. Raichi! The pass lanes to Nagi 
are limited now. so it's easier to defend.

395
00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.970
Yup. you don't scare me anymore. genius.

396
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:00.570
Amen!

397
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.860
You can't do anything 
unless Reo tells you to.

398
00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.160
Same goes for you. Reo!

399
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.250
Without that genius. 
you're just a master of none!

400
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.380
You bastard.

401
00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.860
Team V. Number 9. Mikage Reo.

402
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.180
Yellow card for elbowing an opponent.

403
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:25.180
Go on. get frustrated. 
One more card and you're off.

404
00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:26.940
Go. missy!

405
00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.230
Team Z
BL Ranking

406
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.230
th

407
00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:28.850
Do your thing!

408
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:30.860
Just try it. missy.

409
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.060
I'm faster.

410
00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.020
Don't call me "missy."

411
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:38.400
If I don't outrun him. we can't score.

412
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.910
Against his center of gravity!

413
00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:40.650
This way?

414
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.360
He reacts fast. too.

415
00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.490
I see.

416
00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:47.570
His weapon is most likely 
his explosive acceleration.

417
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:51.000
He has the advantage when comparing 
reaction times at this distance.

418
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.340
I have no chance against him. 
no matter how many times I try.

419
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:56.750
But wait.

420
00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:00.650
I did get a touch on the ball earlier.

421
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:01.630
In that case...

422
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:08.010
If one doesn't exist. I should create a 
situation where I can fully utilize my weapon!

423
00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.640
There's no one there. 
Is that a desperate pass?

424
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:12.100
Yup. To myself.

425
00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.860
Huh? You're so naïve. missy. I told you...

426
00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:17.820
I'm faster!

427
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.890
I know that. Stupid Specs.

428
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.300
Only initially. though.

429
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.030
Huh?

430
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:26.870
An awakening can only happen 
in extreme situations.

431
00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:34.470
For example. when faced with a formidable
 foe. the weak crank their skills up to ten...

432
00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.340
to create a new formula to win.

433
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:44.450
Over ten meters. where initial velocity 
is everything. I can't beat him.

434
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:49.990
So what I'll do is draw him out to a range
 where my weapon is at its most effective!

435
00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:52.970
Fifty meters in 5.77 seconds.

436
00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:58.650
At top speed on a long sprint. I'm faster!

437
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.190
Back off. slowpoke.

438
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:07.750
Thirty minutes until the end of the match.

439
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:11.160
The best striker in the world is...

440
00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:18.000
the one that can dominate...

441
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.120
this blue frenzy.

442
00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:54.290
Blue Lock. Additional Time.

443
00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.230

444
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.390
