1
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.620
Well. you and me aren't the type of 
players who'll get picked if we lose.

2
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.580
We're in the same boat. aren't we?

3
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.060
You can't play it safe here.

4
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.500
If you do. you're done.

5
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.730
So let's crush each other. Isagi.

6
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.500
Our dreams are at stake.

7
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.760
Don't chicken out.

8
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.530
This is Blue Lock. you know?

9
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.020
Hey. Isagi.

10
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.730
Do you know why my team wanted to play you?

11
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.200
We thought we could beat you. Isagi.

12
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.330
Huh?

13
00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.460
Isagi. let's stop him!

14
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.290
He passed?!

15
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.810
And back to me. shorty.

16
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.250
No chance.

17
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.920
He got us!

18
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.980
I wanna catch up with you geniuses.

19
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.550
It was saved! He didn't
 hit it with enough power!

20
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.060
Isagi. the second ball! 
We'll get it and counter!

21
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.350
Move!

22
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.890
Don't stand in my way!

23
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.090
Naruhaya and me are the same.

24
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.280
We're one step short!

25
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.630
Naruhaya's weapon gets him in 
behind the defense. but he can't finish.

26
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.290
My direct shot works in front of the goal.
 but I have no way of getting myself there.

27
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.010
We're average Joes with opposite problems.

28
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.710
The one who overcomes
 his own limitation first...

29
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.010
will win this game!

30
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.980
Episode 15

31
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.980
Devour

32
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.530
As annoying as it is. Naruhaya's right.

33
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.790
Isagi. you're not the type 
who's able to fight alone.

34
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.820
You're not a genius like Barou or Nagi.

35
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.960
Me and you...

36
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.570
We're both just average Joes.

37
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.850
I don't have a weapon I can use
 in a one-on-one situation

38
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.930
that'll put me on the 
level of Nagi and Barou.

39
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.250
If I'm not in the genius column.

40
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.750
there's no way I can become 
the best striker in the world.

41
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.510
Find it.

42
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.550
I have to find what I lack during this game.

43
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.190
Let's go. Isagi.

44
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.240
Time to make a comeback.

45
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.050
Yeah.

46
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.160
I don't want to flunk out of 
a place like this as an average Joe!

47
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.370
I'll try every single trick I can think of!

48
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.150
Dribbling isn't the only way to 
dominate a one-on-one situation!

49
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.050
If I can make it a two-on-one.
even for a split second.

50
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.760
then even with my lack of pace. I mightâ€”

51
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.720
Not so fast. Mr. Average Joe!

52
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.890
I'll have to try another way.

53
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.390
What are you doing. Isagi?

54
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.850
Have it back.

55
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.720
All yours. Nagi!

56
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.000
Damn. I ended up relying on Nagi again.

57
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.650
But this isn't gonna help anything.

58
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.820
The game will continue
 with just the two of them.

59
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.570
At this rate. I'm never gonna manage...

60
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.490
to surpass these geniuses.

61
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:18.630
So. wait. is changing my tactics and actions 
not enough to find what I'm looking for?

62
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:20.630
Damn it!

63
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.620
I'm not letting it end here.

64
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.430
That would mean it's not my actions 
I need to change. It's my thoughts.

65
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.270
Don't get caught up in how I used to be.

66
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.570
Change can only begin when you 
tear down everything you were before.

67
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.900
That should do it.

68
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.240
Well. it didn't.

69
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:50.910
Nice. Nagi!

70
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.370
The second ball!

71
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.330
I got it! Now I can counter!

72
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.040
Isagi. behind you!

73
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.960
Huh?

74
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.380
I'm not losing to you one-on-one.

75
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.340
Naruhaya!

76
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.840
Just you watch. Isagi.

77
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.840
I win!

78
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.840
Not yet.

79
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.550
Give it your best shot. little man.

80
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.270
Come on.

81
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:17.750
To me. shorty!

82
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.620
Ah. damn. It's backs to the wall now.

83
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.080
If they score one more...

84
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.660
we lose.

85
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.040
Not to mention. that last play was huge.

86
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.090
If Naruhaya hadn't stolen the ball off me.

87
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.300
we could've tried to make a big comeback!

88
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.260
If I'd watched his movement.
 could I have prevented it?

89
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.990
No. he pressed me from behind.
 where I couldn't see him.

90
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.600
So. nope. there was no way 
I could've seen him coming.

91
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.650
After all. Naruhaya was in my blind spot.

92
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:06.610
My blind spot?

93
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.560
Wait. Hold on a minute.

94
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.710
Is Naruhaya always positioning 
himself where I can't see him?

95
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:22.700
If that's the case...

96
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.560
I see now!

97
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.840
Maybe I was wrong all along.

98
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:32.070
In soccer. one-on-ones don't just
happen when you have the ball.

99
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.170
"Off the ball."

100
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.850
It's still a one-on-one even
 when you're not on the ball.

101
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.560
If I think of every move that's made on the 
field as part of one continuous one-on-one...

102
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:48.780
That goes against everything 
I've considered normal up to now!

103
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:50.740
Hey. Isagi.

104
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.490
Let's go.

105
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.700
Yeah!

106
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.910
I'll get a goal back.

107
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:02.460
I know now that Naruhaya's 
always trying to find my blind spot.

108
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:08.300
Go find a book on how the human eye works 
and learn something. you piece of trash.

109
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.930
I see. Rin was also taking advantage
 of my blind spot back then.

110
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.380
Isagi! To me!

111
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.850
I've found the new jigsaw pieces I need.

112
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.060
My blind spot and "off the ball."

113
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:30.320
I'll shove these new pieces into my brain. 
and overwrite my concept of soccer!

114
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:36.230
If it lets me win. I have no issue tearing 
down everything that makes me who I am.

115
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.330
I'll be reborn again and again!

116
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.890
Whoever scores next wins.

117
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.800
First. we need to get hold of the ball.

118
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.810
Hey. are you listening. Isagi?

119
00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:04.800
Blind spot. Off the ball.

120
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.760
Blind spot. Off the ball.

121
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.190
Blind spot. Off the ball.

122
00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.650
Hey. Isagi.

123
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.020
I need you to shut up. genius.

124
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.990
I'm about to get to the good part.

125
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.120
So tell me.

126
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.770
What motivates you so much?

127
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.370
Shut up. genius.

128
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.480
I'm about to get to the good part!

129
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.080
Okay. striker. I'll take 
that as. "We're gonna win."

130
00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:34.730
Yeah.

131
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.750
Okay. is everyone ready?

132
00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.940
Thank you for the food!

133
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.150
Thank you for the food!

134
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.610
Dumplings again?

135
00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:55.750
Yum!

136
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.820
Hey. that was mine!

137
00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.380
Don't fight and don't complain.

138
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.790
These are free dumplings 
Sis brought home from work.

139
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:10.170
I'll make lots of money with cryptocurrency
 when I grow up and escape this life.

140
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.180
I'm gonna be a happy bride!

141
00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:13.920
Me. too!

142
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.830
I hate being poor.

143
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:19.440
Bro. what are you doing?

144
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.930
When the going gets tough. smile. 
The bad luck will disappear on its own.

145
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.480
C'mon. seriously?

146
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.140
Come on. everyone. Eat up.

147
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:46.090
Mom. Dad. It's already been 
two years since the accident.

148
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.690
We're doing fine.

149
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.300
It'll be okay. Sis.

150
00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.630
When I become a pro soccer player.

151
00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:02.540
I'll make lots of money 
and give you a life of luxury.

152
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.010
Then. I can...

153
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.930
Naruhaya Asahi-sama

154
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.930
You have been selected

155
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.930
to become a certified athlete

156
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:10.580
...protect everyone.

157
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.100
Good luck. Bro!

158
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.700
You're the star of the Naruhayas!

159
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:16.690
Don't lose. okay?

160
00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:18.740
You're the best in the world!

161
00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:19.870
Asahi.

162
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.160
Take this.

163
00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:24.740

I hope
you win

226
00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:55.480
Now you can't go for your usual shot
 into the top-right corner. King.

227
00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:00.150
Barou. they're ready for the shot 
direct from kickoff. so that's a no-go.

228
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:04.610
It's an easy two-on-one if we just 
take it closer to the goal instead.

229
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:06.580
Let's pass the ball around andâ€”

230
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.140
Go back to sleep. average Joe.

231
00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:11.120
I'll decide what I do.

232
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.250
I will live as I please and win as I please.

233
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.670
That is my...

234
00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.710
regal philosophy!

235
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.550
The left side instead of the right?

236
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.220
Crap! That's the best shot of the day!

237
00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.850
Lay down and die. lowly plebs!

238
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.850
Holy...

239
00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.440
The second ball!

240
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.480
It's mine!

241
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:41.800
I can get to it before Isagi.

242
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.190
Nagi's coming. too.

243
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.990
Which means he has to go left.

244
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:48.940
If I try to control it. 
they'll box me in and steal it!

245
00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.830
Shorty! Pass it to me!

246
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:52.480
What do I do? Pass?

247
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.130
That's a more certain...

248
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:55.870
No!

249
00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:01.710
What I need right now is 
that skill in front of goal!

250
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.380
To catch up to these geniuses.

251
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.220
I need a direct shot!

252
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.930
With this goal.

253
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:12.390
I will change my life!

254
00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.750
Let's go. Isagi. We'll link up and counter!

255
00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:27.030
Just then. Naruhaya tried to 
emulate my direct shot weapon.

256
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:29.750
To find the piece 
he's missing so he can score.

257
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:34.000
he took inspiration from my play
and went all-in on it coming off.

258
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:35.750
I see now.

259
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:36.750
Emulation!

260
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.290
Average Joe

261
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.290
Average Joe multiplied by average Joe!

262
00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:40.290
Average Joe

263
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.010
If I can fuse my weapon with Naruhaya's.

264
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.090
I might be able to take on the geniuses!

265
00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:48.300
Isagi...

266
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.060
Tch! I'll mark Nagi!

267
00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.350
Barou. you stop Isagi!

268
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:52.760
Don't order me around. shorty.

269
00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.270
I'll crush this donkey because I want to!

270
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:57.850
Off the ball.

271
00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:02.440
What I neglected to do without the ball 
before was watch the movement...

272
00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.040
of the other guy's eyes.

273
00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.080
Human eyes can only see 
what's in front of them.

274
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:13.760
Meaning we have to move our heads
 if we want to see what's around us.

275
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:18.750
Right now. Barou has to 
pay attention to me in front of him.

276
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:23.210
and Nagi. who's behind him 
and running with the ball.

277
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:26.210
But it's impossible to 
look at both of us at once.

278
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.930
That's why I'll wait for my
window of opportunity to get...

279
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.010
in his blind spot!

280
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.390
Barou will shift his weight 
in an attempt to respond.

281
00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.600
And I'll go the opposite way!

282
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.560
Right here. Nagi. Pass it to me!

283
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.270
I see you. striker.

284
00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:47.410
I will beat Barou one-on-one!

285
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.030
Hey. that's my footwork!

286
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:53.490
Simply emulating isn't enough.

287
00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:56.450
I have to go beyond...

288
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:58.700
and reach my new self...

289
00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.410
in the territory of the geniuses!

290
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.380
It only took this guy a split second...

291
00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:09.630
to take my skill...

292
00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.770
and devour it!

293
00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.880
Game over. Final score: 4-5.

294
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.860
Isagi!

295
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:22.960
Yeah!

296
00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.980
The winners are Team White. 
Isagi Yoichi and Nagi Seishiro.

297
00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:32.650
Why?

298
00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.310
Why isn't that me?

299
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.300
If that shot had gone in...

300
00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:45.920
Why?

301
00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.190
Why?!

302
00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.280
Damn it. Damn it!

303
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.220
It was a close run thing. Naruhaya.

304
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.430
Between you and me. 
either of us could have won it.

305
00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:00.470
Not true.

306
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:01.150
What?

307
00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:05.290
I also thought you and I were the same.

308
00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.470
But now that I've lost. I get it.

309
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.250
I needed your direct shot weapon.

310
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:18.180
So I tried to emulate it. But...

311
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:24.160
All I managed was a shallow imitation.

312
00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.930
But you were different.

313
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:32.490
In that moment. you took my weapon 
as your own and mastered it.

314
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:38.660
It's because you're not afraid to change.

315
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.230
Isagi. you're no average Joe.

316
00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.810
You're always prepared to 
tear down everything you are.

317
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:51.150
so you can rebuild anew and 
become the best version of yourself.

318
00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:52.990
You are...

319
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.820
a genius of adaptability!

320
00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:01.450
That's where the gap in our talents lies.

321
00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:08.660
Thank you. Naruhaya.

322
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:14.300
After going head-to-head 
with you. I'm now stronger.

323
00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.820
Stop that.

324
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.200
I don't need your pity.

325
00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.750
So. Isagi. who do you want to pick?

326
00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:26.370
Don't pity me...

327
00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.350
I know. Nagi.

328
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:36.490
I will... No. we will go higher.

329
00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:39.510
Join us. Barou.

330
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.780
This isn't where you bow out.

331
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.020
Naruhaya. Iâ€”

332
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.430
I know. You don't have to say anything.

333
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:54.100
Thank you. Isagi.

334
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.890
For knocking me down.

335
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.210
I'll win on your behalf. too.

336
00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:03.440
What are you on about. Isagi?

337
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:08.930
A guy soft and naÃ¯ve enough to say that
 will lose in no time in this place.

338
00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:14.980
My shot at this thing ended just now.

339
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.870
You can do it

340
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.870
Best 
in the 
world!

341
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.870
That's 
what 
you 
are!

342
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.870
Take
care
of
your
body

343
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.870
Good

344
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.870
Don't
lose

345
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.870
I hope
you win

346
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:26.550
I'm sorry.

347
00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.920
Seems like this is where my dream ends.

348
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.750
I hope
\h\hyou win

349
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.750
I hope
\h\hyou win

350
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.750
Don't
\h\h\hlose

351
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.750
Don't
\h\h\hlose

You can do it

357
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.750
You can do it

358
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.750

360
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.570
There are some dreams that don't come true.

361
00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.300
Isagi.

362
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.380
Win.

363
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.720
You have to...

364
00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.300
keep winning until the day you die.

365
00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.030
Yeah.

366
00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:53.280
Goodbye. geniuses.

367
00:18:55.190 --> 00:19:01.910
Blue Lock

368
00:18:56.190 --> 00:19:01.910
2nd Selection

369
00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:01.910
Naruhaya Asahi

370
00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.910
Disqualified

371
00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.660
24 hours earlier

372
00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.850
Who do you want as our third member?

373
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.370
Let's see...

374
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.330
Someone who complements our abilities.

375
00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:17.890
A good passer who knows how 
to control the balance of a trio.

376
00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.300
Hm? That guy...

377
00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:24.670
Wasn't he with Nagi? 
I think his name's Reo.

378
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:27.990
Hey. Are you okay?

379
00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.650
Shut up. Leave me alone.

380
00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:36.860
I bet he's just sulking because he got 
dumped unexpectedly by his pet. Nagi.

381
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.030
Huh?

382
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:39.950
We did. too.

383
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:43.470
We want to crush Isagi and 
Bachira for leaving us behind.

384
00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:47.510
What do you say. Reo? Wanna join us?

385
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:22.510
Calm down. you two.

386
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:25.430
Break Room

387
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.430
(for 3 people)

388
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.070
We just need to talk it out!

389
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.510
Huh? You wanna go?

390
00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:28.890
Like I said...

391
00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.110
I want to sleep on this bed.

392
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:33.760
No. the one who's 
sleeping on this bed is me.

393
00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.620
A fierce battle over a bed!

394
00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:40.270
Um. I'd like to sleep on that bed. too.

395
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.350
The bunk bed is too small.

396
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:45.550
and it shakes when the guy on the 
top bunk turns over. so I don't like it.

397
00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.200
So I'll be taking the single bed.

398
00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.300
Let's do rock. paper. scissors to decide.

399
00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.830
What rule says you get to pick first. anyway?

400
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.580
I am the rule.

401
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:58.830
You lost. so stop barking
and perish. former king!

402
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.910
Individually. I didn't lose.

403
00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:04.650
And my rule is absolute.

404
00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:08.180
That's what it means to live with me!

405
00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.890
What a hassle! A total hassle!
 You're a hassle. King!

406
00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:19.940
Perhaps I misjudged what it meant to
have these two geniuses as teammates.

407
00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:24.240
A

408
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:26.690

Additional Time!

423

Reo. a Maiden in Love?

424
00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:30.010
Reo. a Maiden in Love?

425
00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:31.020
That training was hard.

426
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:33.870
Chigiri
Hyoma

427

Kunigami
Rensuke

430
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.260
Good hustle.

431
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:33.870
Hm? Where's Reo?

432
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:40.790
Oh. he went to brush his teeth about 
30 minutes ago. and he hasn't come back yet.

433
00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.870
Hey! What are you up to. Reo?

434
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.240
Are you okay?

435
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:47.820
Nagi's coming back.

436
00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:50.510
Nagi's not coming back.

437
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.740
Nagi's coming back.

438
00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:53.560
Reo?

439
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.870
Nagi's not coming back.

440
00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:10.410
Mikage Reo

441
00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:10.410
Mikage Reo

442
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.880
Nagi's coming back.

443
00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:01.180
Nagi's not coming back.

444
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:04.540
Nagi's coming back.

445
00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:07.880
Nagi's not coming back.

446
00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.970
Nagi's... coming back.

447
00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.880
Don't assume I'll still be the same 
person when you come back.

448
00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.310
W-We should turn in. Kunigami.

449
00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:24.570
When he comes back. I'll be cold to Nagi.

450
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.130
Hang in there. Reo!

451
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:27.330
I won't be cold to Nagi.

452
00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.920
I will be cold to Nagi.

453
00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.350
I won't be cold to Nagi...
