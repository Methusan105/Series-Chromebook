1
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.160
Now. who should we pick?

2
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.580
Honestly. my brain hadn't 
even caught up at this point.

3
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.010
I think we should pick him.

4
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.930
What a coincidence. I want him. too.

5
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.560
I hadn't realized the meaning 
of what we could lose.

6
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.680
Join us...

7
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.310
Bachira Meguru.

8
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.930
Let's get moving.

9
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.980
Don't go dozing off. Bob Cut.

10
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.530
Aw. man. I wanted to be 
on Isagi's team to the end.

11
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.270
Guess I'll go. That is the rule.

12
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.300
But I'm not going to wait for you. Isagi.

13
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.370
If you want me. come and get me.

14
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:14.000
From here on. I'll have to chase after 
what I've lost to get it back again.

15
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.040
Episode 14

16
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.040
The Geniuses and
 the Average Joes

17
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.500
2nd Stage

18
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.500
2v2 Rivalry Battle

19
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.500
The Match-Up Room

20
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.500
So this is where you end up 
when you lose a three-on-three?

21
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.890
We seem to be the first ones here.

22
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:04.670
Yeah...

23
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:06.970
What do you wanna do?

24
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.750
Looks like there's an area where
 you can get some rest. Wanna go there?

25
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.180
We don't have time for resting.

26
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.890
If we lose again. we're done.

27
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.230
I'm sure we'll win the next one.
 Our last opponents were just too strong.

28
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.700
That's not the point.

29
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.010
I'm not like you.

30
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.570
I...

31
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.580
I couldn't do anything against them.

32
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.770
What are you talking about. Isagi? 
You scored a goal against them.

33
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.630
That was the result of our team play.

34
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.820
Well. that's how soccer works. right?

35
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.900
No!

36
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.550
I'm saying that when our team play
 breaks down. I have no weapon to fight with!

37
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.260
I can't trigger a chemical 
reaction like you and Bachira.

38
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.170
That's all there is to it.

39
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.710
If we lose the next one. 
I'm going to lose you. Nagi.

40
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.710
I won't get chosen.

41
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.890
If I were in their place. 
I wouldn't take me. either.

42
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.900
Don't give me that crap. Isagi.

43
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.140
What am I supposed to do
 when you're like that?

44
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.390
Huh?

45
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.150
I teamed up with you because I thought 
doing so would make me stronger.

46
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.410
So I can't have you acting all negative.

47
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.960
Get a grip. idiot.

48
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.360
So what. you're throwing it back at me?

49
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.690
Do better.

50
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.410
Reo would never whine like that.

51
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.800
What's that supposed to mean?!
 Go team up with Reo. then!

52
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.180
Don't compare me to him 
and shove your ideals onto me!

53
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.270
Well. what do you expect?
 I've never played soccer with anyone else.

54
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.010
Huh?!

55
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.090
So you mean you can't do 
anything without Reo. is that it?!

56
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.250
You can't do anything 
without Bachira. either.

57
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.530
Shut up.

58
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.880
You're right. and that's why I'm frustrated.

59
00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.720
Damn it.

60
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.250
If you want me. come and get me.

61
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.010
I'll follow the monster inside me.

62
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.560
What's wrong with that guy?

63
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.780
I'll prove that I can fight without Bachira.

64
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.380
Oh. maybe that's the
 point of this selection.

65
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.280
Huh?

66
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.610
I don't know a great deal
 about soccer yet. but...

67
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.150
Up to now. if someone on your 
team could turn zero into one.

68
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.740
the rest of the team could use team play
 to turn that one into 100. right?

69
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.580
But the second selection takes place 
on a smaller field with fewer players.

70
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.380
So each player's individual playstyle 
has a bigger influence on the team overall.

71
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.340
We're being tested 
on our individual skills.

72
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.840
I see.

73
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.620
So the team play that we tried. something that relies
 on someone's passes or plays. won't work.

74
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.770
Yeah.

75
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.100
It might work against 
those weaker than us.

76
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.350
but from here on out. individual strength 
becomes a minimum requirement.

77
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.420
Whoever you're playing with. 
or whoever you're playing against.

78
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.840
you've got to win one-on-one.

79
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.260
That's the key to surviving 
the second selection.

80
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.830
Oh. and one more thing. Isagi...

81
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.940
How do you get rid of
 this feeling of frustration?

82
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.400
Unfortunately. Nagi...

83
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.150
Winning.

84
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.810
That's the only way to ease the burning.

85
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.620
Barou?!

86
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.330
What is this?

87
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.180
If your team sucks. 
you get sent to this shithole?

88
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.850
1st Selection

89
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.850
Isn't there anyone strong here?

90
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.600
The key to surviving the second 
selection is individual strength.

91
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.550
If I don't get strong enough 
to beat this guy. I can't survive here.

92
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.090
Move. donkey. Don't get in my way.

93
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.870
But how do I beat Barou?

94
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.160
I didn't expect to see you here. 
Aren't you supposed to be the strongest?

95
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.750
Want to play us?

96
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.500
Right now. you might not be so hard to beat.

97
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:04.820
Huh?

98
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.730
Who's going to beat who?

99
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.790
Isagi and I will beat you.

100
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.140
You're an amateur who's only 
good at controlling the ball.

101
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.510
Do you want the king
to personally crush you?

102
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.010
You bark a lot for someone who lost. "King."

103
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.100
I'll beat you and make you my servant.

104
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.320
Wait. Nagi. Don't provoke him.

105
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.460
I still don't feel I can beat him...

106
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:37.770
It says right here. "You must wait 24 hours 
before choosing your next match-up." you two.

107
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.390
New BL Ranking

108
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:39.390
Naruhaya!

109
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:40.830
Who's that again?

110
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.150
Oh. he's my former teammate.

111
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.810
But wait. you teamed up with Barou?

112
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:46.620
Yup.

113
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:51.440
Our other player was that Nishioka guy
 nicknamed "Aomori's Messi." but...

114
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.460
New BL Ranking

115
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.530
When the game started. 
Barou just went off and scored four goals.

116
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.670
But the other team scored 
five goals first. and we lost.

117
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.750
Barou wasn't chosen 'cause he was too 
selfish and would've upset their balance.

118
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.650
So now. it's just the two of us.

119
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:08.050
We lost because you two were useless.

120
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.310
Stop acting so foolish.

121
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.080
Ah. come on now. Let's calm it down. yeah?

122
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.160
We don't have to rush into 
deciding to play these guys.

123
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.500
After all. if we lose 
the next game. we're done.

124
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.060
Right. Isagi?

125
00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.450
Huh? Um. yeah.

126
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.170
Hmph.

127
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.440
I won't run or hide.

128
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.180
I'll crush you. so come at me
 whenever you want.

129
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.910
you cowards.

130
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:35.750
Bye. Isagi!

131
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:36.990
Right.

132
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.470
Look. Isagi.

133
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:52.230
2nd Stage

134
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.380
It's almost like a jail.

135
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:52.230
Break Room

136
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:52.230
(for 2 people)

137
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.180
Well. it is called Blue Lock. after all.

138
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.190
There's a cafeteria and a bath.

139
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.230
so it's like a downgraded version 
of the facilities we had before.

140
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.490
The biggest difference is...

141
00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:58.550
you can take on Blue Lock Man
 in the training room.

142
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:59.650
Hey. Isagi.

143
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.740
Why didn't you say we'd play Barou?

144
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:06.220
If we want another teammate. 
we should pick him.

145
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.450
That's true. but at our current level...

146
00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.030
Then. what do we lack right now?

147
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.500
What became apparent 
in our game with Rin's team

148
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.630
is that our weapons only work 
when we receive passes.

149
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.470
Ah. I see.

150
00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:27.500
Mine is controlling the ball. 
and yours is your direct shot.

151
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:29.180
Yeah.

152
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.940
So if we don't have someone 
who understands our weapons

153
00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.760
and is really good at passing 
like Bachira or Reo. we can't shine.

154
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.450
Hm.

155
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.990
So how do we use our weapons 
without those passes?

156
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:52.990
If they dribble at us or come at us with 
quickness. long limbs. or crazy physiques...

157
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.030
One-on-one. we have no hope of winning.

158
00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.730
That's what we're lacking.

159
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.720
How do we win a one-on-one
 without those passes?

160
00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.340
That's extra hard.

161
00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.330
Sorry. I think I've reached my limit.

162
00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:11.930
Let's think on it some more tomorrow.

163
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.850
Sure. okay.

164
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.130
He sleeps like a mummy.

165
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.430
How can I win? What individual 
strengths do you need in a one-on-one?

166
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.500
2nd Stage

167
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.500
Cafeteria

168
00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:37.790
Looks like more people 
who lost came down here.

169
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:41.490
Forget that. Isagi. 
This is a nightmare. This cafeteria...

170
00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.290
only has natto and pickled radishes.

171
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.040
You clown. I'm used to this menu.

172
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.930
So what's the plan. Isagi?

173
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.120
Which team do you wanna take on?

174
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.930
Right.

175
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:58.600
Well. if we pick a weaker team. 
I'm sure we can win. but...

176
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.730
Adding a weak player to our team 
won't help us with the next stage.

177
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.810
and we'd probably just end up back here.

178
00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:09.070
And you'd likely be the one 
they take. so I'd be without you.

179
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:13.520
It'd be better to play against stronger 
guys so we can take a good player.

180
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:17.710
but that increases the risk of losing. 
so we gotta be careful who we choose.

181
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.910
I guess everyone else is being 
cautious too and thinking the same thing.

182
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:23.990
Yeah.

183
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:29.600
This is the Rivalry Battle. 
Simply winning won't do.

184
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.180
I have to think about who to 
team up with so I can move forward.

185
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.550
My direct shot weapon is improving.

186
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:46.080
But in an actual game. 
I couldn't do anything.

187
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:46.490
Blue Lock Man System

188
00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:46.490
Training Room

189
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:52.440
Others can create opportunities
by dominating one-on-one situations.

190
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:56.810
These are the monsters I need 
to surpass to move forward.

191
00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.340
The skill to create opportunities by 
dominating one-on-one situations...

192
00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:07.040
Maybe I need to experience it
 again to find a clue.

193
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.540
Ah. there you are.

194
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.760
Working hard. Isagi?

195
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.000
Naruhaya.

196
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.330
Have you decided on your next opponent?

197
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:17.720
No. not yet.

198
00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.930
Figured. Tough. ain't it?

199
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.480
If we lose the next one. that's it. 
No wonder we're all chicken.

200
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.810
Yeah. Plus. you don't want someone
 weak as a teammate going forward.

201
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:31.400
Exactly. So I've thought about it a lot and...

202
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.830
You and I have got to take risks.

203
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.400
Hm? What do you mean?

204
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:43.610
Well. you and me aren't the type of
 players who'll get picked if we lose.

205
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.950
We're in the same boat. aren't we?

206
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:50.700
Of course we're gonna freak out.

207
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.210
I've got Barou as a teammate. 
and you've got Nagi. y'know?

208
00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.600
There's no way we're getting
chosen in that situation.

209
00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.880
Well. I might not. but you...

210
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.740
There's no need to sugarcoat it.

211
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.480
After all. the guy I want...

212
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.080
is Nagi.

213
00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.490
Not you. Isagi.

214
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.600
You know that. right?

215
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:22.500
You have to team up with someone 
truly strong or you won't get any further.

216
00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:27.800
I mean. if you're serious about 
becoming the best striker in the world.

217
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.880
you can't play it safe here.

218
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.260
If you do. you're done.

219
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.500
So let's crush each other. Isagi.

220
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.290
Our dreams are at stake.

221
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.880
Don't chicken out.

222
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.840
This is Blue Lock. you know?

223
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:44.320
This guy...

224
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:50.070
You're on. As a matter of fact. 
I wanted to play you guys. too.

225
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.520
Then it's settled.

226
00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:57.030
Isagi Yoichi
Naruhaya Asahi

227
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:57.030
Nagi Seishiro
Barou Shouei

228
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:57.030
Match-Up

229
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:57.030
Confirmed

230
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.110
Come on. Isagi. Attempt number 50.

231
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.820
Right!

232
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.200
Too obvious.

233
00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:15.100
Barou's weapon is his 
super-accurate mid-range shot

234
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.920
from the left of the goal 
with a max range of 27 meters.

235
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:23.920
Plus his outstanding physique that lets him
 steamroll through to get into range.

236
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.510
Right?

237
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.720
Right.

238
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.700
This is bad. Isagi.
 I can't practice that against you.

239
00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.420
I don't mind playing those guys.
 but do you have a plan?

240
00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.140
Honestly. I don't know 
until I go up against them.

241
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.120
Yeah. that's fair.

242
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.130
Unlike in a regular match. 
the teams are way smaller.

243
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.060
so one-on-one situations become
 that much more important.

244
00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:47.860
Yeah.

245
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.990
The only way to figure out how to defeat 
Barou is by playing against him.

246
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.160
That's such a gamble.

247
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.450
In order for us to survive.

248
00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:01.290
we need to find an individual strength
 good enough to beat Barou

249
00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:04.210
in a one-on-one situation 
during the game.

250
00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:07.210
Okay. I'll mark Barou from the start.

251
00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.910
Isagi. you take the little one.

252
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:10.650
Right.

253
00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.370
So let's crush each other. Isagi.

254
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.030
Our dreams are at stake.

255
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:22.270
Crushing those guys will help me 
to evolve and get to the next stage.

256
00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:27.190
If I lose here. then it means 
this was the extent of my worth.

257
00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.530
That's enough now. shorty. I'm going to bed.

258
00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.310
Don't get in my way in the game tomorrow.

259
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.870
Just go keep yourself busy 
somewhere away from me. donkey.

260
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.460
You got it. King.

261
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:44.950
Damn it.

262
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.340
You can do it. Best

263
00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:47.460
You can do it. Best

264
00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.460
You can do it. Best

265
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:51.510
I don't... want it to end yet...

266
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:48.920
Caramel

267
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.050
Caramel

268
00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:52.430
Caramel

269
00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.810
Time Until the Match:

270
00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:02.750
2nd Stage. Rivalry Battle: 2 vs 2

271
00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:04.970
Looking forward to it. King.

272
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:07.270
Did you practice kneeling?

273
00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.220
You're dead.

274
00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.610
You're the one who'll be my servant.

275
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.810
Naruhaya.

276
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.160
I'm really going to crush you. 
so don't hold back.

277
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.910
No need to tell me that.

278
00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:30.090
He's got mad presence.

279
00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.700
Bring it on. King.

280
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.210
Let's go head-to-head.

281
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:35.510
If I can't beat him. I won't get anywhere.

282
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:37.510
You call that dribbling?

283
00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.890
Your timing and use of space are garbage.

284
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.740
Do you realize who you're up against?

285
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.400
Show some respect.

286
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.110
Crap.

287
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.080
Isagi!

288
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.130
Seriously? I've gotta stop him.

289
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:53.380
Naruhaya's making a move. too. What do I do?

290
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.870
No. I have to stay put.
 Barou's range is 27 meters.

291
00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:02.450
What? That's 28... No. it's got 
to be at least 29 meters. right?

292
00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:12.130
Barou's also evolving in Blue Lock.

293
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:16.310
Jeez. Isagi. His range is getting bigger.

294
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:17.470
Yeah.

295
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:21.680
But I've got to find it
 during this game. And I will.

296
00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.640
I'll find a way to win 
one-on-one situations.

297
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:30.520
Leaving Barou aside. if I can fend off this guy
 one-on-one. we've got a fifty-fifty chance.

298
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.410
Damn. he's tenacious.

299
00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:37.230
Even against Naruhaya. 
my dribbling's useless?

300
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.410
Then. should I hit it to exactly 
where Nagi will want it?

301
00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:44.120
No. I'm not skilled enough 
to pull off a pass like that.

302
00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:46.460
Naruhaya's blocking the passing lanes.

303
00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.910
and Barou will intercept
any pass that isn't precise.

304
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.500
Aw. man. What do I do?

305
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.970
Pass it. Isagi. Just do it.
 Send the ball...

306
00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:58.000
to wherever the space is.

307
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.590
Where the hell are you aiming. donkey?

308
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:04.640
You won't get past me 
with a shitty pass like that.

309
00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.350
I know that. King.

310
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:08.810
But forget about that. 
because I've found it.

311
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:09.770
Huh?

312
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.680
The way to beat you.

313
00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:17.020
When we go head-to-head and I pause. 
I can't avoid Barou's press and charge.

314
00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.840
So the trick is to keep him chasing me.

315
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.810
Because this happened before.

316
00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:27.870
I did those things instinctively. 
but now. they're starting to make sense.

317
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:32.520
They become formulas
 that are reproducible.

318

336
00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:35.980
I don't need special passes to me.

337
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.510
I can breathe life into a ball
 with my first touch.

338
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.720
See? This is my rhythm.

339
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:44.430
Try and take it off me. King.

340
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:47.930
Now I'm the god of this field.

341
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.360
Nagi. just how insanely quickly
 are you capable of evolving?

342
00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.750
We can beat him. Isagi.

343
00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.070
It's your turn now.

344
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:08.090
Did he master his formula of how 
to win a one-on-one in that one play?

345
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:11.370
I can receive it with my back turned.
 I won't lose anymore.

346
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.100
You bastard.

347
00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.970
I'll crush you.

348
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:15.960
Yeah.

349
00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.960
Come on. Isagi. Let's both press him.

350
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.360
Huh? But what about 
marking Naruhaya?

351
00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.630
It'll be fine.

352
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:29.220
He's the "king." He won't pass 
right after we got the upper hand.

353
00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.430
Barou! I'm open!

354
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:32.830
Shut up. shorty.

355
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:33.560
I'm...

356
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:35.190
Got it!

357
00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.190
Nice. Isagi! Pass it!

358
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.400
Oh no you don't!

359
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.000
Nagi's weapon is his ball control.

360
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.450
Nagi controlled the ball
 with his back before.

361
00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.700
Nagi had his back to goal.

362
00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.150
and the standard move for a defender
 is to get tight so he can't turn.

363
00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:53.210
Nagi took advantage of that and eluded the 
defender with an unpredictable first touch.

364
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.290
That's his new strategy!

365
00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.650
But they'll be ready for it now.

366
00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:02.680
So next time. the defender keeps
 his distance. just like Naruhaya's doing.

367
00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:06.620
Which means Nagi can 
face forward and play freely

368
00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:10.600
without any pressure from the defender.

369
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:16.400
That means the pass to Nagi can be
 a straightforward one. like a shot.

370
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:20.720
What he'll use here will be nothing like his 
earlier control. It'll be a nice. cushioned...

371
00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.820
"black hole" takedown!

372
00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:27.610
Because Naruhaya hung back. he won't be
 where he needs to be to block the shot.

373
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.380
This is Nagi's strength.

374
00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.450
A generating takedown 
that breathes life into a ball.

375
00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:35.580
and an absorbing takedown
 that kills the ball dead.

376
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.210
By fully utilizing these two takedowns.

377
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.880
Nagi Seishiro's formula is complete!

378
00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.840
Okay. three more goals.

379
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.750
I want to find a way 
to dominate one-on-ones!

380
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:55.530
Stop yapping. you lowly plebs.

381
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:57.900
I can beat...

382
00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.480
both of you by myself!

383
00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.070
Crap! Just like Rin did!

384
00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:05.670
So close!

385
00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:08.490
His shooting sense is amazing.

386
00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:09.940
I can't let him shoot again.

387
00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.240
This loose ball is mine!

388
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.740
Naruhaya?! He recovered so quickly!

389
00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.120
Shorty. pass it to me!

390
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.700
I know. King!

391
00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:20.000
Take that!

392
00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:22.550
Damn.

393
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.350
This is bad. Barou's ability to score 
is more or less the same as Nagi's.

394
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:31.500
Which means the key to winning this game
 is in the hands of Naruhaya and me.

395
00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:35.850
Hey. Isagi.

396
00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:40.560
Do you know why my team 
wanted to play you?

397
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.900
What? Isn't it because you want Nagi?

398
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:47.030
Sure. that's part of it.

399
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.490
But the main reason 
was that we thought...

400
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.330
we could beat you. Isagi.

401
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:55.780
Huh?

402
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:56.750
Running at

403
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:56.750
Time

404
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:56.750
Running at

405
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:56.750
Time

406
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:59.860
I know this because 
I fought alongside you.

407
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.170
I know what you can and can't do.

408
00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.340
Isagi. you're not the type 
who's able to fight alone.

409
00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.300
This guy...

410
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:15.260
Unlike Chigiri. Kunigami. and Bachira. 
you can't score a goal by yourself.

411
00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:19.190
You've only survived this long
because people bigged you up.

412
00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.660
You're not a genius like Barou or Nagi.

413
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:24.650
Me and you...

414
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:27.320
We're both just average Joes.

415
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:29.400
What are you doing. Isagi?

416
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.150
Pass it!

417
00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.050
Crap!

418
00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:34.990
Pathetic.

419
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:36.620
Isagi. let's stop him!

420
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:38.330
It's coming.

421
00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:41.290
Here comes Barou's charge!

422
00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:52.160
He passed?!

423
00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.630
And back to me. shorty.

424
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.090
No chance.

425
00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.940
I wanna catch up with you geniuses.

426
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:03.650
He got us! Wait. that's right! 
Naruhaya's weapon is...

427
00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:05.610
Mine is getting in behind.

428
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:11.430
I can't even beat Naruhaya!

429
00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:15.250
A

430
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:18.040
Blue Lock. Additional Time.

431
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:15.410
Additional Time!

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:18.040
Additional Time!

445
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.540
Welcome back.

446
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.020
The "Top 3" and Bachira

447
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.020
The "Top 3" and Bachira

448
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.330
Tokimitsu Aoishi

449
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.330
Tokimitsu Aoishi

450
00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.330
Again. it's nice to meet you. Bachira—

451
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:24.590
Bachira Meguru

452
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:24.590
Bachira Meguru

453
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.590
That was a nice bath.

454
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:27.810
H-Hey! Wh-Why are you 
walking around butt naked?!

455
00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:31.020
Hm? As a human being. 
I return to the state of my birth.

456
00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.680
Is that some kind of wise saying?!

457
00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:38.020
I thought I could make a new friend. 
but it turns out he's another weirdo!

458
00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.510
Hey. naked guy.

459
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:40.430
What's up?

460
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:43.640
I acknowledge your free spirit. 
but at least cover up in front.

461
00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:46.690
Aryu Jyubei

462
00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:46.690
Aryu Jyubei

463
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.690
Or I'll punish you for 
glam indecent exposure.

464
00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.690
GLAM

465
00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.690
GLAM

466
00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:48.470
Oh. sorry.

467
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:50.260
But it feels good. y'know?

468
00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.610
Wanna give it a try?

469
00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:51.820
Glammmmm

470
00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:53.240
I undress!

471
00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:58.740
Itoshi Rin

472
00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:58.740
Itoshi Rin

473
00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:52.160
Glammmmm

474
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.530
Glammmmm

475
00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:57.330
Glammmmm

476
00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:57.740
What the heck are you doing. you two?!

477
00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:58.740
Glammmmm

478
00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.860
Hmph. Isn't there anyone
 normal in this room?

479
00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.110
You're one to talk.
