1
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.450
I was born to prove this talent of mine.

2
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.630
Using these legs to outrun everyone
was a joy that was only available to me.

3
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.350
I was going to be the best 
striker in the world someday.

4
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.840
Back then. I had no doubts about that being the future that awaited me.

5
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.750
But...

6
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.020
Episode 7

7
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.020
Rush

8
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.990
Good job. Team Z.

9
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.370
You won't get away with this!
 I'll kill you. Kuon!

10
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.900
Cool it. Raichi.

11
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.290
Do you want a red card?

12
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.650
So you've betrayed us. huh. Kuon-chan?

13
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.270
What are we gonna do? It's 12-on-10 now.

14
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.240
Damn it.

15
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.600
I can't let it end like this!

16
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.010
I'll crush them!

17
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.430
I told you. man.

18
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.510
Kuon-chan told us everything.

19
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.690
Your weapons. your tactics. all of it!

20
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.810
Take you. Isagi Yoichi. for example.

21
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.230
While you have 
outstanding spatial awareness.

22
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.240
you're a dunce who 
can't do anything by himself!

23
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.330
Just give it up. Isagi-kun.

24
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.970
As a sport. soccer is 11 against 11.

25
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.540
If it's 12-on-10...

26
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.340
you have no chance of winning.

27
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.010
Here he comes. Defend!

28
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.840
Not only do they know our tactics. we're at 
a total disadvantage playing 10 against 12.

29
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.720
If they score again. 
we won't be able to turn this around...

30
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.180
Iemon!

31
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.440
There!

32
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.900
Nice. Iemon!

33
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.440
Get the loose ball! One goal's 
all we need! Let's focus on not losing.

34
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.300
We only need to tie.

35
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.700

I'll defend this goal if it kills me!

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.190
Get it. Chigiri!

81
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.940
You're so slow.

82
00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.840
Don't worry. Today. we'll end 
your soccer career for good.

83
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.000
You just stand there and watch!

84
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.450
The hell are you doing. Chigiri?!

85
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.800
Don't just stop!

86
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.060
Shut up.

87
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.870
I'm...

88
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.130
Listen up. new members!

89
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.070
We're the Wanima brothers. the two star
players of Rakosute Business High School.

90
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.070
a mainstay in the National High 
School Soccer Championship.

91
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.660
"Respect your supreme seniors!"

92
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.730
That's what my bro says.

93
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:30.490
Excuse me.

94
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.290
Hm?

95
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.380
I came to this school to win the championship 
so I can make a name for myself.

96
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.000
Could you please get rid of this 
unproductive hierarchy you've got?

97
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.630
Hm? And who exactly are you?

98
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.590
I'm Chigiri Hyoma.

99
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.980
If I beat you. will you please zip it?

100
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.440
So fast!

101
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.760
What's with this guy?

102
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.480
Let's go with one up top again in the next 
match to take advantage of Chigiri's speed.

103
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.970
Becoming national champs
isn't just a dream now!

104
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.910
Rakosute Business High School

105
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.860
"Don't get cocky just 'cause Coach favors you."

106
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.620
That's what my bro says.

107
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.330
Whatever. It's simply a matter of 
whether you have talent or not.

108
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.480
That so. Mr. Genius?

109
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.710
Excuse me.

110
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.080
Talent isn't dished out equally.

111
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.180
I am one of the chosen.

112
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.260
The day I outran everyone for 
the first time at the age of six.

113
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.890
soccer became everything to me.

114
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.620
In this world. there are those who 
have talent and those who don't.

115
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.900
Striker to Watch

116
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.900
Striker to Watch

117
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.900
Chigiri Hyoma

118
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.110
And I was born to prove this talent of mine.

119
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.440
\hRakosute First-Year\h\h\hChigiri

"I was born to prove myself"

126
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.420
If you keep this up. you'll rocket onto 
the national scene. Your feelings on that?

127
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.290
Nothing special. I mean. I can do more.

128
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.310
I'll do my best.

129
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.810
Chigiri-kun!

130
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.210
He's the genius!

131
00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.960
Using these legs to outrun everyone
was a joy that was only available to me.

132
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.830
I was going to be the best 
striker in the world someday.

133
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.970
Back then. I was in no doubt that
that was the future that awaited me.

134
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.740
It's a right ACL tear.

135
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.320
Hyoma-kun's leg muscles have
 developed in a unique way.

136
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.450
which explains why 
he's so good at sprinting.

137
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.110
If he were to experience 
a tear in the same place again.

138
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.710
it would be difficult for him 
to continue playing soccer.

139
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.710
Isn't that the former genius?

140
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.020
Come on.

141
00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.160
Oh? It's been a while. Mr. Genius (lol).

142
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.690
Why are you here?

143
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:07.670
What are you worth now that you can 
no longer run and your talent's in tatters?

144
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.690
"It's simply a matter of whether 
you have a talent or not." Right?

145
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.170
Serves you right. former genius!

146
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.060
Damn it.

147
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.740
Damn it!

148
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.550
Rakosute Business 
High School

149
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.550
Hey. everyone. Chigiri is back.

150
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.790
Good job on your rehabilitation.

151
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.590
Just take your time to get back into it.

152
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:35.760
Right.

153
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.910
Hey. what's the matter. Mr. Genius (lol)?

154
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:47.030
Is this it? What happened to those 
nimble feet you were so proud of?

155
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:48.820
Shut up. Mind your own business.

156
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.880
You scared to sprint 'cause 
you might damage your knee again? Huh?

157
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.080
Shut up!

158
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.500
I'm not scared of 
wrecking my right leg again.

159
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:08.940
All this time. I truly believed I could 
become number one in the world.

160
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.890
I'm scared of losing who I am.

161
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:31.020
Ever since then. I've been 
looking for a way to give up.

162
00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.060
Five more minutes.

163
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.430
Five more minutes. and we lose.

164
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.540
And then. after that...

165
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.730
I can put an end to my soccer career.

166
00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.630
Run. Chigiri!

167
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.130
It's not...

168
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.090
It's not over yet!

169
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.940
Nice. Raichi and Kunigami!

170
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.350
Go get the loose ball!

171
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:16.610
Isagi. one more time!

172
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.700
Right!

173
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.900
Come on now. It'll be the same outcome
no matter how many times you try.

174
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.000
We know all your weapons and tactics.

175
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.460
And it's 12 against 10!

176
00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:31.040
Not long left. so let's defend our lead. guys!

177
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.330
Damn it! What do we do?

178
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.130
If we don't break through their 
defense. we can't do a thing.

179
00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.930
Bachira's being marked constantly.

180
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.850
Kunigami has no space to take a shot.

181
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.520
If I play it into the area...

182
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.040
No. that won't work.
 because we're outnumbered.

183
00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.020
Find it.

184
00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.210
Think.

185
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.540
There has to be a route
to goal somewhere...

186
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.780
What's this. Isagi-kun?

187
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.240
You don't still believe you can win
 if you just refuse to give up. do you?

188
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.280
Matches don't allow for 
naïve thinking like that.

189
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:06.870
Even if you don't give up. 
the game ends when the game ends.

190
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.960
See? It's nearly over.

191
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.790
You're going to lose.

192
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:12.860
Shit.

193
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.130
A-Additional time! We've got three minutes!

194
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.470
This is bad! Isagi. pass the ball!

195
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:20.430
The ball!

196
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.460
No... I don't want it to end here.

197
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.350
If we can't use anyone's weapons...

198
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.730
I'll tear them apart myself!

199
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:32.360
Hey. what the hell? Number 11 
has skills we didn't know about?

200
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.480
Isagi...

201
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.400
Has he gone berserk?!

202
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.360
I will score!

203
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:41.910
Nice interception. bro!

204
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.620
Don't scare us like that. buddy! 
Your dribbling sucks!

205
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.330
Hey! Isagi. c'mon!

206
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:49.960
Don't be a ball hog!

207
00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.850
You can't do it alone. idiot!

208
00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:56.690
What's he doing?

209
00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:59.380
Is he a moron?

210
00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.380
I will score!

211
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:01.470
I will!

212
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:03.880
Pass it around!

213
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.560
Coordinate with Isagi and 
press them! There's no time!

214
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.890
Get the ball back!

215
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.790
I told you guys it's useless!

216
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.110
Defend! Keep it away from them!

217
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:15.560
Stop.

218
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.400
Stop already.

219
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.820
Just stop. Isagi.

220
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:24.570
Stop chasing the ball 
with that glint in your eye.

221
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.170
Stop believing in yourself 
and playing soccer like that...

222
00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:30.250
Chigiri!

223
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:31.670
Snap out of it! Get the ball!

224
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:36.420
Outta my way.

225
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.340
Pass it. Isagi!

226
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.300
Hey. are you listening?

227
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.600
Did you tell me to get out
 of your way? Screw you.

228
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.660
If we lose. I can put an end to this.

229
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.190
I can give up on soccer and be at peace.

230
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.420
Ah. damn.

231
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.270
Why am I...

232
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.020
I see now.

233
00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:07.640
Isagi. you're just like I was back then.

234
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.100
Believing you can be
 the best in the world.

235
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.170
and putting everything 
you've got into soccer...

236
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.210
Get the ball! If they get it. we lose!

237
00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.210
What am I scared of?

238
00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.800
Rakosute Undefeated

239
00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.800
Rakosute Undefeated

240
00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.800
FW\h\hChigiri Hyoma

241
00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.800
Hat-Trick Hero

242
00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.800
Hat-Trick Hero

243
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.800
No longer being a genius?

244
00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.690
Injuring my right leg again?

245
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.140
Or not being able to play soccer anymore?

246
00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:35.730
The truth is. none of that really mattered.

247
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.970
It's heading for the touchline!
 This match is over!

248
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.320
What I can't afford to lose...

249
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.070
What I have to believe in...

250
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:50.490
It's the rush I'm feeling
 watching you play.

251
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.330
It's still in play! Isagi. pass it!

252
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.210
I don't care anymore.

253
00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.080
If it tears again. so be it.

254
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.460
I don't care if this is my last play.

255
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.010
Are you ready. right leg?

256
00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.300
The best striker in the world... is me!

257
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:14.770
I can smell a goal!

258
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:16.670
Let's go! One last play!

259
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.770
You can't do it alone! Pass the ball. Isagi!

260
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.400
No... I can see it.

261
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.110
I can feel it.

262
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:27.860
Running down the opposite flank. 
hugging the touchline...

263
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.070
I see you!

264
00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.030
To me. Isagi!

265
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:32.620
Are you ready?

266
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.040
Show off your weapon. Chigiri!

267
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.530
Huh? Where are you passing to?!

268
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:42.140
There's no one from our team over there!

269
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.220
Idiot! We'll clear it. and it's game over!

270
00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.530
Get the ball. Kuon-chan!

271
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:47.840
Gotcha.

272
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:51.180
Chigiri... At that speed...

273
00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.810
Yes. I can...

274
00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.020
reach it!

275
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:03.330
All right. it's clear. And that's game over—

276
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:03.820
Move.

277
00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.280
Outrun them!

278
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.860
Let this rush carry you!

279
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:12.990
What's with that crazy speed?
 Were you hiding that?!

280
00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:15.750
Is he for real?

281
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:16.960
So fast!

282
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.250
Stop. stop!

283
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.710
Stop him!

284
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.170
I haven't felt this in so long.

285
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:29.130
This sensation of kicking into 
high gear and eating up the ground...

286
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.340
Aw. jeez. he can run now?

287
00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.760
Let's stop him. bro! Foul him if we have to!

288
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:39.210
I don't care about being a genius or 
never playing another game of soccer again.

289
00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:40.980
Much more important than that...

290
00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:45.730
is the joy I felt the day 
I played soccer for the first time.

291
00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:50.700
Outrunning someone is what 
soccer's all about for me!

292
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.780
It's a joy only I get to experience!

293
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:56.620
What's Chigiri doing?

294
00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:01.380
Don't tell me he's trying to 
catch up to the pass he just hit!

295
00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.390
Stop him. bro!

296
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.670
This is it. This is what I was looking for.

297
00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:12.930
The only time I believe in myself 
is when I beat someone's speed!

298
00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:14.640
Go. Chigiri!

299
00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:17.320
Good. I caught up—

300
00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:17.850
Huh?

301
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.140
Accelerate.

302
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.350
Go even faster!

303
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.060
Get fired up!

304
00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.650
Eyes on the prize!

305
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:26.620
Come out. goalie!

306
00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.230
Get to it first!

307
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.900
Stop him!

308
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.160
Once more...

309
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.470
I will dream!

310
00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:49.260
To become the best in the world. I want...

311
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.050
another chance to play soccer!

312
00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:03.060
Hell. yeah!

313
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.700
Check it out. Isagi.

314
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.380
Check it out. you guys!

315
00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.480
This is Chigiri Hyoma!

316
00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.940
Yeah!

317
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.400
All right!

318
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.520
Yes!

319
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.110
Heck. yeah!

320
00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.320
We stay afloat for now.

321
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:17.530
Chigiri!

322
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:19.370
Isagi...

323
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:24.070
You're amazing. Those legs 
of yours can really motor!

324
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:26.760
It's your fault.

325
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:32.790
Watching you fired me up. 
and next thing I knew. I was sprinting.

326
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:38.780
I didn't know what was 
important to me anymore.

327
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.770
But that wasn't it.

328
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.810
The invincible guy I was
before the injury is no more.

329
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:49.650
But the guy I am now 
is one that gets fired up

330
00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:53.610
even when I'm risking
never playing soccer again.

331
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.960
I want to put my faith 
in this new version of me.

332
00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:00.220
Thanks. Isagi.

333
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.740
I'm going to run until this 
leg of mine no longer works.

334
00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:07.550
Until this fire goes out.

335
00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.340
Yeah. let's fight together.

336
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:15.470
Together?

337
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:20.790
Don't get me wrong. slowpoke. 
This is Blue Lock.

338
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.100
You're right.

339
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:28.480
I'll become the best in the world!

340
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.570
Yeah. give it your best shot.

341
00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.470
I'll become the best in the world.

342
00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.820
Yo. man! You've got an amazing weapon!

343
00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.490
You're our savior. young lady!

344
00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.200
Looks like you weren't just a selfish lady.

345
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.540
Shut up.

346
00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.370
If it wasn't for me. we'd have lost.

347
00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:47.840
Yeah. Chigiri. This draw is huge.

348
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.000
We're hanging on by a thread. huh?

349
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.690
I still ain't forgiving Kuon. though.

350
00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:54.340
What is this bullshit?!

351
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:57.690
You were gonna help us win!
 That was the deal!

352
00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.300
Why'd you keep Chigiri's leg a secret from us?!

353
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.630
Y-You're wrong! I really didn't know about it!

354
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.810
Stop lying! I'll make sure 
you stay down for the count!

355
00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.020
Stop it. all of you!

356
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.810
Huh? What do you want? 
Want me to kill you. too?!

357
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:10.770
Stop it.

358
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.110
Keep your hands off my team.

359
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.900
Hey. Kuon ran away!

360
00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.360
Not so fast. you bastard!

361
00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:24.950
Match 7

362
00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:24.950
Match 8

363
00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:24.950
Building 5's seventh and 
eighth matches are complete.

364
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:27.540
The next match is the final one.

365
00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:30.880
Isagi

366
00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:30.880
Bachira

367

Imamura

Chigiri

Kunigami

Igaguri

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:30.880
Raichi

Iemon

Operation:
3x3 All Stars!

377
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.370
But I mean. it's a miracle 
we even managed to draw.

378
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:37.760
When Isagi went berserk. 
I had no idea what was gonna happen.

379
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.220
I'm sorry. There wasn't 
any other way to attack.

380
00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.630
You're not the type of player 
who can take people on one-on-one.

381
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.680
Do it again. and I'll kill you.

382
00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:50.810
Let's go eat!

383
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:52.360
I'm starving!

384
00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:58.240
Our final match is against Team V. the only
 team yet to lose a match in Building 5.

385
00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.060
I don't care who our opponent is.

386
00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.390
All we gotta do is win.

387
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:05.740
But we have no chance with just ten of us.

388
00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:06.580
That's true.

389
00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.580
Hold up. everyone.

390
00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:16.460
Okay? I'll give you info on Team Z.
I'm sure you could stop them from scoring.

391
00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:20.060
That way. I can advance
as the team's top scorer.

392
00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:24.780
If I do. I promise I'll give you some 
advantage in the second selection.

393
00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.450
He's at it again.

394
00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:28.970
I could sabotage other teams. 
or provide assists for your team...

395
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:27.600
He needs to die.

396
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.980
Cool it.

397
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:34.890
Anyway. making a deal with me will up your
 chances of passing the second selection.

398
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:37.440
What do you say? Why not work with me?

399
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.440
I refuse.

400
00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.960
Sounds like a bother.

401
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.150
How boring.

402
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.990
Those guys are from Team V...

403
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:48.270
There is no merit at all 
in what you are proposing.

404
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.950
In fact. it would be a demerit.

405
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:55.370
In other words. the priority of this 
business is an initiative method.

406
00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.510
Team V

408
00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.510
Um. how was that? 
Did I use those words right?

409
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.500
Knock that off. Zantetsu. you half-wit.

410
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.130
Stop trying to make your 
dumb ass sound smarter. idiot.

411
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.850
Anyhow. I hate lame guys and boring guys.

412
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.940
Team V

And you're both.

415
00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.810
Whatever. Reo. I can't be 
bothered with this deal.

I mean. even chewing
 is getting tiresome.

419
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:21.830
Let's go back now. Gimme a piggyback.

420
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:25.950
Nagi. I brought you here 
because you said you were hungry.

421
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.580
Sorry. It's too much hassle.

422
00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.750
You're just going to let 
this steak go to waste?

423
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:35.670
Hm. But eating the scraps makes me 
look like a simpleton. doesn't it?

424
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:36.980
What should I do?

425
00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:37.980
Wait!

426
00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.460
Please listen to me!

427
00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:43.220
Hey. Reo. Why's this guy so desperate?

428
00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.420
He wants to win.

429
00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.720
Mmm. yummy.

430
00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.580
Huh. So you can't win
 unless you try this hard?

431
00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:51.930
Being weak sounds like a hassle.

432
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:55.640
I'd rather just quit playing.

433
00:20:56.170 --> 00:21:00.820
Hey. Reo. Is soccer really that 
fun to play even if you lose?

434
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.270
Hey. hold on a second.

435
00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:08.790
Who are you?

436
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.080
Don't underestimate soccer!

437
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.040
Like I said. who are you?

438
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.540
I'm Team Z's Isagi Yoichi.

439
00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.090
I'm the one who will defeat you!

440
00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.190

No. that's not it.
 It just doesn't feel right.

But you know. fashion isn't 
just about functionality.

It's also about how it pumps you up.

Hey. lookin' good. A new Chigiri.
