12
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:05.041

repmaker. that's for sure.</i>

14

<i>Well.
target's a corp. ain't it?</i>

15
00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:12.882
<i>Convoy like that. think I know which one.</i>

16
00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:15.093
<i>Arasaka.</i>

17
00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.888
<i>Now. I ain't trying</i>
to water down the pot.

18
00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:21.307
<i>Half a mill a head is nice and all.</i>

19
00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:23.101
<i>but really think five of us is enough?</i>

20
00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:26.146
Security footprint
on the convoy's peculiarly small.

21
00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:28.565
'Saka probably posting a limited crew

22
00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:31.484
to cast a short shadow.
Keep a low profile.

23
00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:34.028
Let's strategize our revamp after today.

24
00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:36.030
<i>I don't know about that. chooms.</i>

25
00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:37.699
<i>No need to overthink this.</i>

26
00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:40.243
<i>Smash. grab. deliver. It's what we do.</i>

27
00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:41.744
<i>Easy peasy.</i>

28
00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:43.037
<i>Biz as usual.</i>

29
00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:45.748
<i>"Biz as usual". my ass.</i>

30
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:49.544
<i>The cyberskeleton. Do you
truly believe he can manage it?</i>

31
00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:53.298
Well. Arasaka does. at least.

32
00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:56.759
After seeing his chemistry
mesh so well with the Sandevistan.

33
00:02:56.843 --> 00:03:00.388
It's why Tanaka wanted David back
at the Academy so badly.

34
00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:02.473
To use him as a lab rat for test runs.

35
00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:05.685
<i>And the girl
shredded David's file.</i>

36
00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:10.023
<i>She hoped Arasaka's plans for him
would simply disappear.</i>

37
00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:13.192
That's how I see it.
Praying Tanaka tied up a loose end.

38
00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:14.277
<i>Hmm.</i>

39
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.029
<i>So. Maine and Dorio</i>

40
00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:18.239
<i>were mere collateral damage in her scheme.</i>

41
00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.367
Sure. In hindsight.

42
00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:24.162
<i>So much carnage
for one so petite.</i>

43
00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:25.622
<i>I wonder.</i>

44
00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:29.000
<i>How many has she killed
to save this one punk?</i>

45
00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:36.799
<i>I dove a little deeper.</i>

46
00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.636
<i>Learned she was once an Arasaka operative.</i>

47
00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:41.846
<i>Corp groomed her as a kid</i>

48
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.224
<i>to mine data in the Old Net.</i>

49
00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:47.685
<i>Explains her cutting through
Arasaka ICE as if it were soap.</i>

50
00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.980
Simply too perfect.

51
00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:53.900
She will be the cherry we drop on top.

52
00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:57.028
Our guarantee Arasaka
welcomes us with open arms.

53
00:03:57.111 --> 00:04:00.240
This girl's a fast-lane ticket
up the corporate rungs!

54
00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:03.326
<i>Didn't see you
as such a simp corpo climber.</i>

55
00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:04.661
What are fixers

56
00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:06.621
if not glorified pet owners

57
00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:10.083
who keep their mercenary hounds well fed?

58
00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:13.378
There is but one true measure
of success in Night City.

59
00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:15.838
One standing in the corporate world.

60
00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:19.509
And to keep climbing. I shall need
your continued support.

61
00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:22.136
<i>Don't think you dangled me
out there enough already?</i>

62
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.306
You make it sound
as if I'm forcing you.

63
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.144
At the moment. only I have
corp immunity for the Tanaka incident.

64
00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:32.563
<i>Slimy as ever.</i>

65
00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:36.317
Come on.
Let's play nice for old-time's sake.

66
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:39.654
Besides. aren't you thrilled
to take Arasaka money

67
00:04:39.737 --> 00:04:42.407
while fucking Militech with the same hand?

68
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.285
I'm certain Arasaka won't object.

69
00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:49.539
I'll personally negotiate
your commission and immunity.

70
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.544
<i>Never trust a soul in Night City.</i>

71
00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:58.214
<i>The fools
who make that mistake get burned.</i>

72
00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:03.261
<i>And David. a bargaining chip too?</i>

73
00:05:03.344 --> 00:05:07.807
<i>Naturally.
I've the perfect plan in mind.</i>

74
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.227
<i>And I'm confident
Arasaka will be onboard too.</i>

75
00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:18.026
<i>It's me.
And have I got a juicy job for you.</i>

76
00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:26.159
<i>Emergency meeting?
What gives. choomba?</i>

77
00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:29.412
<i>Faraday came through for us.</i>

78
00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:31.581
<i>Scored us our biggest gig yet.</i>

79
00:05:32.373 --> 00:05:35.001
Huge risk. huge reward.

80
00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:37.146
Tack out now if you do not
want to face that kind of heat.

81
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.088
Hm-mmm.

82
00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.094
- I'm counting on you too. Kiwi.
- Sure.

83
00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:49.098
Come on. Granny and Grampsy
are the bench this round.

84
00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.684
<i>Think your little chicken legs
will reach the pedals?</i>

85
00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:53.853
<i>Yo! Fair</i>

86
00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:55.480
<i>What's the plan?</i>

87
00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:58.566
<i>Security detail. Small but elite.</i>

88
00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:02.820
Faraday's brought in a decoy crew to split
'Saka's attention and manpower.

89
00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:05.323
Come on!

90
00:06:05.406 --> 00:06:06.532
<i>Decoys?</i>

91
00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:08.493
<i>Diversion aimed
to give us an opening.</i>

92
00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:11.370
<i>Though. I'm sure Faraday
didn't tell them that.</i>

93
00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:12.497
<i>Oh.</i>

94
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.832
<i>Classic Faraday shenanigans.</i>

95
00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:18.002
<i>Of course mother Anna's around
the bond too. Decoys for decoys.</i>

96
00:06:19.837 --> 00:06:21.380
You fucker!

97
00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:56.666
Yeah. Yeah.

98
00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:59.544
<i>Alright. Got 'em good
and split up.</i>

99
00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:00.627
<i>What do we do?</i>

100
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.048
<i>Target's gone off road.
We have a high ground.</i>

101
00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:05.842
Yo. Let's roll. Falco.

102
00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:08.678
- Yeehaw!
- Giddyup. partner!

103
00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:14.475
David! Engine's warm.
snacks are packed.

104
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.602
David!

105
00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:20.231
Wait. Are these... Are these
all immunoblockers?

106
00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:25.361
Help me out. will ya?
Grab my mom's jacket.

107
00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.447
I'm calling the gig off.

108
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.991
- We're going to Doc...
- Becca.

109
00:07:30.074 --> 00:07:31.325
I got a favor to ask.

110
00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:33.578
- You better knock it off.
- Becca.

111
00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:37.373
I can't ask
any-anyone but you.

112
00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:49.760
Rebecca?

113
00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:52.889
Puppy dog eyes? You know
I'm a sucker for 'em. didn't ya?

114
00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:55.600
Whatever. Just don't use
your fucking Sandevistan.

115
00:07:55.683 --> 00:07:57.643
- You hear me?
- Okay. okay.

116
00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:14.619
That's one down and gone!

117
00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:17.181
Alright.
we're tailgating the son of a bitch!

118
00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:18.807
I'll hack into its braking system.

119
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.431
Hold on. We got more on our ass.

120
00:08:24.128 --> 00:08:26.797
Too much. Can't get
a shot off on these guys.

121
00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:28.007
- Just leave it to me!
- Huh?

122
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.259
Don't even think about
using your Sandevistan.

123
00:08:38.392 --> 00:08:40.311
Escort van out of commish!

124
00:08:40.394 --> 00:08:42.355
Guess he's fucking deaf now.

125
00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:45.733
- Huh?
<i>- Come on. Punch the tube.</i>

126
00:08:45.816 --> 00:08:48.277
<i>Becca. cargo truck's exposed.
Plant the charge.</i>

127
00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:52.615
This is what
listening looks like.

128
00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:57.286
You fucking asshole!

129
00:09:02.833 --> 00:09:04.835
All appendixes in tact?

130
00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:07.296
Turn around. 'stache.
Eyes on the damn road.

131
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.506
- Hey. guys.
- Huh?

132
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.092
Not a scratch on that thing.

133
00:09:11.175 --> 00:09:13.344
ICE is just as thick.
Can't crack it.

134
00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:15.656
Then I'll fuckin'
hit 'em head-on if I got to.

135
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.764
Seriously. Quite showin'...

136
00:09:18.015 --> 00:09:21.143
You dick. Gettin' fucking tired
of being ignored.

137
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.273
<i>- Hey. no driver!</i>
- What's that?

138
00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:27.608
<i>This thing's on autopilot!</i>

139
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.698
<i>Perfect ambush. Perfect.
It's going perfectly.</i>

140
00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:37.451
<i>Exactly. Exactly as anticipated.
How I saw it.</i>

141
00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:39.704
<i>Very. very good work. Faraday.</i>

142
00:09:39.787 --> 00:09:42.540
<i>All projections green. On track.</i>

143
00:09:42.623 --> 00:09:45.167
<i>Tap's open.
Leaks out. Militech knows.</i>

144
00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:48.713
<i>Knows about the convoy.
You're getting your field test.</i>

145
00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:51.257
<i>Of course. assuming he</i>

146
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.468
<i>the boy. can wield the cyberskeleton.</i>

147
00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:56.887
<i>He'd better.
If he can't stomach it.</i>

148
00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:58.306
<i>gets cold feet.</i>

149
00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:01.851
<i>our recovery crew will face
a Militech battalion.</i>

150
00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:04.270
<i>A stalemate.
Bloody. bloody. That's our aim.</i>

151
00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:05.855
<i>No need to worry.</i>

152
00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:09.859
<i>My pawns are in place. yes.
my opening all set.</i>

153
00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:14.864
<i>So. please. please. sit back.
relax. enjoy the show.</i>

154
00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:20.286
<i>Not good. Better stop it quick.
Got a canyon up ahead.</i>

155
00:10:20.369 --> 00:10:22.288
- What?
<i>- David!</i>

156
00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:24.248
<i>Yeah. I hear you.</i>

157
00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:26.751
<i>Drop back.
Gig's fucking chalked.</i>

158
00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:33.674
So. What now. Martinez?

159
00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:37.511
You're right on the edge.

160
00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:41.140
- Falco! Pull up closer now!
- Easier said than done.

161
00:10:41.223 --> 00:10:43.434
<i>Hey! Launch the harpoon my way!</i>

162
00:10:43.517 --> 00:10:44.352
The hell?

163
00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:46.228
<i>And slam on the brakes on my sig!</i>

164
00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:48.123
<i>- What are you schemin' now?
- Come on! Come on!</i>

165
00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:50.608
What the fuck? He ain't right.

166
00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:52.151
I'll shoot it if you won't.

167
00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:04.121
Choom. you got this. It's time
to cut lose. No holding back.

168
00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:07.124
It's just you and the road.
No doubters to slow you down now.

169
00:11:07.708 --> 00:11:10.002
So. show 'em who you are.

170
00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:13.631
What you're made of.
You're special. remember?

171
00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.352
- Brake!
- Hit it!

172
00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:05.015
So nova!

173
00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:06.725
Well. that was fun.

174
00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:08.352
Bit my tongue off.

175
00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:19.363
VIP treatment.

176
00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:22.158
They send an executive-class AV

177
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:24.743
to collect one lone street girl.

178
00:12:24.827 --> 00:12:27.997
You really must be
their precious lost toy.

179
00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:35.296
No word? Lucy still quiet as a cricket?

180
00:12:35.379 --> 00:12:39.133
So what? How's another runner supposed to
help us out of this mess anyway.

181
00:12:39.216 --> 00:12:42.011
Gonna pay her from your cut. I hope!

182
00:12:42.094 --> 00:12:43.387
Kiwi. progress?

183
00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:46.307
Gonna need another
couple of minutes to breach the lock.

184
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.933
Didn't know about this.

185
00:12:48.017 --> 00:12:50.769
Don't sit right with me
the way the truck was unmanned

186
00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:52.897
We damn sure it's Arasaka?

187
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.100
If you're so worried.

188
00:12:54.148 --> 00:12:56.901
just grab the cargo and ghost. Hit it out.

189
00:12:56.984 --> 00:12:59.570
That's assuming you can pop it open quick.

190
00:12:59.653 --> 00:13:01.655
Your yapping is killing me literally.

191
00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:03.908
Can we please go get our wheels?

192
00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:08.996
You know. didn't really occur to me
when we first took the gig.

193
00:13:09.079 --> 00:13:10.789
but wide-open as it is out here.

194
00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:13.167
why. we'd be fishing the barrel
if someone got the jump.

195
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:14.168
Jesus. old man.

196
00:13:14.251 --> 00:13:17.213
nervous fart like you
doesn't deserve that cowboy 'stache.

197
00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:19.131
Acting like a little bitch.

198
00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:21.675
Bet you'd go weak in the knees
if I shaved it off.

199
00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:23.135
Ew! Gonna kick it off.

200
00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:27.431
Stop wrigging. I'm tryna get ya.

201
00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:28.515
Shit.

202
00:13:29.099 --> 00:13:31.685
Decoys didn't hold out long.
We got company. folks.

203
00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:44.156
A Basilisk?

204
00:13:44.865 --> 00:13:46.408
And a missile carrier!

205
00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:47.910
You're shitting me.

206
00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:48.993
Militech!

207
00:14:05.135 --> 00:14:06.512
What the fuck was that?

208
00:14:06.595 --> 00:14:09.056
Why are we getting steamrolled
by Militech?

209
00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:13.561
Faraday. That son-bitch
works for Militech. doesn't he?

210
00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:16.522
Now. if this don't smell fishy.
I don't know what does.

211
00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:20.651
All set. Open.

212
00:14:20.734 --> 00:14:22.069
What? Already?

213
00:14:22.152 --> 00:14:24.321
Want cover? Get inside. quick.

214
00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:26.991
What in seven hells?

215
00:14:27.074 --> 00:14:30.828
So. this is the thing that Faraday
had Maine looking all over for?

216
00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:33.289
Guess so. but anyone know
what the hell it is?

217
00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:36.834
A cyberskeleton. Military grade implant.

218
00:14:37.418 --> 00:14:41.171
Military.
Wait. So. like David's Sandevistan?

219
00:14:41.255 --> 00:14:44.466
Several degrees more advanced.
But yeah. sure.

220
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.634
Hey. now.

221
00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:48.596
That Sandevistan of his
is nothing to sneeze out either.

222
00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:51.015
Never ever
heard of tech like this.

223
00:14:51.098 --> 00:14:52.766
Believe me or don't.

224
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:53.976
Far as I know.

225
00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:58.355
Arasaka thinks they can overtake
Militech's market share in the arms trade.

226
00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:00.482
But this in mass production.

227
00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:04.695
They kept its development hush-hush.
Like. very.

228
00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:08.782
Most of the info they isolated
and concentrated under Tanaka.

229
00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:12.953
I'd say that's how Faraday
got his Militech contract to begin with.

230
00:15:13.037 --> 00:15:16.957
<i>Promised to snatch the prototype.
setting Arasaka back years.</i>

231
00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:22.129
It's not every day you see the splendor
of Night City at your feet.

232
00:15:22.212 --> 00:15:25.215
A welcome change of scenery
compared to ice baths

233
00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:28.385
and austere rooms. Shame not to share it.

234
00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:32.973
What do you say? Will you lend a hand?
Help me make your boy fly?

235
00:15:37.978 --> 00:15:39.772
- David.
- Lucy. She's calling.

236
00:15:39.855 --> 00:15:42.983
What! No. seriously.
not the time.

237
00:15:43.067 --> 00:15:43.984
<i>David!</i>

238
00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:45.903
Lucy! Where the hell have you...

239
00:15:45.986 --> 00:15:48.906
<i>- The cyberskeleton. Step into it.</i>
- Huh?

240
00:15:48.989 --> 00:15:51.617
<i>No time. Militech's incoming.</i>

241
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.370
<i>How could you know? Where are you?</i>

242
00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:56.622
<i>- They're after me. too.</i>
- Say what?

243
00:15:56.705 --> 00:15:59.041
<i>Do it now or everyone dies.</i>

244
00:16:01.752 --> 00:16:05.422
<i>Use the cyberskeleton
if you want to survive.</i>

245
00:16:06.048 --> 00:16:08.968
<i>Please. David. Before it's too late.</i>

246
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:12.012
<i>Lucy... I...</i>

247
00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:15.391
<i>David. I believe in you.</i>

248
00:16:17.226 --> 00:16:19.019
- Lucy!
- What'd she say?

249
00:16:19.103 --> 00:16:23.148
The cyberskeleton. Gotta use it
or we're all gonna die.

250
00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:24.233
Huh?

251
00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:26.795
- Lucy wouldn't say that though.
- You sure about that?

252
00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:28.737
Someone's after her. too.

253
00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:31.865
Got no choice. I'm gonna have to chip it.

254
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:34.743
This whole truck's
a mobile installation unit. Here.

255
00:16:35.703 --> 00:16:38.122
Deck's got the install sequence
primed and ready.

256
00:16:38.205 --> 00:16:40.541
No fucking way you're chipping
that fucking thing.

257
00:16:40.624 --> 00:16:42.060
Gotta get us out of this mess.

258
00:16:42.084 --> 00:16:42.960
Are you whacked?

259
00:16:43.043 --> 00:16:45.605
You don't even have the slightest idea
how the mystery chrome works

260
00:16:45.629 --> 00:16:46.709
or what it could do to you.

261
00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:49.550
Don't see any other options.
Do you?

262
00:16:49.633 --> 00:16:51.927
Besides me knocking you the fuck out?

263
00:16:52.594 --> 00:16:54.346
I'm gonna go grab our ride.

264
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.098
- I'll go with you.
- Good luck!

265
00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:59.268
Last time I went and installed something
that wasn't mine.

266
00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:01.061
Maine kicked the shit out of me.

267
00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:04.189
Didn't learn my lesson.

268
00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:07.526
Don't do it! Stop it. stop it.
stop it. stop it!

269
00:17:10.904 --> 00:17:14.450
You fucking gook! Told you not to!

270
00:17:21.957 --> 00:17:25.461
Militech's too quiet.
What are they plotting now?

271
00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:27.713
Hey. Kiwi. Did you...

272
00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:30.799
Sorry.

273
00:17:31.925 --> 00:17:34.720
<i>Made good on my end.
I'm outta here.</i>

274
00:17:34.803 --> 00:17:37.347
Excellent work. Militech's expecting you.

275
00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:38.891
You're free to pass.

276
00:17:38.974 --> 00:17:40.851
Meet me at the rendezvous point.

277
00:17:44.396 --> 00:17:45.556
How'd you...

278
00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:48.191
David?

279
00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:49.860
L-Lucy?

280
00:17:50.652 --> 00:17:53.739
David. cyberskeleton's a trap!
Don't install the soft.

281
00:17:53.822 --> 00:17:56.658
Lucy? What happened? Are you okay?

282
00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:59.244
<i>That was Faraday.
Not me. He set us up.</i>

283
00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:00.746
<i>Faraday?</i>

284
00:18:00.829 --> 00:18:03.540
He turned caller to Arasaka.

285
00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:05.744
They want you in their new toy.
Got you in that truck.

286
00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:08.629
<i>Me? But why?</i>

287
00:18:08.712 --> 00:18:11.048
He's using you.
pitting you against Militech.

288
00:18:11.131 --> 00:18:13.592
Then. a 'Saka squad's gonna grab you.

289
00:18:13.675 --> 00:18:17.054
And the suit. Get out of there.
Do not use it.

290
00:18:17.137 --> 00:18:18.889
Did you truly think

291
00:18:18.972 --> 00:18:20.933
we had no failsafe in place?

292
00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:25.979
<i>Lucy? What happened? Lucy?</i>

293
00:18:26.063 --> 00:18:29.858
<i>Militech. the prototype.
all they want. not-not you.</i>

294
00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:32.694
<i>Leave it. Go. Run.</i>

295
00:18:36.323 --> 00:18:38.075
<i>Lucy? Lucy?</i>

296
00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:42.579
Shall I open a second
neural port in the back of your skull?

297
00:18:42.663 --> 00:18:44.957
Lucy? Answer me!

298
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.085
<i>- I'm afraid she's currently indisposed.</i>
- Faraday?

299
00:18:48.168 --> 00:18:50.754
<i>I trust the job has been going well?</i>

300
00:18:50.838 --> 00:18:53.090
Fuck you. Put Lucy back on. Where is she?

301
00:18:53.715 --> 00:18:56.510
At the moment. your Arasaka runaway
is kissing the ground

302
00:18:56.593 --> 00:18:58.637
and should feel grateful for it.

303
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.265
I was worried
I might've overscrambled her brain

304
00:19:01.348 --> 00:19:03.183
before delivering her back home.

305
00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:05.435
Take your fucking foot off her right now!

306
00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:09.398
<i>Don't be so serious.
I'm just having a ball of a time.</i>

307
00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:11.483
<i>Besides. I won't have to lift a finger</i>

308
00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:13.169
<i>when Arasaka's done with her.</i>

309
00:19:13.193 --> 00:19:14.945
Faraday!

310
00:19:15.946 --> 00:19:18.240
You're degenerating rapidly!

311
00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:21.201
At this rate. you're gonna go psycho
any second!

312
00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:25.581
<i>Elite Militech forces are closing in
on your position as we speak.</i>

313
00:19:25.664 --> 00:19:28.917
<i>Install the soft.
Use the cyberskeleton. David.</i>

314
00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:30.210
<i>Lead your crew to safety.</i>

315
00:19:30.294 --> 00:19:33.255
<i>If you ask me. I think it's beyond you.</i>

316
00:19:33.338 --> 00:19:36.216
<i>Clearly. Arasaka sees something I don't.</i>

317
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.051
<i>If you're truly as special</i>

318
00:19:38.135 --> 00:19:39.803
<i>as they say you are. boy.</i>

319
00:19:39.887 --> 00:19:42.764
<i>show me what you're capable of. Survive.</i>

320
00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:45.225
I'm gonna rip out his spine!

321
00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:47.728
I'll kill him! I'll kill him.

322
00:19:47.811 --> 00:19:49.354
You're dead.

323
00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:51.607
Dead. Dead.

324
00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:53.358
Fucking dead!

325
00:19:53.942 --> 00:19:55.986
I'll fucking kill you!

326
00:19:59.072 --> 00:20:00.449
Back to normal?

327
00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:02.242
Lucy. Gonna go save her.

328
00:20:02.326 --> 00:20:05.495
No. guess not. Sounds like
your brain's fried.

329
00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:07.789
Faraday's double-crossed the crew.

330
00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:09.416
He's got Lucy with him now.

331
00:20:09.499 --> 00:20:11.293
Lucy? What do you mean?

332
00:20:11.376 --> 00:20:14.213
That motherfucker.
I'm gonna put him in the ground.

333
00:20:14.296 --> 00:20:16.715
Tear his fucking guts out
and shove 'em down his throat!

334
00:20:16.798 --> 00:20:17.798
Oh no.

335
00:20:19.134 --> 00:20:21.345
Falco! What happened?

336
00:20:21.428 --> 00:20:22.930
Kiwi happened.

337
00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:26.183
- Huh?
- She led us right into this trap.

338
00:20:26.266 --> 00:20:28.810
<i>That old hag's
mixed up in this too?</i>

339
00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:31.563
<i>She's a fucking flatline
when I see her next.</i>

340
00:20:37.819 --> 00:20:39.404
Dammit! Here we go again!

341
00:20:41.698 --> 00:20:45.327
Shit. shit. shit!
Militech needs to fucking chil!

342
00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:48.997
Never seen anything
this high-spec in my life.

343
00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:51.208
How do you even move around
in that thing?

344
00:20:51.291 --> 00:20:53.752
<i>Comes with
two compact AV thrusters built in.</i>

345
00:20:53.835 --> 00:20:56.129
<i>Same kind you get on an AV.</i>

346
00:20:56.213 --> 00:21:00.467
<i>On top of that. Arasaka engineered
in a gravity modification prototype.</i>

347
00:21:04.179 --> 00:21:08.350
<i>It can generate unidirectional
grav fields. magnetic forces. too.</i>

348
00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:11.103
That there the mag field generator?

349
00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.858
Holy hell!

350
00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:19.069
That's a whole squad he just mowed down.

351
00:21:19.152 --> 00:21:22.447
Oh. geez. He's using his Sandy. too.

352
00:21:37.754 --> 00:21:42.092
Huh?

353
00:21:44.886 --> 00:21:46.054
He's flying!

354
00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:47.806
Is that thing the grav field?

355
00:21:54.688 --> 00:21:56.528
<i>Shown to be inconsistent
in field tests.</i>

356
00:21:57.524 --> 00:21:58.650
<i>Those who are wielding it.</i>

357
00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:01.028
<i>can't withstand the strain
on their nervous system.</i>

358
00:22:02.946 --> 00:22:07.826
<i>It requires someone with an abnormally
high tolerance for cyberware integration.</i>

359
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:10.620
<i>Sure fire way to go
cyberpsycho. you mean.</i>

360
00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:23.884
No. They got our boy?

361
00:22:24.468 --> 00:22:25.886
<i>David.</i>

362
00:22:34.352 --> 00:22:35.645
Kid's still going.

363
00:22:36.229 --> 00:22:38.023
Yeah. his body is. but...

364
00:22:38.106 --> 00:22:39.566
<i>The longer one uses it.</i>

365
00:22:39.649 --> 00:22:43.570
<i>the higher the risk of bodily
cyberware capacity overload.</i>

366
00:22:43.653 --> 00:22:45.113
<i>But being said.</i>

367
00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:48.033
<i>the power it generates in the short-term...</i>

368
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:55.540
<i>...is unlike anything
on this side of sanity.</i>

369
00:23:05.092 --> 00:23:06.259
David?

370
00:23:12.808 --> 00:23:15.477
<i>Faraday's gonna regret
playing us like dogs.</i>

371
00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.854
<i>And we're getting Lucy out of there.</i>

372
00:23:17.938 --> 00:23:19.106
But David...

373
00:23:19.189 --> 00:23:21.108
Maine said everyone gets a fair shake.

374
00:23:22.317 --> 00:23:24.486
That's the only way I operate too.

375
00:23:27.155 --> 00:23:28.865
Sign me up. choomba.

376
00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:31.576
