The Basilisk is down!

9
00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:45.647
That was one guy. How?

10
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.291
The dick just sold us bad intel!

11
00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:49.734
- So many dead.
- Call for back-up!

12
00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:51.152
He's on the move!

13
00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:52.880
He's heading straight
for Night City.

14
00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:56.491
Cyberskeleton!
Can't allow Saka to recover it!

15
00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:59.494
Well? Where now?

16
00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:00.495
Arasaka!

17
00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:03.498
- HQ? City Center?
- That's right!

18
00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:05.542
What the hell for?

19
00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.293
We're saving Lucy!

20
00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:09.712
Why is she at Saka HQ?

21
00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:12.632
Faraday.
Rat bastard cut a deal with her.

22
00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:17.262
Just gotta rest my eyes a sec.

23
00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:19.305
For real? Jesus!

24
00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.724
The meds are starting to wear off
faster and faster...

25
00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.228
Hey. folks.
Militech's multiplying.

26
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:28.231
Shit! Shake 'em off.
David's gotta take five.

27
00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.233
- What?! Right now?
- Yup.

28
00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:32.110
Okay. All right!

29
00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:34.487
If he needs five. I'll buy him five!

30
00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:39.784
Hold them on front. 'kay?

31
00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:42.495
Yes. ma'am! You leave 'em to me!

32
00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.725
Way to go. old man!

33
00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:07.186
Yahoo!

34
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.271
Yeah!

35
00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:12.191
Shit. another swarm ahead!

36
00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:13.568
Arasaka this time!

37
00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:16.362
Okie-dokie! Barrel on through!

38
00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:19.365
You know. this swarm looks pretty mad.
Better pull off.

39
00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.200
Huh? Yo. come on!

40
00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:23.703
Militech's forces
are nearly wiped out.

41
00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:28.416
The test subject is already in the city
and our recovery team is in position.

42
00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:31.127
But this will be hell for us to cover up.

43
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.715
This is exactly what we deserved
for trusting a fixer with our investment.

44
00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:37.550
Based on his current trajectory.

45
00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:41.638
we estimate a 74 percent chance
that this is his destination.

46
00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.723
Here? But why?

47
00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:45.225
We're not sure.

48
00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:48.645
He should have no knowledge
of our direct involvement.

49
00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.564
Well. fuck. Contact security.

50
00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:54.442
Ma'am? That would alert
the higher-ups.

51
00:03:54.525 --> 00:03:57.862
We stir up a storm
and hide in the dust.

52
00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:01.115
Christ. Faraday... so much for perfection.

53
00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:03.034
Imagine that.

54
00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:05.662
Arasaka counter intel
extending an invitation

55
00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:08.122
to a lowly fixer like me.

56
00:04:08.706 --> 00:04:11.876
Quite the promotion. wouldn't you say?
Unheard off. really.

57
00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:17.548
Yet. even this leap. I consider only
a single step in my ascend.

58
00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:20.343
Night City does not reward complacency.

59
00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.137
<i>Faraday.</i>

60
00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.223
<i>Kiwi. What's the hold up?</i>

61
00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:29.227
David donned
the cyberskeleton as planned.

62
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.896
but didn't wipe out Militech.
Not completely.

63
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.314
<i>Go on.</i>

64
00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:34.625
Didn't think it possible.

65
00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:37.318
but he's dippin' in and out
of cyberpsychosis...

66
00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:38.653
gliding along the edge.

67
00:04:38.736 --> 00:04:42.699
<i>If David comes through without goin' full.
he's gunnin' for us next.</i>

68
00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:43.866
<i>I know it.</i>

69
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.161
<i>He's clearly resilient.
for a chrome junkie.</i>

70
00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:51.082
<i>But it's nothing Arasaka's recovery team
can't clean up. I'm sure.</i>

71
00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:53.209
Maybe. But I'm not about to chance it.

72
00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.295
Did my part. so I'm skippin' town.

73
00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:58.923
Zip me my eds. and we're done.

74
00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:02.343
<i>Not quite. I'm en route to deliver
the runner girl to Arasaka.</i>

75
00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:04.971
<i>I'll need you as backup.
Meet me at the drop point.</i>

76
00:05:05.054 --> 00:05:06.306
<i>You'll get your cut then.</i>

77
00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.017
<i>Besides. I'd hoped to see you
one last time.</i>

78
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.185
<i>We owe ourselves that much.</i>

79
00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:13.062
<i>How sweet of you.</i>

80
00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:16.691

90
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:02.862

91
00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:04.530
Wakey-wakey. David!

92
00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:07.825
These immuno-blockers
are military-issued.

93
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.536
Nine times your customary dosage.

94
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.873
They should keep you
on the right side of crazy.

95
00:06:13.956 --> 00:06:17.418
But they only delay the effects.
not erase 'em.

96
00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:20.671
By the time you hit the last vial.
understand these.

97
00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:23.174
Whatever's still left of you. they will...

98
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:25.551
will slingshot the other way...

99
00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:29.639
<i>and fly straight over the edge.</i>

100
00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:00.128
Goddamnit. They just keep comin'!

101
00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:02.088
Huh?

102
00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.437
That's the shit!

103
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.230
Huh?

104
00:07:35.496 --> 00:07:37.832
<i>You have to work hard
and rise through the ranks.</i>

105
00:07:37.915 --> 00:07:41.627
<i>My son at Arasaka Tower top floor!
I can just see it.</i>

106
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.006
You've got this. D.
You're the smartest person I know.

107
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.262
You're right. Mom.

108
00:07:51.345 --> 00:07:54.015
I know I can. I'll do my best.

109
00:07:54.098 --> 00:07:57.852
You got my word.
Arasaka. all the way to the top.

110
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.938
All right. David.

111
00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:03.274
Let's go. To the top. then.

112
00:08:03.357 --> 00:08:06.819
I got these special meds from Doc.

113
00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:10.615
If I start losing it.
I need you to shoot me up

114
00:08:10.698 --> 00:08:12.158
so I can keep it together.

115
00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:18.915
David's meds. I don't think
they're gonna work anymore.

116
00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:20.750
Yeah? So what's the plan?

117
00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:24.545
Nothing's changed.
We knock on Saka's door.

118
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:26.422
With David in that kind of shape?

119
00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:28.132
Gotta get him to Lucy.

120
00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:29.759
Lucy?

121
00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:33.262
She's the only one
who can maybe bring him back.

122
00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:35.306
There's no one else!

123
00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:45.024
I'm not doing
any more work for you.

124
00:08:45.107 --> 00:08:46.107
Is that so?

125
00:08:46.734 --> 00:08:47.652
Such a shame.

126
00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:53.324
My contract stipulates that

127
00:08:53.407 --> 00:08:56.619
...I get rid of anyone
who knows about the cyberskeleton.

128
00:08:57.161 --> 00:09:00.831
No special exceptions. Even you.

129
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.710
Go! After her!

130
00:09:05.586 --> 00:09:08.589
Comin' up on the Tower!
The hell do we do now?

131
00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:10.967
Don't ask me. I don't fucking know!

132
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:14.095
David! Do the gravity thing!

133
00:09:16.013 --> 00:09:18.224
Woo-hoo!

134
00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:23.104
Da-da-da-die. you corpo sickhead!

135
00:09:28.484 --> 00:09:30.027
Bastards!

136
00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:32.321
- Cut us a goddamn break!
- Come on!

137
00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:39.453
- Did we lose 'em?
- Most. I think!

138
00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:41.455
No! MaxTac!

139
00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:46.085
Three AVs?

140
00:09:46.168 --> 00:09:48.921
Shit! They already tagged him as a psycho?

141
00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:53.384
We're in a tight spot. We're only fucked
if David doesn't get his shit together!

142
00:09:53.467 --> 00:09:55.386
Ugh. you don't say!

143
00:09:55.469 --> 00:09:58.097
MaxTac has been dispatched.

144
00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.767
He said the authorities are treating this
as a cyberpsycho incident.

145
00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:03.394
What a mess.

146
00:10:03.477 --> 00:10:06.397
This has escalated
far beyond our field test.

147
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.857
That damn boy.

148
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.360
We need to stop him
before he makes matters even worse.

149
00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:13.779
I'm afraid that's impossible
at this stage.

150
00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:16.741
He has to burn out on his own.
No one can stop him now.

151
00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:19.493
I can think
of one individual who can.

152
00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:20.911
Who might that be?

153
00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:22.913
Adam Smasher.

154
00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:24.332
You're serious?

155
00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:28.294
Utterly. Extreme situations
require extreme solutions.

156
00:10:28.377 --> 00:10:30.546
But still...
The time it would take him to...

157
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.757
Not a problem.

158
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.508
He's here already.

159
00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:39.221
Pending our field test. the cyberskeleton
was originally designated for him.

160
00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:43.517
So if he can't use his new toy.
how fitting for him to destroy it?

161
00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:44.644
Time to get gone.

162
00:10:44.727 --> 00:10:46.020
Just drop put. why don't ya?

163
00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.707
<i>What. are you afraid
of getting caught?</i>

164
00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:50.816
<i>Coz I know I sure is shit ain't.</i>

165
00:10:57.114 --> 00:10:59.825
MaxTac freaks. come and get us!
Just fucking try!

166
00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:05.289
What the hell? Hey! Shit!

167
00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:07.291
No way! You're just gonna leave us here?

168
00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:09.543
Momma! Mom!

169
00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:20.679
That a man or a merc?

170
00:11:20.763 --> 00:11:21.972
Just keep shooting!

171
00:11:22.056 --> 00:11:24.683
Wait! Araska is handling the rest.

172
00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:26.352
Code AS. Pull it out.

173
00:11:26.435 --> 00:11:27.853
What?

174
00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.859
Becca... How many vials have we got left?

175
00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:35.361
Down to one last one.

176
00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.614
Guess my clock's finally running out...

177
00:11:39.448 --> 00:11:41.867
<i>- Falco.</i>
- Kiwi?

178
00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:44.870
Huh? That two-timing bitch!
I'll fucking kill her!

179
00:11:45.496 --> 00:11:47.790
Huh? What am I looking at here?

180
00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:49.375
<i>Falco. listen.</i>

181
00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:53.462
Faraday. he. well... My time's ticking down.

182
00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:55.881
<i>Got you too. did he?</i>

183
00:11:56.465 --> 00:11:58.342
<i>Yup.</i>

184
00:11:58.426 --> 00:12:01.762
<i>I did tag his AV. though.</i>
Sending you coords.

185
00:12:02.304 --> 00:12:05.015
<i>Follow 'em. you'll find the bastard.</i>

186
00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:07.351
<i>Really expect us to trust you?</i>

187
00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:08.644
<i>I know. I know.</i>

188
00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:12.148
Oh. Kiwi. look at you.

189
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.151
It just hasn't been your day.

190
00:12:15.776 --> 00:12:18.904
And Lucy?
She with Faraday right now?

191
00:12:21.323 --> 00:12:23.534
Mhh. you want that corphugger dead.
blood for blood.

192
00:12:23.617 --> 00:12:26.245
<i>Nah. it's not like that...</i>

193
00:12:26.328 --> 00:12:30.583
Taught Lucy never to trust a soul
in this city.

194
00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:34.545
Everyone turns on you.
some point or other...

195
00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:40.301
Just figure Faraday's
long overdue to an important lesson.

196
00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:43.804
Go get 'er for me.

197
00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:53.814
Kiwi is a flatline. bossman.

198
00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:55.566
Nasty business...

199
00:13:04.992 --> 00:13:06.035
Hey!

200
00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:11.457
That can't be David!

201
00:13:21.717 --> 00:13:23.636
Don't stop 'til we reach the loading dock!

202
00:13:24.553 --> 00:13:27.932
Faraday will be arriving
shortly to deliver the netrunner.

203
00:13:28.015 --> 00:13:31.936
As I thought.
Martinez is after our fixer. not us.

204
00:13:32.019 --> 00:13:34.063
I'll order the pilot to turn around.

205
00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:35.356
No.

206
00:13:35.439 --> 00:13:39.401
keep them on course for the dock.
You'll meet them there.

207
00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:41.904
I will meet them there

208
00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:43.405
You must have realized by now

209
00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:47.493
that someone would have to take the fall
for this colossal clusterfuck.

210
00:13:47.576 --> 00:13:49.954
and surely you knew it wouldn't be me.

211
00:13:50.037 --> 00:13:51.747
Still confused?

212
00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.626
Make sure that mangy fixer
never makes it past the loading dock.

213
00:13:55.709 --> 00:13:57.294
Not a single step.

214
00:14:00.381 --> 00:14:02.675
You're up against the cyberskeleton.

215
00:14:02.758 --> 00:14:05.803
Expect you'll have some fun. aye. Smasher?

216
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.097
It's a child's toy

217
00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.475
reliant on antigrav training wheels.

218
00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:13.686
Not even worth my time.

219
00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:20.067
Kill him. you fools!

220
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.569
Fire at will!

221
00:14:21.652 --> 00:14:22.987
Where is he?

222
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:24.321
No one's there!

223
00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:29.785
<i>Look. Mom...</i>

224
00:14:30.452 --> 00:14:33.747
I'm here. very top of Arasaka Tower.

225
00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:39.795
All right. One last vial left. Hey. Doc...

226
00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:43.591
Once you go screaming over the edge.
it's all over.

227
00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:46.552
Ain't no fucking coming back.

228
00:14:46.635 --> 00:14:48.804
Doesn't matter if you're special or not.

229
00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:51.306
<i>You were right.</i>

230
00:14:52.474 --> 00:14:55.769
But there's no other way... Not for me.

231
00:15:01.483 --> 00:15:05.487
Faraday. it seems someone
didn't follow the plan.

232
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:08.157
I brought the runner girl. didn't I?

233
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.492
Alive. and worth
the full million as agreed.

234
00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:13.746
You were given a leash
and chose to stray from it.

235
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:17.750
Do you what happens to dogs
who have a habit of misbehaving?

236
00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:19.418
Is that a threat?

237
00:15:19.501 --> 00:15:22.755
The data you seek is still in my hands.

238
00:15:22.838 --> 00:15:25.966
You will not step one foot
inside the facility.

239
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:27.509
This is non-negotiable.

240
00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:30.262
That would be very unwise of you.

241
00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:32.598
With the information I have
at my disposal.

242
00:15:32.681 --> 00:15:36.018
you must surely see you cannot afford
to keep me off your payroll.

243
00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:38.604
Leave the girl and remove yourself now.

244
00:15:38.687 --> 00:15:40.397
We'll send your payment as agreed.

245
00:15:40.481 --> 00:15:42.149
But we have no further use for you

246
00:15:42.232 --> 00:15:45.069
if you're unable to provide data
on the cyberskeleton.

247
00:15:45.152 --> 00:15:47.404
In this. you have failed your assignment.

248
00:15:54.828 --> 00:15:56.288
Lucy...

249
00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:57.414
David...

250
00:16:21.146 --> 00:16:22.231
You see?

251
00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:25.109
The cyberskeleton returned to you
as promised...

252
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:32.866
Oh no. you don't.

253
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.827
You ain't flatlining just yet.

254
00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:39.081
Adam Smasher. hurry!

255
00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:40.666
Go on. kill the boy!

256
00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:42.084
Who the fuck are you?

257
00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:44.586
You fuckin' merc! Do your job!

258
00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:48.007
My business is with the kid.

259
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.967
That's Adam Smasher?

260
00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:52.803
So this is Adam Smasher in the chrome?

261
00:16:52.886 --> 00:16:54.722
NC boogeyman of legend.

262
00:16:55.472 --> 00:16:59.935
You're packing some pretty heavy artillery
for your size. boy.

263
00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:03.480
I'm surprised you could string
two words together.

264
00:17:03.564 --> 00:17:05.315
Likewise. choom.

265
00:17:05.399 --> 00:17:07.192
Heard you went no-ganic full-borg.

266
00:17:07.276 --> 00:17:10.237
so I gotta ask. Any brain left
in that chrome dome of yours?

267
00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:13.073
You could say I'm special.

268
00:17:13.157 --> 00:17:14.908
Well. so the fuck am I!

269
00:17:14.992 --> 00:17:16.493
That a joke?

270
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:20.122

- You installed it.
- Yeah.

290
00:18:32.986 --> 00:18:35.405
Course. you did...

291
00:18:36.698 --> 00:18:38.992

My mom. Maine. and the others in our crew.

I couldn't let that happen.
Not to you. too.

But you never had to save me.

You have a Sandevistan?

328
00:20:54.878 --> 00:20:56.922
A rudimentary implant.

329
00:20:57.005 --> 00:20:59.466
I'm the one you're after. ain't I?

330
00:20:59.549 --> 00:21:01.426
All the same meat to me.

331
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.679
I'll slaughter each and every one of you.

332
00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:05.931
Not unless I zero your ass first!

333
00:21:09.893 --> 00:21:12.062
Out of suppressants?

334
00:21:14.398 --> 00:21:17.192
Right on schedule.

335
00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:18.318
No. you don't!

336
00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:27.536
How did you?

337
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:34.376
Falco... David's still back there... please.

338
00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:35.502
Turn around!

339
00:21:35.585 --> 00:21:39.631
None leave the slaughterhouse! Not alive!

340
00:21:40.215 --> 00:21:42.134
Get distracted much?

341
00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:43.885
You...

342
00:21:44.469 --> 00:21:46.263
Who are you...

343
00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:49.016
to challenge me?

344
00:21:49.641 --> 00:21:54.354
You can't even stand
without your antigrav crutches.

345
00:21:54.438 --> 00:21:57.774
You think you're special
coz you're strappy?

346
00:22:00.277 --> 00:22:02.738
Don't make me laugh!

347
00:22:06.074 --> 00:22:08.910
- Falco! Turn back!
- No can do.

348
00:22:09.619 --> 00:22:11.538
It was David's final request.

349
00:22:11.621 --> 00:22:13.832
If I turn around now...

350
00:22:13.915 --> 00:22:15.292
he dies for nothing.

351
00:22:15.876 --> 00:22:18.503
We already have our reward money.
