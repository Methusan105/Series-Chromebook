There is much I know about you.

209

Despite that.

212
00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:11.128
I was the one who insisted
that you be readmitted at once.

213
00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:12.380
[David] You did?

214
00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:16.884
Please. David.
You can help to stop all of this.

215
00:11:16.967 --> 00:11:19.720
I'm begging you. I do not wish to die.

You think Arasaka won't hunt them down?

220
00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:35.069
Just think. Why would I revoke
your expulsion after what happened?

221
00:11:35.152 --> 00:11:38.364
You have demonstrated unique potential.

222
00:11:38.447 --> 00:11:41.617
Arasaka sees in you a valuable asset.
