﻿1
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.851
Director Evans.

2
00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:20.854
What... What the hell? How long
have you been standing there?

3
00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:24.566
My apologies. sir.
I did knock a few times.

4
00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:27.485
It's alright. Tell me what it is you need.

5
00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:32.407
It's getting late.
May I go home for the day?

6
00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:35.160
My apologies.

7
00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:37.495
I ask ony because I have plans
for the evening.

8
00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.332
Shall I adjust all our deadlines
to accommodate your personal schedule?

9
00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:44.252
No. sir. It's just...

10
00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:47.922
My son got into the Academy.
I... I wanted to surprise him.

11
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.383
Delightful. Another legacy hire.

12
00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.969
Please extend my congratulations.

13
00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:56.890
Find someone to fetch the UG2 sample
and you are free to go.

14
00:00:56.973 --> 00:01:00.268
But at this hour. they've all gone home.

15
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.732
It's no problem. sir.
I'll grab the sample myself.

16
00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:07.942
How very kind of you.

17
00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:11.237
Fetch it and then get out of my sight.

18
00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:24.501
Uh... Director Evans. I. uh...

19
00:01:33.968 --> 00:01:35.011
But why?

20
00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:39.766
Hm?

21
00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.896
What happened in there?

22
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.234
Lost you for a sec.
Someone raise a jammer?

23
00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:51.486
Hm. Connection was stable throughout.

24
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.196
Weird.

25
00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:57.784
Man. oh. man.
That gig was a snore.

26
00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:16.886
<i>♪ Eyes. burning a way through me ♪</i>

27
00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:22.976
<i>♪ Eyes. destroying so sweetly ♪</i>

28
00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:29.357
<i>♪ Now. there is a fire in me ♪</i>

29
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:35.738
<i>♪ A fire that burns ♪</i>

30
00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:06.352
<i>♪ This fire is out of control ♪</i>

31
00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:09.939
<i>♪ I'll burn it. I'll burn it
I'll burn it. I'll burn it down ♪</i>

32
00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:24.078
<i>♪ I'll burn it. I'll burn it
I'll burn it. I'll burn it down ♪</i>

33
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.422
They trespassed
on Arasaka premises.

34
00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:36.674
Hit us in our own fucking facility.

35
00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:40.511
The lab's research is focused
on Militech countermeasures.

36
00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:44.140
The runner who killed Jamie
and Marcus. you think it's related?

37
00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.059
Evans's head was blown off.

38
00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:49.020
This was sloppy. violent. guns blazing.

39
00:03:49.103 --> 00:03:51.439
Safe to say. not the same runner.

40
00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:55.693
Finding the netrunner remains
our priority. Too dangerous. that one.

41
00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:58.196
We know neither
their motive nor intentions.

42
00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.323
Whoever they are. they're careful.

43
00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:03.493
Not your average rogue runner
looking to make a name.

44
00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:05.411
We're Arasaka Counterintel.

45
00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:07.205
We never deal with average.

46
00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:10.333
We'll need to take a detour
to get on the netrunner's trail.

47
00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:12.627
Are we pursuing
Director Evans' killer?

48
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.504
A different trail. most likely.

49
00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.965
But maybe we'll get lucky
and see them merge.

50
00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:21.552
Let's switch it up.
See if the fixer angle bears fruit.

51
00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:25.265
We'll need one of Militech's mutts.
Who do we know that's on their payroll?

52
00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:29.394
Checking it now. What if this fixer
has ties to our runner?

53
00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:33.022
What's to stop them from selling
information on the product to Militech?

54
00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.983
Higher-ups want it kept secret.

55
00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:38.278
All NC fixers are self-serving scoutbags.

56
00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.697
They just need a push
in the right direction.

57
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.826
In the end. they're only glorified
corporate lapdogs existing to serve.

58
00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.495
We'll remind them
who their real masters are.

59
00:04:47.578 --> 00:04:50.748
They must be warned of what happens
when they bite the hand that feeds.

60
00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.001
And just how will we do this?

61
00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:57.880
We tell them
in the only language this city speaks.

62
00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:02.134
Hmm?

63
00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:08.891
Look out!

64
00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:43.176
I was very nearly killed.

65
00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.179
But Arasaka? How can you be sure?

66
00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:48.639
You taking me for a fool?
Who else?

67
00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:52.018
Even so. don't expect
a bump in hazard pay.

68
00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:54.479
And corporate immunity
is still off the table.

69
00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:55.563
What a joke!

70
00:05:55.646 --> 00:05:59.400
Listen. your fuckup with Tanaka
already has this operation in the red.

71
00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:01.569
With nothing to show for it.

72
00:06:01.652 --> 00:06:04.322
We expect returns on our investments.

73
00:06:04.405 --> 00:06:07.158
Want more resources. show us results.

74
00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:10.286
And what the hell do you think
I've been so busy chasing?

75
00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:12.413
Check your tone. Faraday.

76
00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:15.666
You're running out of time.
Our patience is running thin.

77
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.295
You're aware that Arasaka's security
has been very tight.

78
00:06:19.378 --> 00:06:21.089
They clearly view the cyberskeleton

79
00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:24.092
as a market game-changer
worthy of their utmost vigilance.

80
00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:25.218
You ask too much.

81
00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:28.012
Don't lecture me. I know the stakes.

82
00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:30.681
We know its worth. We know yours.

83
00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:34.310
Not another eddie until you earn it.
We're done here.

84
00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:41.776
Cocky self-important brat.

85
00:06:51.702 --> 00:06:54.747
Fixer's made contact. As we foresaw.

86
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.457
There's a good boy.

87
00:06:57.041 --> 00:06:59.085
What a mischievous little dog.

88
00:07:03.172 --> 00:07:05.591
<i>...tonight. so keep those optics tuned in.</i>

89
00:07:06.175 --> 00:07:07.455
<i>First up is a top of the line...</i>

90
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.636
David?

91
00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:10.596
Huh?

92
00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:13.015
Oh. sorry. my bad.

93
00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:14.976
Did I wake you?

94
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.019
Can't sleep?

95
00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.021
Couldn't shut my brain down.

96
00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:21.107
- Oh.
- I'll turn it off.

97
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.733
Aren't you watching?

98
00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:24.235
No. I just kinda zoning out.

99
00:07:24.318 --> 00:07:26.320
<i>- Enemies outnumber...</i>
- Huh?

100
00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:30.283
Only 250K to the Moon?

101
00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:31.367
Cheaper than I thought.

102
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.786
Only for a one-way ticket though.

103
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.663
Yeah. true.

104
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:37.874
You remembered.

105
00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:39.167
Huh?

106
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.252
Hmm. I need to sleep.

107
00:07:42.086 --> 00:07:43.629
Okay. Goodnight. then.

108
00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:47.133
<i>...eurodollars. Get your one-way ticket now.</i>

109
00:07:47.216 --> 00:07:50.761
<i>Pick up one new case...</i>

110
00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:53.181
Rundown diner meetup

111
00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:56.017
with the counter-intel
of the world's greatest megacorp.

112
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.854
I thought you'd find
the familiarity reassuring.

113
00:07:59.937 --> 00:08:02.273
Depends wholly on your answer.

114
00:08:02.356 --> 00:08:05.485
The cyberskeleton project
is a delicate topic.

115
00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:07.403
even within Arasaka.

116
00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:08.571
It turned problematic

117
00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:12.033
when Tanaka over-consolidated
the operational data.

118
00:08:12.116 --> 00:08:14.619
How much does Militech already know?

119
00:08:14.702 --> 00:08:17.246
Information is the lifeblood of my trade.

120
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.915
So. I do not share it freely.

121
00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:20.333
We respect that

122
00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:23.461
and understand
you're the best fixer for the job.

123
00:08:23.544 --> 00:08:27.840
We'll gladly provide the compensation
Militech foolishly denied you.

124
00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:30.927
As for the Tanaka mess.
consider your debt settled.

125
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.178
Now. I'm listening.

126
00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:35.556
But of course. I would
need to add a few conditions.

127
00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:37.433
Go on.

128
00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:38.935
We must eliminate

129
00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:42.897
any and all persons aware
of the cyberskeleton's existence.

130
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:43.981
Done.

131
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.443
- And one more thing.
- Yes?

132
00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:48.986
A meddlesome netrunner.

133
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.239
Since Tanaka's death.
they have been interfering

134
00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:54.617
with our data recovery efforts
regarding the cyberskeleton.

135
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.078
Do you have information on who it may be?

136
00:08:57.828 --> 00:09:00.206
- Afraid not.
- Unfortunate.

137
00:09:00.289 --> 00:09:02.959
We find this case especially curious.

138
00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:05.044
Even if Militech were behind it.

139
00:09:05.127 --> 00:09:08.297
we can't conceive of a reasonable motive.

140
00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:10.883
From what my sources tell me.

141
00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:13.302
not a single soul knows of Tanaka's ties

142
00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:15.304
to the cyberskeleton project.

143
00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.682
- An inside job?
- Impossible.

144
00:09:17.765 --> 00:09:21.727
No one in the Arasaka subnet moves
internally without leaving breadcrumbs.

145
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.646
No. Our theory points outward.

146
00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:27.358
Those skills are bounty's most likely
not corporate. an edgerunner.

147
00:09:27.441 --> 00:09:31.112
A perfect job for a fixer.
wouldn't you agree?

148
00:09:31.195 --> 00:09:32.863
Is this an official contract?

149
00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:36.367
A cool million for bringing in
the runner alive.

150
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.369
Half of that for just their head.

151
00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:41.247
We have a deal.

152
00:09:42.164 --> 00:09:45.501
<i>Whoa. Rare call. Butt dial?
Even possible on this?</i>

153
00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:47.336
<i>Kiwi. hey.</i>

154
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.713
<i>What's up-up?</i>

155
00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:49.797
<i>No. nothing.</i>

156
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.801
<i>- Just-just a question I need to ask.
- A question?</i>

157
00:09:53.884 --> 00:09:56.596
<i>Not like. you know. No big deal.</i>

158
00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:58.931
<i>Like-like how David's...</i>

159
00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:02.018
<i>David? Fine. he's fine. For a punk.</i>

160
00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:03.769
<i>Thought he'd need hand-holding. help.</i>

161
00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:07.607
<i>but stepped up big. Big leader. Weird.</i>

162
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.610
<i>And Faraday. we're back on his payroll.</i>

163
00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:11.527
<i>Heard. yeah.</i>

164
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:15.698
<i>Maine'd snap a circ.
zippf. if he saw David.</i>

165
00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:16.824
<i>Hmm.</i>

166
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.536
<i>Some-something on your mind. Luce?</i>

167
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.290
<i>Hmm? No. no. Like. happy
to hear he's holding up. 's all.</i>

168
00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:26.226
<i>Why call? Why? Come see him. Just...</i>

169
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.418
<i>Huh?</i>

170
00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:31.714
<i>He's moping. waitin'. always is.
You. Wants you.</i>

171
00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:35.009
<i>Wants you back ASAP. So-so-so obvious.</i>

172
00:10:35.092 --> 00:10:37.803
<i>- Yeah. I know.
- Still a no-no no-go?</i>

173
00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:40.139

You wanna take a walk?

203
00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:33.377

What was what?

210
00:12:46.557 --> 00:12:48.642
You know exactly what I mean.

<i>Don't walk.</i>

215
00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:56.483
I'm fine.

220
00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:11.499
Come on. David. What's the matter?

221
00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:15.377
- It's nothing.
- Cut the shit. please.

222
00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:17.129
It's not your problem. Becca.

I've been thinking.

227
00:13:28.682 --> 00:13:29.683
Hmm.

228
00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:32.144
Go light

Don't you worry. I've got your back!

230
00:13:36.065 --> 00:13:38.526

299
00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:25.312
What was that?

300
00:18:25.979 --> 00:18:27.314
Don't tell the crew.

301
00:18:28.315 --> 00:18:29.316

You knew that.
If normal meds can't cut it.

305
00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:49.586
it's time to slow down.

306
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.922
Can't watch you do this to yourself.

307
00:18:52.005 --> 00:18:54.091
Scale back your cyberware.

308
00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:56.093
I can't do that.

309
00:18:56.176 --> 00:18:57.176
Why not?

310
00:18:58.137 --> 00:19:02.307
Because of Maine and my mom. Both
had plans for me. left me things to do.

311
00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:05.394
Stuff I ain't done yet.

312
00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:09.648
But you really... David.
you can't go on like this.

313
00:19:09.731 --> 00:19:10.983
I'll be fine.

314
00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:15.529
Honestly believe that?
Really think you're special?

315
00:19:16.613 --> 00:19:18.490
<i>Handled the Sandy. didn't I?</i>

316
00:19:19.449 --> 00:19:20.909
<i>Definitely ain't normal.</i>

317
00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:26.165
So. you have a higher tolerance
than everyone else. that's all.

318
00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:29.251
Doesn't mean you're not human. you know.

319
00:19:31.378 --> 00:19:33.755
- I killed someone.
- Huh?

320
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:37.509

321
00:19:37.593 --> 00:19:40.637

322
00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:44.516
<i>She was a bystander.</i>

323
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.268
<i>A normal person.</i>

324
00:19:47.102 --> 00:19:48.729

<i>I lost count. Grew numb to it.</i>

327
00:19:55.694 --> 00:19:59.072
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I really am losing it.

328
00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:00.698
David. look.

329
00:20:01.408 --> 00:20:05.454
I ain't normal.
Said so yourself before. I'm different.

330
00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:07.789
- You're not.
- I am!

331
00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:10.459
You're not.

332
00:20:10.542 --> 00:20:13.045
- You just don't get it.
- Huh?

333
00:20:13.128 --> 00:20:17.341
You know. when Maine died.
didn't expect you to leave us too.

334
00:20:17.424 --> 00:20:19.051
I had to.

335
00:20:19.134 --> 00:20:20.636
I'm not mad.

336
00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:21.720
Why not?

337
00:20:21.803 --> 00:20:24.723
You deserve a way
out of this life.

338
00:20:24.806 --> 00:20:27.726
David. no. I... I'm not trying to...

339
00:20:27.809 --> 00:20:30.062
That mean you'll come back?

340
00:20:30.896 --> 00:20:34.316
You and me again. Turn back the clock.

341
00:20:38.403 --> 00:20:40.155
Can't quite do that yet.

342
00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:42.574
- Need just a little more time.
- What for?

343
00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:45.452
There's something I have to do.

344
00:20:46.703 --> 00:20:47.703
Can't tell me?

345
00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:49.581
Wish I could.

346
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.501
- Just say it.
- Can't.

347
00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:54.445
'Cause you don't trust me?

348
00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:56.713
I'm sorry.

349
00:20:59.007 --> 00:21:00.801
Whatever. Forget it.

350
