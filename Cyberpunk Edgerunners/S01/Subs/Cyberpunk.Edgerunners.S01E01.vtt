[David] You said you didn't have
the eddies when I asked. so...

170
00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:16.782
[Gloria] I was waiting for payday!

171
00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:19.952
You know we don't got that kind of cash
just lying around.

172
00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:22.997
Can't you sit still a minute? [sighs]

173
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:28.044
[David] You know.
I've been thinkin' lately.

174
00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:29.545
[Gloria] About what?

175
00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:33.174
[David] Maybe I drop out.
Find some work or whatever.

176
00:10:33.257 --> 00:10:34.842
[Gloria] Do you hear yourself?

177
00:10:34.925 --> 00:10:37.887
[David] C'mon. seriously.
You know we can't afford those repairs.

178
00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:43.684
Plus. you got no idea just how bad
I stand out compared to all of them.

179
00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:47.355
Anyone sides a true blue corpo
gets shit on.

180
00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:49.357
Even if I do graduate.
they'll never accept me.

181
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.984
No kid from Santo will ever be a suit.

182
00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:53.986
I don't wanna be one anyway.

183
00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:58.783
So. you tell me.

184
00:10:58.866 --> 00:11:01.410
What have I been busting
my ass for then. huh?

185
00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:05.456
Everything I do. I do for you. D.

186
00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:06.832
Don't you see that?

187
00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:11.045
[sighs] You're breaking my heart. Miho.

188
00:11:11.128 --> 00:11:12.129
Wait. What?

189
00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:16.801
My sweet baby boy. So smart. so talented.

190
00:11:16.884 --> 00:11:18.135
You're everything to me.

191
00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:22.056
I want to give you a fighting chance
in this city and a good education.

192
00:11:22.139 --> 00:11:26.936
It's why I put in all of those hours.
Why I'm never home.

193
00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:30.606
[David] Uh. I'm sorry.

194
00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:35.027
Shouldn't have brought it up.
Don't cry. Mom.

195
00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:37.738
[Gloria] Think I don't know
how they treat you?

196
00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:39.740
Think I don't get treated the same way?

197
00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:43.577
But that's why you gotta prove them wrong.

198
00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:45.913
You have to work hard
and rise through the ranks.

199
00:11:45.996 --> 00:11:50.042
My son at Arasaka Tower top floor!
I can just see it.

200
00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:52.586
You've got this. D. You're my son.

201
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.880
Yeah. well. easier said than done.

217
00:12:57.735 --> 00:12:59.195

00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:00.278
Hey. wait!

219
00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:03.908
[man] Secure the policyholder.
Leave them to the city meat wagons.

220
00:13:03.991 --> 00:13:05.701
- [woman] Copy that.
- [David] What?

221
00:13:05.784 --> 00:13:08.454
What the hell? Hey! Where are you going?

222
00:13:09.413 --> 00:13:10.706
Shit!

223
00:13:10.789 --> 00:13:12.708
No way. Just gonna leave us here?

224
00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:15.711

231
00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.067
[doctor] Surgery was a success.

232
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:41.195
Your mother hasn't come to just yet.
but she's stable.

233
00:13:41.278 --> 00:13:43.405
Need her to stay a few more nights.

234
00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:45.783
Oh. Then. is it okay if I see her?

235
00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:49.537
No can do. buddy.
Visitation ain't part of your package.

236
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.038
Oh. Right.

237
00:13:51.121 --> 00:13:53.999
Anyway. I should get started
on the paperwork.

238
00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:55.501
Brought your mom's things.

239
00:13:55.584 --> 00:13:58.462
And don't forget to zip us those eds.
Got three days.

240
00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:00.047
- Uh...
- Yeah.

241
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:01.525
[doctor] There's a reason everyone
in Night City

242
00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:03.133
- wants insurance.
- [sighs]

243
00:14:03.217 --> 00:14:04.218
Stay safe now.

244
00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:07.471
[David] Yeah. hoop ship. Version back.

245
00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:10.766
Is that all? You low-balling me? Huh?

246

Nah. forget it. choom.

Just enough. She saved so much.
Never knew.

256

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:02.484
if I was interested
and the price was right?

266
00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:05.112
Not selling. Just want an estimate.

[man] Our class.
You're not welcome. Got it?

[David] Huh? If this is about yesterday...

283
00:16:12.012 --> 00:16:14.223
- Who said anything about yesterday?
- [David] What?

284
00:16:14.306 --> 00:16:17.893
You probably figure I give you a hard time
'cause you're poor. Simply untrue.

285
00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:19.979
I'm rather charitably inclined.

286
00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:22.481
Not your fault you were born
on the wrong side of society.

287
00:16:22.564 --> 00:16:25.359
[inhales] There's no rule

- That right there!
- Hmm...

294
00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:39.456

Just drop out. why don't ya?

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.667
- Huh?
- You're a misfit. an anomaly.

296

Human but trash. and there's nothing
that can change that.

Rot in you runs as deep
as your bones. Martinez.

298
00:16:48.424 --> 00:16:51.844
Best you can do
is not spread it to the rest of us.

299
00:16:51.927 --> 00:16:53.470
Did I just short-circ?

300
00:16:53.554 --> 00:16:56.432
Said you didn't care
as long as I paid tuition.

301

00:17:06.942 --> 00:17:09.653
You know. since we're chatting.
I've just always wondered.

307
00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:13.115
How could she afford to send you
to Arasaka Academy anyway?

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:16.118
