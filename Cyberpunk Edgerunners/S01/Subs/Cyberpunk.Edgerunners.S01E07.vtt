00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.773
Got ants in your pants. Julio?

2
00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:24.858
No way!

3
00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:28.236
Wakako's bitch. right?
Newby-boobs she stuck us with.

4
00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:29.571
Heard you're David's fan.

5
00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:32.574
But what
do you mean "stuck with us"?

6
00:00:32.657 --> 00:00:34.868
Wow! You're that!

7
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:36.870
You're actually a fans now.

8
00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:39.831
Probably because you got all swole.

9
00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:40.914
Got iron?

10
00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:42.917
- Huh?
- Carrying. right?

11
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.878
Yeah. I've got a Lexington.

12
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:46.521
Don't cut it.

13
00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:49.507
Peashooter like that
won't even dent Maelstrom metal.

14
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.009
Try this one out.

15
00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:54.429
Seriously. choom? A Satara!

16
00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:56.139
Fuck me. Nova!

17
00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:58.308
Tech shotties. man.

18
00:00:58.391 --> 00:00:59.684
Preem as hell.

19
00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:01.478
Charged-up shots.

20
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:05.190
Oh yeah. Boom!

21
00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:06.483
Boom!

22
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.151
Boom!

23
00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.088
- Knock it off!
- Wait! Watch my knees!

24
00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:11.905
Wait. Knees.

25
00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:14.824
So annoying! Why!

26
00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.367
Just remember to stay behind me.

27
00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:17.911
And be smart. Don't rush.

28
00:01:17.994 --> 00:01:21.915
You mean you want me to take rear?
Hey. I ain't no newb. man

29
00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:23.666
Attention. ladies.

30
00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:25.919

<i>Can't ping them all for quickhacks.
Not enough time.</i>

41
00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:08.646
<i>Front door's a dead zone. That's crystal.</i>

42
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.982
<i>So. plan B. Find the back door.
Definitely.</i>

43
00:03:11.065 --> 00:03:13.401
Easy-peasy. Plan C's my pick.

44
00:03:13.484 --> 00:03:14.485
Agreed.

45
00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.738
<i>No backdoor swoop-in? Why?</i>

46
00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:18.656
<i>Knock yourself out. Get to it</i>

47
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.992
<i>Hey. wait. Don't leave me.</i>

48
00:03:21.075 --> 00:03:22.911
Front door's all. looks like to me.

49
00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:24.996
You think. move.

50
00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:32.253
Hey. Who ordered lunch. mate?
You little babies lost?

51
00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:34.756
Think they're here to scout something?

52
00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:37.258
You dirtbags wanna get punked?

53
00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:39.510
Better start talking now. scumbag.

54
00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:41.971
before I drill you a fresh eyehole.

55
00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.765
You better stop before I do the same.

56
00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:46.768
Yeehaw!

57
00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:51.522
<i>Tagging complete. Short circ incoming.</i>

58
00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:52.440
Done.

59
00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:54.776
Not a millisec to spare. Mr. Plan C.

60
00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:57.153
Oh! They've got a netrunner!

61
00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:08.289
I don't wanna die. man.

62
00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:10.541
<i>Damn. Missed a few. All yours.</i>

63
00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.752
Come on! Come on! Let's go.

64
00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:15.088
Toys run dry.

65
00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:18.091
- That little bitch ran out of juice!
- Fuck her up!

66
00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:21.010
And now. here comes the big guns!

67
00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:24.097
A goddamn turret!

68
00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:26.682
<i>Kiwi.</i>

69
00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:29.352
Hey! Runner's grabbed a...

70
00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:32.355
Please. Kiwi. Give me some. Kiwi.

71
00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:47.912
Tiny birds. Aren't you scared?

72
00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:50.832
Yo! The fuck. Is that human?

73
00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:51.915
Huh?

74
00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:02.885
Did you never learn to fly?

75
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.650
Time for major dick show.

76
00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:33.458
No. thanks. choom.
I know how to fly just fine.

77
00:05:38.796 --> 00:05:41.007
Nova! Zoot-zoot-zoot. bang!

78
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.901
Those your fancy new leg implants?

79
00:05:42.925 --> 00:05:44.278
Looking damn good.

80
00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:46.345
<i>No more. All clear. Last one.</i>

81
00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:50.641
Room behind you. Target's there.
Her. others too. All friendlies.

82
00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:51.601
<i>Roger. roger.</i>

83
00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:53.728
Yo! Back room. On it.

84
00:05:53.811 --> 00:05:55.289
- Wait! Julio!
- Bang!

85
00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:57.231
- Watch out for...
- Bang!

86
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:10.870
Isabella Morgan. you in here?

87
00:06:12.955 --> 00:06:15.124
I'm here 'cause your dad put out an SOS.

88
00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.043
You're safe now.

89
00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:24.634
<i>Wakako. there?</i>

90
00:06:25.426 --> 00:06:27.637
<i>You safely secured the target. I hear.</i>

91
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.098
<i>Our client will be pleased.</i>

92
00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:33.267
<i>Yes. that Isabella was saved.
not-not butchered like cattle.</i>

93
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.393
<i>Just did my part.</i>

94
00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:38.397
<i>Yes. Most impressive.
True. The rumors of you proved true.</i>

95
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:39.857
<i>Oh. sorry about Julio.</i>

96
00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:41.943
No. no. Do not apologize.

97
00:06:42.026 --> 00:06:45.029
<i>The boy. fool.
insisted on the work with you.</i>

98
00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:47.156
<i>Not ready. I said. Not ready. indeed.</i>

99
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.409
<i>Any new lead we get.
we-we will be in touch. David.</i>

100
00:06:51.035 --> 00:06:52.912
<i>Yeah. Good doing biz.</i>

101
00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:04.506
Thank you kindly.

102
00:07:05.007 --> 00:07:07.343
Appreciate the ride. Falco. Really.

103
00:07:07.426 --> 00:07:09.762
Always happy to keep the engine rolling.

104
00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:13.516
Come on. Dependable
wheelmen are hard to find.

105
00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:17.353
Oh. not sure about that. You've
gathered yourself quite the fan club.

106
00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.938
Oh. Julio. you mean?

107
00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:22.442
Knew that goose was bluffing
the moment we met.

108
00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:28.239
We'd land better talent if we
were all vets. Not everyone's like Maine.

109
00:07:28.322 --> 00:07:30.116
willing to take a chance on us.

110
00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:31.993
Have to admit.
when I got the call.

111
00:07:32.076 --> 00:07:34.579
I took you for a pusher-punk wannabe.

112
00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:36.497
Truth is. you were.

113
00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:41.711
But now? Well...

114
00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:44.964
Expect you'll fly higher
than Maine ever did.

115
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.303
Right. Gonna roll
before this all turns to goop.

116
00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:52.472
Buzz me for your next big gig. huh?

117
00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:55.725
Till then. Later. David. Kiwi.

118
00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:57.977
- Yeah.
- Later.

119
00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:00.980
Honestly?

120
00:08:01.063 --> 00:08:04.317
I doubted you had it in you.
to take the reins.

121
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.278
Couldn'ta. Not without
the city's preemest runner.

122
00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:10.698
Both know you don't mean me.
Where is she?

123
00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:15.244
Been asking her?

124
00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:18.706
Not anymore. Kinda gave up trying.

125
00:08:18.789 --> 00:08:21.417
Never pegged her as the type
to get all shook-up.

126
00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:26.130
More than what happened
to Maine and Dorio is at play. I think.

127
00:08:27.423 --> 00:08:31.844
<i>At the warehouse.
Lucy was acting. I don't know. strange.</i>

128
00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:33.304
Strange how?

129
00:08:33.387 --> 00:08:36.849
Hard to say. Whole thing's kind of a blur.
It might have been nothing.

130
00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:42.188
By the way.

131
00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:45.775
Wasn't it you who brought Lucy onboard.
found her a spot in the crew?

132
00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:46.692
That's right.

133
00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:49.111
She. like. ever talk to you about her past
or anything?

134
00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:53.241
Most of the cybes in our league
don't bring up the old days.

135
00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:57.286
Shame. greed. Some.
Whatever.

136
00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.998
Either you're looking for a way out.

137
00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:03.167
or a way up. doesn't matter.

138
00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:06.003
- Yo. yo. yo!
- Hmm?

139
00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:07.797
David. why the long face?

140
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.884
This nagging old hag keeping you
off the dancefloor?

141
00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:17.014
Although. some edgerunners die
in more shame than they started with.

142
00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:19.433
Yo. It ain't right to badmouth the dead.

143
00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:23.271
It's not my bro's fault
he got zeroed by some bare-dick psycho.

144
00:09:23.354 --> 00:09:27.233
Oh. whatevs! Have you ever seen
David dance? It's a riot.

145
00:09:27.316 --> 00:09:29.819
Sounds preem.
but I think I'm gonna bounce.

146
00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:32.697
- I gotta stop by Doc's.
- Seriously? Again?

147
00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.866
Been tellin' that bastard
you desperately need a dance chip.

148
00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.594
- At least a pop hit grind!
- Will do.

149
00:09:37.618 --> 00:09:39.287
See ya.

150
00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:44.667
Hey! I ain't good at playing just friends.

151
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.169
Considered shaking up your approach?

152
00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:48.546
Yeah? How you figure?

153
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.756
'Stead of hot and loud.

154
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.926
I try cold. distant. and nerdy?

155
00:09:57.138 --> 00:10:00.850
It's an oversized faucet.
Arm socket connector's warped.

156
00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:03.561
Jamming that fucker in was a miracle.

157
00:10:03.644 --> 00:10:05.730
My advice. trash it.

158
00:10:05.813 --> 00:10:08.316
Got all kinds of next-gen chrome out back.

159
00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:09.479
I know you got the scratch.

160
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.319
Nah. this one's good.

161
00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:14.822
Tsk. Fine. It's your funeral.

162
00:10:14.905 --> 00:10:19.118
Got any fresh muscle reinforcers?
Kiroshi's new model. maybe?

163
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:22.371
Excuse me. Didn't know I had
a corm jack on my table.

164
00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:23.581
Oh. come on. I'm not.

165
00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:25.541
You need to chill. choom.

166
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.753
Unless you want a strict diet
of immunoblockers.

167
00:10:28.836 --> 00:10:30.921
I'm doing just fine. Doc.

168
00:10:31.005 --> 00:10:32.548
Better than fine. actually.

169
00:10:33.674 --> 00:10:36.344
It's like. I feel better in metal
than in my own skin.

170
00:10:36.427 --> 00:10:40.806
Well. your affinity for cyberware
is fucking nuts. I'll grant you that.

171
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.934
Ain't never seen a kid
bogged out quite like this.

172
00:10:44.018 --> 00:10:46.812
Lotta other peeps woulda cut by now.

173
00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.981
Believe yourself to be special?

174
00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:51.400
Must just be special. I guess.

175
00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:54.862
Ha! Makes you
Adam Smasher 2.0. choom.

176
00:10:54.945 --> 00:10:56.489
- Adam who?
- Christ.

177
00:10:56.572 --> 00:10:58.908
All this time
and you're still a fucking newb.

178
00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:01.661
Adam Smasher. Name to know.

179
00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:05.456
<i>To some. a hero of the 4th Corporate War.</i>

180
00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:09.710
<i>to others. a fully cyborged
boogeyman. a walking nightmare.</i>

181
00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:13.297
<i>But to all. a living legend. a skinny one.</i>

182
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:16.258
<i>What kind of legend?</i>

183
00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:20.513
The kind that fills graveyards
on Arasaka's orders.

184
00:11:20.596 --> 00:11:22.264
An urban myth. that's all.

185
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:25.559
Kiwi?

186
00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:27.204
<i>What... What's up?</i>

187
00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:30.064
<i>Afterlife. Stop by. Can you come?</i>

188
00:11:30.147 --> 00:11:32.566
<i>Party's rolling. By the bar.
How many now?</i>

189
00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.069
<i>No. no. Possible client.
Wants to meet you.</i>

190
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.572
- David.
- Yo. 'Sup. Kiwi?

191
00:11:39.865 --> 00:11:41.826
Good luck.

192
00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:47.081
I believe this is the first
we've met. Mister Martinez.

193
00:11:47.164 --> 00:11:50.584
Not exactly. Saw you swing by once
to talk to Maine.

194
00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:55.005
Indeed. Well. it's a pleasure.

195
00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:56.465
The name's Faraday.

196
00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.262
Got a job for me?

197
00:12:01.345 --> 00:12:04.974
Where's the fire?
Let me buy you a drink.

198
00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:08.853
I've heard a great deal about you. David.

199
00:12:08.936 --> 00:12:11.856
You're building quite the reputation.

200
00:12:11.939 --> 00:12:14.859
The Sandevistan from Santo
is one name I've heard.

201
00:12:15.609 --> 00:12:17.570
Got more than just the Sandy now.

202
00:12:17.653 --> 00:12:22.116
True. It's difficult
to spot the 'ganic amidst all that steel.

203
00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:26.245
Maine and I had an arrangement.
as you may know.

204
00:12:26.328 --> 00:12:27.580
I heard about it.

205
00:12:27.663 --> 00:12:30.332
He understood the need for crew chemistry.

206
00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:32.501
- Yeah.
- But as you saw.

207
00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:35.296
his flaw was in personal attachment.

208
00:12:35.379 --> 00:12:38.632
Familiarity muddies the mind.
leads to ruin.

209
00:12:39.216 --> 00:12:41.969
I hear you're also a teambuilder.

210
00:12:42.052 --> 00:12:44.805
Keep biz and private seperate.
if that's what you mean.

211
00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:49.852
I need convincing that you can work
at Maine's level. deliver as he did.

212
00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:53.481
- A test?
- You're welcome to think of it that way.

213
00:12:53.564 --> 00:12:56.650
Test all you want.
but we don't do jobs on the cheap.

214
00:12:56.734 --> 00:13:00.654
I assure you.
Nothing from my desk is cheap.

215
00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:08.787
A job from Militech?

216
00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:11.165
Arasaka's bitter rival.

217
00:13:11.248 --> 00:13:15.252
Megacorps offer the most lucrative
contracts. That's no great secret.

218
00:13:15.336 --> 00:13:17.505
Do you foresee a problem with this?

219
00:13:18.672 --> 00:13:21.675
- Not at all.
- That's what I like to hear.

220
00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:24.595
There's a contract
I'd like you to take over.

221
00:13:24.678 --> 00:13:26.680
It should seem familiar.

222
00:13:26.764 --> 00:13:29.016
You talking about Tanaka.
the data heist gig?

223
00:13:29.099 --> 00:13:30.643
I received a report

224
00:13:30.726 --> 00:13:34.104
- that Tanaka posess no relevant data.
- Yeah.

225
00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:38.067
But I also learned how you
managed to pierce Arasaka's ICE.

226
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:42.196
A new netrunner on the crew cracked it.
And without Kiwi's help.

227
00:13:42.279 --> 00:13:45.533
True. Our crew has had
some luck with runners lately.

228
00:13:45.616 --> 00:13:48.536
Excellent. However.
I hear she's gone dark.

229
00:13:49.119 --> 00:13:52.039
<i>Yeah. Been taking a break
since that gig.</i>

230
00:13:52.122 --> 00:13:55.543
<i>But why?
Such a waste of talent. potential.</i>

231
00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:57.795
Her heart's just not in it.

232
00:13:57.878 --> 00:14:01.048
I suggest you give her a nudge
in the right direction.

233
00:14:01.131 --> 00:14:03.425
Easier said than done. Huh?

234
00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:09.223
But Arasaka knows Militech's
after them. Ain't that right?

235
00:14:09.306 --> 00:14:10.432
Them and everyone else.

236
00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:13.811
So. what's Militech after
that they'd risk such a ballsy move?

237
00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:18.190
That is for me to know.
It is certainly no concern of yours.

238
00:14:18.774 --> 00:14:21.694
Unneeded details also muddy the mind.

239
00:14:21.777 --> 00:14:23.696
Learn anything new that might help us?

240
00:14:23.779 --> 00:14:27.700
I'm afraid not. But good things
come to those who act.

241
00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:31.328
First. prove you're worth my time.

242
00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:42.714
You're home.

243
00:14:46.176 --> 00:14:47.553
Pretty late.

244
00:14:49.179 --> 00:14:50.681
Got a little caught up.

245
00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:53.475
Victory lap at Minjung's?

246
00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:54.435
Hm-mmm.

247
00:14:54.518 --> 00:14:56.395
Any hiccups today?

248
00:14:56.478 --> 00:14:58.689
We did lose someone. yeah.

249
00:14:58.772 --> 00:15:00.024
Who?

250
00:15:00.107 --> 00:15:02.359
Rookie solo. Wakako's.

251
00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:05.362
But everything else
went alright?

252
00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:08.782
Nothing tricky.
Kid just got excited. Hasty.

253
00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:11.243
Now. why does that sound familiar?

254
00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:12.870
Watch it.

255
00:15:14.955 --> 00:15:16.582
- Hey.
- Hmm?

256
00:15:16.665 --> 00:15:18.959
Landed something pretty big for us today.

257
00:15:19.043 --> 00:15:20.586
Sounds like fun.

258
00:15:20.669 --> 00:15:24.214
So. uhm. have you considered
coming back to the crew?

259
00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:27.384
Two netrunners on one team
sounds like a crowd.

260
00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:30.429
Lucy. we both know I'd always
rather have you around.

261
00:15:30.512 --> 00:15:32.389
- Please. David.
- Huh?

262
00:15:32.973 --> 00:15:34.892
I just need a little more time.

263
00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:38.896
Of course. No problem.

264
00:15:40.397 --> 00:15:41.523
More diving today?

265
00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:43.359
Hm-mmm.

266
00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:45.402
Buy a runnersuit. why don't you.

267
00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:47.029
Don't need one.

268
00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:49.323
Should get you
a new chair at least.

269
00:15:49.406 --> 00:15:51.784
That ice bath can't be comfy.

270
00:15:51.867 --> 00:15:55.704
Thanks. but never liked
chairs. suits.

271
00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:56.664
Oh.

272
00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:58.624
Sorry. Didn't know that.

273
00:16:03.337 --> 00:16:05.673
- David?
- Huh?

274
00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:07.675
Come on.

275
00:16:08.258 --> 00:16:09.258
Uh...

276
00:16:15.057 --> 00:16:17.351
Whoa! Look at all those stars!

277
00:16:17.434 --> 00:16:19.395
Can't get a view like this in the city.

278
00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:21.522
Maybe I'll catch one.

279
00:16:21.605 --> 00:16:23.375
You're lucky you're cute.

280
00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:25.234
Sure wish the moon was out.

281
00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:28.570
You can see the stars better. brighter.
when it's stays away.

282
00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:29.697
Really?

283
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.366
Really. really. The moon outshines 'em.

284
00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:34.868
Are you sure you went to Arasaka Academy?

285
00:16:34.952 --> 00:16:38.080
- I'm dropped out. remember?
- Ah. right.

286
00:16:38.163 --> 00:16:41.875
You know. I've never been
outside the city before.

287
00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.085
Is that right?

288
00:16:44.128 --> 00:16:47.339
But you have had a life
outside Night City once?

289
00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:54.304
Looks like a prison from here.
A cage of light.

290
00:16:57.683 --> 00:16:59.560
Might not remember...

291
00:16:59.643 --> 00:17:00.978
Hmm?

292
00:17:01.061 --> 00:17:03.772
Said once you and I were
worlds apart.

293
00:17:04.898 --> 00:17:06.025
Yeah.

294
00:17:06.108 --> 00:17:07.609
What'd you mean by that?

295
00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:12.322
Rather not say?

296
00:17:14.908 --> 00:17:16.452
You'd rather not hear.

297
00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:19.747
It's just...
I'd like to know more about you.

298
00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:25.502
<i>Arasaka.</i>

299
00:17:25.586 --> 00:17:27.254
<i>- Arasaka?
- Yup.</i>

300
00:17:28.005 --> 00:17:29.882
<i>I was born in another country.</i>

301
00:17:29.965 --> 00:17:32.009
<i>raised in an Arasaka facility.</i>

302
00:17:32.843 --> 00:17:34.178
<i>There were 13 of us.</i>

303
00:17:34.261 --> 00:17:38.515
<i>Kids who passed a proficiency test
were tagged to become netrunners.</i>

304
00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:42.269
<i>Kids who wouldn't be missed anywhere else.</i>

305
00:17:42.352 --> 00:17:46.607
<i>"We'll serve the world's most powerful
megacorp one day."</i>

306
00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:51.278
<i>That dream got us through
the toughest days. the toughest training.</i>

307
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:55.657
<i>Its the dream we were given.
A dream we never questioned.</i>

308
00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:58.494
<i>One day. training was done.</i>

309
00:17:58.577 --> 00:18:02.122
<i>We expected corp assignments
the world over.</i>

310
00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:05.167
<i>Instead. they moved us underground.</i>

311
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:09.588
<i>And day in. day out.
they forced us to dive.</i>

312
00:18:09.671 --> 00:18:12.216
<i>Old Net's where they sent us.</i>

313
00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:13.801
Wait. The Old Net?

314
00:18:13.884 --> 00:18:18.555
But I thought that whole system collapsed
something like 50 years ago. didn't it?

315
00:18:18.639 --> 00:18:22.726
Brought down by history's greatest
netrunner. creator of daemons.

316
00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:27.147
He was a true savant. super hacker.
legend Rache Bartmoss.

317
00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:28.732
Oh. shit. yeah.

318
00:18:28.816 --> 00:18:32.736
That guy corrupted like 78 percent
of the global net in single day.

319
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.366
<i>Hm-mmm.
DataKrash virus shattered cyberspace.</i>

320
00:18:37.449 --> 00:18:41.161
<i>Broke the Net into a scattered mosaic
of isolated localnets.</i>

321
00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:44.414
<i>Connection severed. data lost.
It was chaos.</i>

322
00:18:45.374 --> 00:18:48.335
<i>Arasaka's purpose
lies somewhere in the Old Net.</i>

323
00:18:48.418 --> 00:18:51.880
<i>They're searching for legacy info.
lost knowledge.</i>

324
00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:57.261
<i>All of us kids. we were soldiers sent into
a nest of daemons and.</i>

325
00:18:58.428 --> 00:19:02.057
<i>Only an advanced runner can interface
using their whole mind.</i>

326
00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:03.559
<i>A deep-dive.</i>

327
00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:07.396
<i>It gives shape and form
to cyberspace. a way to traverse it.</i>

328
00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:10.399
<i>But whenever we uncovered
any rare data cache...</i>

329
00:19:14.903 --> 00:19:17.573
<i>...Rogue AIs would find us and swarm.</i>

330
00:19:20.075 --> 00:19:22.661
<i>We were picked off one by one.</i>

331
00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:28.709
<i>More empty chairs after each dive.
And my hope. each dive would be my last.</i>

332
00:19:28.792 --> 00:19:31.170
<i>Wasn't long before there were only
a handful of us left.</i>

333
00:19:32.796 --> 00:19:37.009
<i>We were chasing someone else's dream.
throwing down our lives to do it.</i>

334
00:19:37.092 --> 00:19:41.555
<i>So we realized. "If we're goners.
why not die chasing our own dream?"</i>

335
00:19:42.764 --> 00:19:45.142
<i>The tech staff didn't stand a chance.</i>

336
00:19:45.225 --> 00:19:47.436
<i>Not in the face of the skills
they'd taught us.</i>

337
00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.532
<i>I ran and ran.</i>

338
00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:02.451
<i>Heard shots. my friend's screams.</i>

339
00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:05.037
<i>But I never looked back.</i>

340
00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:16.381
<i>Next clear memory I have
is of a junkyard.</i>

341
00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:20.469
<i>Home. I guess.
But I was too scared to stay long.</i>

342
00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:23.722
<i>I roamed. place to place.</i>

343
00:20:25.933 --> 00:20:29.478
<i>But there's no place like Night City
if you wanna hide.</i>

344
00:20:30.103 --> 00:20:32.481
And even now.
still feel like they're chasing you?

345
00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:35.192
Not really. I guess.

346
00:20:35.275 --> 00:20:37.236
Maybe I've just grown
too comfortable here.

347
00:20:37.945 --> 00:20:40.614
Or maybe I've grown used to being scared.

348
00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:43.575
Your hand.

349
00:20:43.659 --> 00:20:46.245
It's nothing. It'll be fine in a sec.

350
00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:50.123
Haven't changed. have you?
Still chasing someone else's dream.

351
00:20:55.837 --> 00:20:57.437
It's not like I don't understand.

352
00:21:00.592 --> 00:21:05.264
Just that... that things are different now.
Can't be afraid for myself anymore.

353
00:21:06.056 --> 00:21:07.391
Only if you're now is...

354
00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:08.892
Someday. you'll...

355
00:21:18.568 --> 00:21:22.197
<i>Yes.
I managed to retrieve most of the data.</i>

356
00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:24.783
<i>But the vital's file
for one of the test subjects</i>

357
00:21:24.866 --> 00:21:26.702
<i>was completely corrupted.</i>

358
00:21:27.744 --> 00:21:30.247
<i>Yes. Manipulated deliberately.</i>

359
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:32.666
<i>No trace in the ICE. No.</i>

360
00:21:32.749 --> 00:21:34.501
<i>But this level of precision.</i>

361
00:21:34.584 --> 00:21:37.170
<i>well. there's only a handful
of netrunners capable of it.</i>

362
00:21:38.922 --> 00:21:42.718
<i>No. I don't believe that.
Tanaka had no reason to do so.</i>

363
00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:47.139
<i>My assumption. His system
was breached when he was captured.</i>

364
00:21:47.222 --> 00:21:49.975
<i>Understood.
I'll do what I can do to restore it.</i>

365
00:21:51.184 --> 00:21:52.227
