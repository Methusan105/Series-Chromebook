[David] Nah. out of my price range.

15
00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:53.988
[Maine] Rebecca gave the nod.
They're all yours. No strings.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.462
Got my heart set on something else.

Braindance senator.
He's got a cult following.

Get's his hands on a snuff

Piping hot fresh off the street.

Whatever JK tunes. he turns to gold.
Just don't get edits like anywhere else.

81
00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.021
It's no wonder his fans
keep coming back for more.

82
00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:35.108
Well. I'll be dumb. kid.
Didn't peg you for a superfreak.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.489
[Kiwi] Cute story.

86
00:04:41.572 --> 00:04:44.200
but do you know anything
that actually be useful?

87
00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.536
- Mostly he does custom-made.
- [Kiwi] What's that?

88
00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:50.957
[David] The spender expects exclusive
so JK tailors the dances special.

89
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.209
You know.

90
00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.669
And we care why?

91
00:04:54.752 --> 00:04:57.130
[David] For a custom edit.
Tanaka's gotta be there.

92
00:04:57.213 --> 00:04:58.548
Physically present.

93
00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:00.133
And probably alone.

94
00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:02.051
[Kiwi] Alone? How do you figure?

95
00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:05.555
Would you bring your bodyguard
to a fetish XBD tune-in?

96
00:05:07.348 --> 00:05:08.933
[Kiwi] Got a point.

97
00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:11.102
[Maine] Getting pretty sharp. dawg!

98
00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:13.479

101
00:05:17.191 --> 00:05:18.551
[David sighs in annoyance]
Nothing!

102
00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.530
[Maine] Faraday came
through with a lead on Tanaka.

103
00:05:22.613 --> 00:05:25.783
Seems our favorite suit
occasionally ditches his hustle

104
00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:28.077
and usual ride for Delamain.

105
00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.787
[Dorio] Going off-greed. huh?

106
00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:31.414
[Maine] But Delamain's air tight.

107
00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:34.000
Can't hope for a lock on position
or destination.

108
00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:36.627
[Kiwi] I did some digging into custom BDs.

109
00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:39.464
Mostly fat-cat buyers with deep pockets.

110
00:05:39.547 --> 00:05:41.591
corpo execs. celebs. gang bosses.

111
00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:44.844

112
00:05:44.927 --> 00:05:48.264
If we wanna know more.
we gonna have a word with the man himself.

113
00:05:48.347 --> 00:05:49.807
Yeah. but how?

114
00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:51.350
- We grab his skinny ass.

115
00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:52.894
[Kiwi] That will be easy.

116
00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:56.355
found out he's got a reservation
at Embers day after tomorrow.

117
00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:57.607
Table for one.

118
00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.358
[Lucy] Pretty damn sad. huh?

119
00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:02.862
And once he's all done.

- [gasping]

128
00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.693
I knew it! I knew it was you! Totally!

129
00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:43.778
Huge fan sir.

130
00:06:43.861 --> 00:06:46.906
You know a ripperdoc in Arroyo
who pushes XBDs?

131
00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:50.284
[David] I part-time for them
for a while selling your stuff!

132
00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:51.285
Is that right?

133
00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:53.621
Can I shake your hand?

134
00:06:53.704 --> 00:06:54.789

135
00:06:54.872 --> 00:06:56.791
[David] Uh. sorry...
[laughs awkwardly]

136
00:06:56.874 --> 00:06:58.751
Guess I'm a little star-struck.

137
00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:00.545
I have somewhere to be so if you'll...

138
00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:03.047

That son of a bitch pulled a fast one.

156

[panting]
What the hell happened?

157
00:07:42.336 --> 00:07:43.921
[Kiwi groaning]
They're gone.

[Kiwi] Got it.

163
00:07:53.097 --> 00:07:54.348

What did that creep fire off back there?

Some kind of EMP I think.

172
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.580
Hit Kiwi pretty hard.

173
00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:20.833
It's weird. ringed my bell too
but just for a quick minute.

174
00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:23.961
Wide range and it targets neural implants.

175
00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:26.088
Designed to neutralize runners clearly.

176
00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.716
- You seem fine?
- [Lucy] I was out of range.

177
00:08:29.383 --> 00:08:31.469
[Lucy] I'm more worried about David.

178
00:08:31.552 --> 00:08:33.846
Specially if that dick pops the EMP again.

179
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.224
He won't pop shit if we zero him.

180
00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:39.227
[scoffs]
You're pissed aren't yah?

181
00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:41.270
[Lucy] Just a little.

182
00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:42.730
[music fades]

183
00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:47.735

Huh?

188
00:09:04.877 --> 00:09:07.755
[ominous music continues]

189
00:09:07.838 --> 00:09:09.966
[breathes heavily]

190
00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:12.009
- [cop 1] Ah. Christ.
- [gasps]

191
00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:14.595
[cop 1] It was a fucking tragic
cyberpsycho. right?

192
00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:17.139
- [cop 2] No shit. let's head out.
- [breathing heavily]

193
00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.850
- [cop 2] Already hailed MaxTac.
- [footsteps]

194
00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:21.519
[cop 1] Hey look. another body.

195
00:09:21.602 --> 00:09:23.688
- [grunts]
- [cop 2] Hey. don't wander off. man.

196
00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:25.457
- [cop 2] What if you run into the perp?
- [gun cocks]

197
00:09:25.481 --> 00:09:27.275
[cop 1] Relax. They're long gone.

198
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.652
[breathing heavily. groaning]

199
00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:31.529
- [cop 1] Huh? Who's there?!
- [gasps]

200
00:09:31.612 --> 00:09:32.780
[cop 2] Cyberpsycho!

201
00:09:32.863 --> 00:09:34.091
- [David grunting]
- [cop 1] He's armed!

202
00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:35.875
- No! It wasn't me...
- [cop 2] Drop the gun!

203
00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:36.784
[cop 1] Don't move!

204
00:09:36.867 --> 00:09:38.929
- I just woke up in here...
- [cop 2] Drop it. you fucking psycho!

205
00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:40.538

208
00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:46.474

- [panting]

209
00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:49.004
[David grunts]

210
00:09:51.507 --> 00:09:52.925
[breathing heavily]

211
00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:55.928
- Got a cyberpsycho!
- Raise MaxTac now!

212
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.809
[David screaming]

213
00:10:01.892 --> 00:10:05.062

[breathing heavily]

218
00:10:15.364 --> 00:10:16.991
[cop 5] Shots fired back here!

219
00:10:17.658 --> 00:10:18.701
You bastard!

220
00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:30.963
[grunts]

You fucking monster.

235
00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:23.974
Wait! I didn't do it!

236
00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:26.143

[panting]

240
00:11:38.572 --> 00:11:40.050
- [Jimmy] So what do you think?
- [David breathing heavily]

241
00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:41.575
[Jimmy] A prim high. wasn't it?

242
00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:44.829
Experiencing your own death
instead of the others.

243
00:11:44.912 --> 00:11:47.331
[breathing heavily]
Are you shitting me?!

244
00:11:48.457 --> 00:11:50.126
[David] Prim high?
[panting]

245
00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:51.836
You're a fucking psychopath...

246
00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:54.839
[Jimmy scoffs]
And here I thought you were a fan!

247
00:11:55.881 --> 00:11:58.592
Most of them are whack jobs.

248
00:11:58.676 --> 00:12:01.345
- But you're a real cyberpunk. aren't you?
- [breathing heavily]

249
00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.222
[Jimmy] What is it you're after?

250
00:12:03.305 --> 00:12:05.516
Attempting to ambush me like that...

251
00:12:05.599 --> 00:12:06.517
[David panting]

252
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.769
[Jimmy] Clearly.
you've done your homework.

253
00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:10.604
Seen my other works perhaps?

254
00:12:10.688 --> 00:12:11.564
[breathes heavily]

255
00:12:11.647 --> 00:12:13.983
[Jimmy] Say the Edgerunner series?

256
00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:15.109
I have.

257
00:12:15.192 --> 00:12:16.026
[Jimmy] Mm-hmm.

258
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.612
[David] Seen most of your stuff.
[breathing heavily]

259
00:12:19.947 --> 00:12:21.490
[Jimmy] Wow. I'm flattered!

260
00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:25.828
Has it ever tickled your curiosity

261
00:12:25.911 --> 00:12:29.498
wondering how I get my hands
on so many cyberpsycho scrolls?

262
00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:30.582
Huh?

263
00:12:30.624 --> 00:12:33.711
[Jimmy] You see. all military prototypes

264
00:12:33.794 --> 00:12:36.755
come with a built-in braindance scroller.

265
00:12:37.506 --> 00:12:41.260
Some folks are willing to pay through
the nose for that kind of material.

266
00:12:41.343 --> 00:12:44.513
[suspenseful music]

267
00:12:45.347 --> 00:12:48.267
[Jimmy] Your sandevistan.
do you know wore it originally?

268
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.478
- [grunting]
- James Norris. that's who.

269
00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:53.314
All in all. Norris mowed down 27 people.

270
00:12:53.397 --> 00:12:56.775
But there where MaxTac finally
put an end to his killing streak.

271
00:12:56.859 --> 00:12:59.069
- [breathing heavily]
- Yes. Take my word.

272
00:12:59.153 --> 00:13:02.948
It's not often you find someone
who can go toe-to-toe with a Psycho Squad.

273
00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:04.867
Oh. my. What a gem.

274
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.037
Truly one of the best I've seen
in a long while.

275
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.206
[David breathes heavily]

276
00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:13.626
[Jimmy] I have stellar expectations
for you. too.

277
00:13:13.709 --> 00:13:17.880
And what a marvelous surprise
that you haven't snapped already.

278
00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:21.383
Fight all you want.
the Sandy will drive you mad. eventually.

279
00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:23.802
I cannot wait to capture it.

280
00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:26.388
I ain't gonna go psycho! No fucking way!

281
00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:30.643
A common belief that all chrome fiends
hold on to desperately.

282
00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:33.854
[Jimmy] They know they're sane
until they're not.

283
00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:34.938
No. not me!

284
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.398
Oh. yes. you too.

285
00:13:36.982 --> 00:13:39.068
[Jimmy] Another couple of tangos
with MaxTac

286
00:13:39.151 --> 00:13:42.154
and your brain will pop
like a party baloon.

287
00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:43.989
- [computer trilling]
- [Jimmy humming]

288
00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:45.199
[breathing heavily]
No. wait.

289
00:13:45.282 --> 00:13:47.826
You ain't gonna force me to watch
that BD again...

290
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.454
- [Jimmy laughing]
- No. stop!

291
00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:51.973
- [wobbling noise]
- [David] Cut it out!

292
00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:53.916
- [wobbling noise intensifies]
- No! Stop!

293
00:13:55.876 --> 00:13:56.794
[gasps]
Oh...

294
00:13:56.877 --> 00:13:58.037
- [Dorio grunts]
- [gun cocks]

295
00:13:58.546 --> 00:13:59.463
Not an inch!

[exciting music]

297
00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:05.469
[Lucy] Hands up...

298
00:14:06.053 --> 00:14:07.221
Or you die.

299
00:14:07.304 --> 00:14:09.473
[scoffs]
Hmm. you got me!

300
00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:12.476
[breathing heavily]

301
00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:15.229
- [beeping]
- [Dorio] How is he?

302
00:14:15.312 --> 00:14:17.189
[Lucy] He's in a BD. I think.

303
00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:19.273
- [Dorio] Can you get him out?
- [Lucy] I'm trying.

304
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.860
- [Jimmy] Need a hand?
- [Dorio] Connot!

305
00:14:21.944 --> 00:14:24.488
- [Lucy] Done!
- [breathing heavily. screaming]

306
00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:26.490
- [sparks]
- [groaning]

307
00:14:27.074 --> 00:14:29.535
- David! Hey. are you okay?
- [coughing] Yeah.

308
00:14:29.618 --> 00:14:32.204
Aw. what a shame.

309
00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:34.999
So? How might I assist you. fine people?

310
00:14:35.082 --> 00:14:37.626
Not here to kill. I am still alive.

311
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.420
It's not off the table.

312
00:14:39.503 --> 00:14:41.797
Calm down. I wish to cooperate.

313
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.591
Yeah. you catch on quick.

314

- Hmm...
- [drone whirring continues]

317
00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:52.391
- [Dorio] Oh. that better not be...
- [drone whirring]

318
00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:56.645
- [Dorio] Armed drones!
- [Jimmy] Bingo!

319
00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:59.899
- [Dorio] Call them off!
- [Jimmy] I'm afraid I can't.

320
00:14:59.982 --> 00:15:01.108
[Jimmy] Just enjoy the show.

321
00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:04.653
Custom spec. Fully bulletproof.
My pride and joy.

322
00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:08.240
Good luck making a dent
with your puny one-shots.

323
00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:10.618
[Dorio] 'Till I need to blow
your fucking head off!

324
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:13.078
[Jimmy scoffs]
Well. hardly the smartest thing.

325
00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:16.540
It wouldn't stop them from turning
you into a bloodstain on my floor.

326
00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:19.084
You better fucking pray they don't start
going open season

327
00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:21.378
- while I'm using you as a meat shield.
- [gunshots]

[metal clanks]

329
00:15:24.381 --> 00:15:26.634
It's always smart to have a spare.

330
00:15:26.717 --> 00:15:27.717
Goddamnit!

331
00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:31.805
Ah! Seems you're surrounded.
Ready to throw in the towel again?

332
00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:34.058
Mouthly shut! Lucy?

333
00:15:34.141 --> 00:15:35.809
- [beeping]
- I'm working on it.

334
00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:39.813
Need more time...

335
00:15:41.398 --> 00:15:42.398
[breathes heavily]

336
00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:48.197
