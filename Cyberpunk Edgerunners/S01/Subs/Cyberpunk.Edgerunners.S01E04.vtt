00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.350
<i>Faraday had it right.
He swapped venues.</i>

11
00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:24.018
<i>Ah! Dropped the ball on this.</i>

12
00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:25.979
<i>Sorry. It's a lost cause by now.</i>

13
00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:29.482
Arasaka's cleaning a house
over a stolen stretch. it can't be. eh?

14
00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:33.069
Hmm. Taking your ride.
whole thing makes a highway shit.

15
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.822
I wish Faraday tells us
what the fuck we're after.

16
00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:38.950
What's that thing.
"Biggest fish is the one that got away"?

17
00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:40.994
Should I dig deeper on Tanaka?

18
00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:44.706
No. sniffing around Arasaka's
business is a fixer's job.

19
00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:46.833
It's on him to give us a lead.

20
00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:48.835
Wouldn't ask too much to say.

21
00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:52.046
"I pay you to check the boxes
off my list."

22
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.550
Sure. but...
curiosity is killing me.

23
00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:58.595
Let me see Kiwi on it.
See what she can find.

24
00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:01.014
It ain't going to stop you.
baby doll.

25
00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:05.518
Meantime. you and me. let's go to town.

26
00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:20.909
<i>Bad. bad time kid. Now's bad.</i>

27
00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:23.995
Uh the word. What's the word?
I hadn't heard anything.

28
00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:27.540
<i>Said I'd call if any giggly
popped up.</i>

29
00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.959
Nothing? Still nada?
Take whatever you got.

30
00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.045
<i>Desperate looks ugly. rookie.</i>

31
00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:35.256
<i>Ed's all gone? Blow your last cut already?</i>

32
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.009
- Not Eddies. It's not what I mean.
<i>- Huh?</i>

33
00:03:38.092 --> 00:03:40.595
Learning. learning the ropes. me.

34
00:03:40.678 --> 00:03:43.014
You can't be my crutch.

35
00:03:43.097 --> 00:03:44.737
<i>Said yourself. right?</i>

36
00:03:45.683 --> 00:03:47.143
Right. fine.

37
00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:50.021
Hey! I'm looking for Aldo.

38
00:03:50.104 --> 00:03:52.649
Yeah? Who's looking now?

39
00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.692
Maine. He sent me.

40
00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:57.320
Ha? You Davis then?

41
00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:58.947
Uh...

42
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.199
- Huh?
- I'm David.

43
00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:05.328
- Davis?
- It's David! Not Davis! David!

44
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:08.706
What are you screaming for.
rude motherfucker?

45
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.501
Got it. David. Heard you.

46
00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.628
You're Pilar's carrying pigeon. yeah?

47
00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:14.711
Pilar's?

48
00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:17.006
It was you. wasn't it?

49
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.427
The punk kid who cleft and junked
Arasaka limo? Hell of an entrance.

50
00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:24.430
Yeah... my first real gig.

51
00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:27.684
Could have collected
five fat spots for it at least.

52
00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.978
if you hadn't gone and turned it to scrap.

53
00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:32.522
- Well. there's always next time.
- Ha?

54
00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:34.232
I'll do better next time!

55
00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:37.986
Next time. eh?

56
00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:41.990
Well. I guess. we'll see you if last time
wasn't just a beginner's luck.

57
00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:44.993
- What do you mean by that?
- Nothing personal.

58
00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:49.455
We'll find out soon if you're a shit
or just another shit's stain.

59
00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.542
Hear about that C-Psych
alone in Watson?

60
00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.377
They just keep popping up.

61
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.171
Yeah. two men patrol
flat-lined just like that.

62
00:04:57.255 --> 00:05:00.341
Yeah. Saw the scroll. poor fuckers.

63
00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:01.634
A single launcher hit

64
00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.262
turned them both into canned easy-peasy.

65
00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.162
Hey. David. my man!

66
00:05:12.186 --> 00:05:15.440
- What's going on? Everything good?
- I am... Uh. yeah!

67
00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:17.692
What's up. chum? You need something?

68
00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:18.985
Uh. yeah!

69
00:05:19.068 --> 00:05:21.904
Got this package here from Maine.
Is Pilar here?

70
00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:22.989
Ugh!

71
00:05:23.072 --> 00:05:24.324
Yo. bro. it's for you!

72
00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:25.825
- He's your brother?
- Ha?

73
00:05:25.908 --> 00:05:27.910
Maine sent you something. Come get it.

74
00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.496
Fucking finally!

75
00:05:31.205 --> 00:05:35.418
Wow! Is that the boy who'd killed
for a pair of cyberhands like this?

76
00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.587
Supreme!

77
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.507
You want me to excuse you or..?

78
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:43.801
Got anything else for me to do
or is that it?

79
00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:46.429
Bro. that's it for today?

80
00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:48.139
Yeah. fuck off!

81
00:05:48.222 --> 00:05:50.767
And. Becca. tip him on his way out.

82
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.770
Fuck it up for yourself. cheap-ass!

83
00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.313
It's bulletproof!

84
00:05:55.396 --> 00:05:57.690
So is that everything? Do I clock out now?

85
00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:59.901
Uh... Yeah. whatever.
It looks that way to me.

86
00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:01.194
Uh. no. I guess.

87
00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:05.198
Whoa! That's a tip?

88
00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:07.700
Damn. You're fucking adorable.

89
00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:10.536
- Huh!
- See you soon. dimples.

90
00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:15.374
<i>Hey. are you free tonight?</i>

91
00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:16.793
Whoa!

92
00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:25.927
You showed up?

93
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.471
You told me to come. so I did.

94
00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:30.681
Maine bullied me. so I had to.

95
00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.475
What? Maine did?

96
00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:34.894
<i>Why me?</i>

97
00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:38.064
<i>You're a stray. You ain't never
taken one in. a stray?</i>

98
00:06:38.147 --> 00:06:39.732
<i>Show some responsibility.</i>

99
00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:42.443
<i>He's yours. You said to keep him.</i>

100
00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:45.154
<i>Come on.
Kid's been hounding me for work.</i>

101
00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:48.825
<i>Whine-yap-yap. Walk that doug.
Tucker him out.</i>

102
00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:51.702
Assmunch.

103
00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:53.246
Fuck that guy!

104
00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:55.665
I'll say. it's my day-off too.

105
00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:57.917
Sorry. you're stuck with me.

106
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.713
No offense but. chopsticks. narrow
torso. not exactly built like a punk.

107
00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:07.385
With that frame. look prime to tweak out
after one. maybe two more implants.

108
00:07:07.468 --> 00:07:09.804
I ain't weak.
if that's what you're getting at.

109
00:07:09.887 --> 00:07:11.139
Keep up then.

110
00:07:15.643 --> 00:07:17.353
Ever use one?

111
00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:19.313
Nope.

112
00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:21.899
Gloria never let you carry?

113
00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:23.443
It's time. we change that.

114
00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:26.487
What do you say? I could teach you
some tricks if you want.

115
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:30.450
Think. Sandevistan. I'll stick with that.

116
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:54.849
<i>- Hey.
- Yeah?</i>

117
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.269
I'm wondering. Are you a real netrunner?

118
00:07:58.352 --> 00:07:59.562
Clearly. And?

119
00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:02.982
Nothing. Just why would netrunners
have to. you know. run.

120
00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:07.195
Netter's edge. Runner's a runner.
Good stamina can take you far.

121
00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:40.061
<i>You don't fly your crip out cover
from now on. You fill me. doug?</i>

122
00:08:41.145 --> 00:08:44.899
Every single day you check. wallet.
cock sock in your damn iron.

123
00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:49.237
Sure. some punks strictly hack.
will go straight chrome.

124
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.989
But it will be a while
before you can keep your ass alive

125
00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:53.741
using just cyberware.

126
00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:59.038
Until that time comes.
this piece will be your backup plan.

127
00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:07.797
- So. hey.
- What now?

128
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.507
How old are you anyway?

129
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:36.993
How're things going on with Lucy?

130
00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:38.077
Huh?

131
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.245
Treating you right?

132
00:09:40.162 --> 00:09:43.165
Sorry. I didn't mean...
That cam out wrong.

133
00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:46.085
It's just. your age. your skills.
they don't add up.

134
00:09:46.168 --> 00:09:48.421
Blame Math were it ain't applicable.

135
00:09:48.504 --> 00:09:50.423
It's aptitude and hard work.

136
00:09:50.506 --> 00:09:54.176
So get that straight. Only gonks
talk on others based on age.

137
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.636
Gonks like?

138
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.597
Long-limb techies.

139
00:10:18.534 --> 00:10:19.827
Grr!

140
00:10:21.912 --> 00:10:24.248
<i>What do you mean by
"treating her right"?</i>

141
00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:27.168
Huh! It means
you haven't done nothing?

142
00:10:27.251 --> 00:10:29.045
What are we
talking about. exactly?

143
00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:32.798
David. my clueless junior.
You need a pro pair.

144
00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:36.844
And I think you know. I ain't just
talking about any edge right sense.

145
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.320
<i>Really? Thought I saw
you two hitting it off the other day.</i>

146
00:10:43.267 --> 00:10:45.895
Back at the black party.
post limo heist.

147
00:10:45.978 --> 00:10:49.815
He acts like a mentor sometimes
then turns around. gets grabby.

148
00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:53.819
And that night. so I fried him slightly
fucked-off real quickly after that.

149
00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:57.823
- And you?
- Me?

150
00:10:58.407 --> 00:11:00.660
You serious about headrunning?

151
00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.961
<i>I'm not into her like that.</i>

152
00:11:11.045 --> 00:11:13.464
Come on kid. we've all got eyes.

153
00:11:13.547 --> 00:11:17.593
Or. at least she's isn't
into me like that.

154
00:11:17.676 --> 00:11:19.345
Yeah. probably.

155
00:11:29.563 --> 00:11:30.689
Why do you ask?

156
00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:33.401
To be honest. just don't strike me
that type.

157
00:11:33.484 --> 00:11:34.985
What is that mean?

158
00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:36.320
Tell me!

159
00:11:48.457 --> 00:11:51.001
<i>I'm sick of trying
to figure it out. you know.</i>

160
00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:53.629
Meaning. what man?

161
00:11:53.712 --> 00:11:55.589
Said she wants to go to the moon.

162
00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:56.966
The damn moon?

163
00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:59.301
Yeah. I guess it's her dream or whatever.

164
00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:28.873
Turned out. you're a lot faster
than you look.

165
00:12:28.956 --> 00:12:30.624
Yeah. yeah.

166
00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:33.711
No. seriously.
Glad you could keep up with me.

167
00:12:33.794 --> 00:12:37.465
If that's suppose to be a pep talk.
no need. I don't go down. easy.

168
00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:18.464
<i>Never mentioned
nothing about that to me.</i>

169
00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:20.549
You're thinking she lied?

170
00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:22.968
Who knows? Just ask her.

171
00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:27.640
I mean. she was probably
just stalling me. but...

172
00:13:27.723 --> 00:13:32.186
Well. she took me to the moon.
with special BD she had.

173
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:34.063
You two went on a date
to the moon?

174
00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:38.567
Shit. doug! You don't get much more
romantic than that in Night City.

175
00:13:47.701 --> 00:13:49.453
<i>Here. a training regimen.</i>

176
00:13:50.287 --> 00:13:54.333
The bare minimum you should know.
No more hand holding after today.

177
00:13:55.042 --> 00:13:58.837
If you're serious about this. you're going
to push hard to keep up. And then...

178
00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:00.923
And then. what?

179
00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:23.862
<i>How long has she been running
for your crew?</i>

180
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:28.742
Uh. maybe a year.
Kiwi brought her in.

181
00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:31.996
Said she'd found a natural.
real cold feet.

182
00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:33.079
And before that?

183
00:14:33.122 --> 00:14:36.834
Like I said. ask her yourself
if you're interested. kid.

184
00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:39.378
I don't give two shits
about people's past.

185
00:14:39.461 --> 00:14:42.506
As long as they pull their weight
on the job. we're good.

186
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.508
That suits me just fine.

187
00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:09.450
Hey! Quiet down!

188
00:15:11.076 --> 00:15:13.203
Damn it!

189
00:15:15.205 --> 00:15:16.832
Why he's pissing up there?

190
00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:18.834
- Oh. mute!
- Gross!

191
00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:23.088
Uh! What's your problem. Chume?
Why are you pissing in the street. huh?

192
00:15:23.672 --> 00:15:25.841
Hey. man! Playing dumb?

193
00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.426
Leave him alone. Pilar.

194
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:30.189
- Bye. Bye. bro.
- You got to show us your stroke?

195
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.724
You hard in hearing. chuva?
I'm talking to you.

196
00:15:33.807 --> 00:15:37.311
Listen up. This isn't your water
in turf. asshole.

197
00:15:37.394 --> 00:15:39.730
And guess what.
we don't like pestering pissed.

198
00:15:39.813 --> 00:15:41.774
Are we clear on that?

199
00:15:41.857 --> 00:15:44.777
Now be a good asshole and pinch it off
and keep that pecker so we could...

200
00:15:44.818 --> 00:15:47.237
Oh. shit man! That's fucking plastic.

201
00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:49.674
You chromed your dick? That hurts.

202
00:15:49.698 --> 00:15:52.910
Kicks me to the face. Hard as...

203
00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:13.347
Hey...

204
00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:22.356
Da... vid...

205
00:16:24.441 --> 00:16:26.235
move...

206
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.385
Don't you freeze on me now!

207
00:16:51.468 --> 00:16:52.469
Fucking captive!

208
00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:54.753
- Enough Pilar on me...
- Give me that!

209
00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.016
Fucker!

210
00:16:57.099 --> 00:17:01.729
You had no fucking right!
You fucking cyber psycho.

211
00:17:04.398 --> 00:17:07.693
Crazy. little shit. Your flat now
if you won't subtle.

212
00:17:07.776 --> 00:17:09.486
Let me go!

213
00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:13.073
Hi-yah! Die!

214
00:17:17.786 --> 00:17:19.955
Shit. of all times...

215
00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.999
Kiwi! Press Becca's lullaby!

216
00:17:22.082 --> 00:17:23.917
On it.

217
00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:28.255
Where's Lucy?!

218
00:17:39.641 --> 00:17:41.477
Hey. asshole!

219
00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:44.855
David. no!

220
00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:02.998
You. okay?

221
00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:05.667
I'm fine.

222
00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:08.003
Alright. It's now over.

223
00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:11.006
You're bleeding...

224
00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:19.515
I'm the only bitch

225
00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:22.559
what's mine to kill.
You took that from me.

226
00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:28.941
Don't touch me.

227
00:18:29.024 --> 00:18:30.901
You're hurt? Need a booster?

228
00:18:30.984 --> 00:18:32.069
No. I'm good.

229
00:18:32.152 --> 00:18:35.572
Dorio. go and see Ripper. You should
take her to our buddy.

230
00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:39.868
Kiwi and I now hang back here. take care
of things 'till the pigs show to clean up.

231
00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:43.330
He's a pain in the ass. but someone
has to explain this cluster fuck.

232
00:18:43.413 --> 00:18:46.333
- Boss man has spoken.
- Hmm.

233
00:18:46.416 --> 00:18:49.878
- You too. kid. Stick with Lucy and Dorio.
- Huh?

234
00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:52.422
We'll tell the badges exactly
what went down.

235
00:18:52.506 --> 00:18:55.050
Fuck is chromed up to wazoo.
It will be easy.

236
00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:58.470
Minimal questions though filed
on this cyber psycho incident and done.

237
00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:01.348
- Yeah. but...
- I saw what you did back there. doug.

238
00:19:01.431 --> 00:19:03.976
It's hight time.
you stop thinking like a rookie.

239
00:19:06.311 --> 00:19:07.771
Not you again!

240
00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:10.357
You know. I'm not a licensed physician.

241
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.527
It doesn't matter. It's like I volunteered
to come here.

242
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:15.154
Sure. Whatever.

243
00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:17.281
I'm going alone.

244
00:19:17.364 --> 00:19:21.118
Make sure. you get her home
when she's clean. alright.

245
00:19:21.201 --> 00:19:23.681
- What! You're leaving.
- Maine said you could take his wheels.

246
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.004
Uh! Hey! Lucy.

247
00:19:42.306 --> 00:19:44.224
- Here's fine.
- Okay.

248
00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:46.727
- Good night.
- Um...

249
00:19:47.603 --> 00:19:50.397
Can we talk?

250
00:19:55.319 --> 00:19:56.319
This way.

251
00:20:00.324 --> 00:20:03.076
Aw. Cloudy tonight.

252
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.287
Remember that moon BD we did?

253
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.539
That was fun.

254
00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:15.339
I had something
I wanted to talk about. too.

255
00:20:15.422 --> 00:20:16.256
Huh?

256
00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.676
I know how it must look.
but. it's true

257
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.595
what I said then.

258
00:20:21.678 --> 00:20:24.223
It was actually the first time
I told anyone.

259
00:20:24.306 --> 00:20:27.559
Well. that's good. I like that.

260
00:20:27.643 --> 00:20:29.770
You know. the idea that you weren't lying.

261
00:20:30.354 --> 00:20:32.022
What if I'm lying now?

262
00:20:32.105 --> 00:20:34.274
- I seriously doubt it.
- Why not?

263
00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:37.027
- I just don't see it.
- Crazy.

264
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.655
You should've said something earlier
and spilled it right away.

265
00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:41.406
I couldn't.

266
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:42.407
What stopped you?

267
00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:44.660
You were so mad at me.

268
00:20:44.743 --> 00:20:46.036
I was not!

269
00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:48.038
Or too.

270
00:20:48.121 --> 00:20:52.292
I wasn't pissed off or anything.
It's just...

271
00:20:52.376 --> 00:20:53.603
- Well. yeah. I guess I kind of was
- See what I mean?

272
00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:57.547
So. okay. Maybe. I was angry.
but... it ain't like I'm holding a grudge.

273
00:20:59.633 --> 00:21:01.802
I wouldn't have jumped
that raging psycho if I wasn't.

274
00:21:01.885 --> 00:21:03.553
- Liar.
- I'm serious.

275
00:21:03.637 --> 00:21:04.680
No. you would have.

276
00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:08.308
You're the guy who jumps
in fire to rescue someone.

277
00:21:08.392 --> 00:21:12.104
anyone. even you know.
you're going to get burned.

278
00:21:12.187 --> 00:21:13.647
Just that type.

279
00:21:14.523 --> 00:21:17.317
Are we back to the you know mark thing?

280
00:21:17.401 --> 00:21:19.361
Maine thinks I got what it takes.

281
00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:22.030
- Why is it that you don't...
- No. it's not that.

282
00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:25.492
I know you'd make a good edgerunner.

283
00:21:25.575 --> 00:21:27.619
You already are. I think.

284
00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:29.162
So what's the problem?

285
00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:32.958
Don't make a name for yourself
as a cyberpunk by how you live...

286
00:21:33.542 --> 00:21:35.669
Make a name by how you die.

287
00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:40.090
It's not the life or the end you deserve.

288
00:21:40.173 --> 00:21:43.385
Was that even me?
How am I different from you?

289
00:21:43.468 --> 00:21:46.138
I've got nowhere else to go. This is it.

290
00:21:46.221 --> 00:21:47.448
And we're exactly the same.

291
00:21:47.472 --> 00:21:49.975
- You and I are worlds apart.
- In what way?

292
00:21:54.062 --> 00:21:56.262
I'm going to take you there myself.
fly you to the moon.

293
00:21:58.066 --> 00:21:59.526
That's a promise!

294
00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:11.496
I don't want you to die on me.

295
00:22:29.931 --> 00:22:30.931
I won't.
