175
00:10:47.855 --> 00:10:52.526
- [David] So. how did I do?
- I'd say you're well worth the 20%.

176
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.654
- Hey. it's 30!
- [giggles]

177
00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:56.113
- Kidding.
- [sighs]

178
00:10:56.822 --> 00:11:00.076
- Keep it rolling? Another car?
- A different line maybe?

179
00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:02.620
Somebody's probably
tipped the pigs off by now.

- [dizzying sounds]
- When we hop around. less chance...

181
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.751
[Lucy] How bad is he?

182
00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:10.378
[nurse] Typical rookie mistake.

183
00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:14.090
Hasn't taken any precautions
since the implant was installed.

184
00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:16.175
Which immunosuppressant is he on?

185
00:11:16.967 --> 00:11:18.511
Hey. this guy insured?

186
00:11:18.594 --> 00:11:21.847
Haven't got a clue.
For sure doesn't look like he would be.

187
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:25.601
[nurse] Any family. legal guardian?
Anyone I can call?

188
00:11:25.684 --> 00:11:28.562
[Lucy] Dunno. Parents. I guess.

189
00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:30.731
Used to go to Arasaka Academy.

190
00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:34.193
[nurse] Arasaka? [scoffs]
No wonder he could afford...

- Hey. Hold on a sec.
- [creaking sound]

192
00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:40.074
Morning. So. how are you feeling?

193
00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:42.410
I'm gonna hurl.

194
00:11:42.493 --> 00:11:44.245
[Lucy] Remember which pills you take?

195
00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:46.372
- [David] Pills?
- What?

196
00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:50.960

Listen. choom. this kid got an implant on
him that'll fetch at least a couple of K.

201
00:12:02.346 --> 00:12:05.057
- So. just sit back and relax and...
- [scoffs] Is that right?

202
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:07.268
You. like. cut a deal
with some Scavengers?

203
00:12:07.351 --> 00:12:10.020
I said sit back and chill
or we'll probe you for chrome too.

204
00:12:10.104 --> 00:12:11.605
Sorry. David.

205
00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:14.775
Looks like we gotta change our plans.
You're back to 20.

gonna scramble ya brain.

You're saying a single implant
could make me a cyberpsycho?

Never heard of that happenin' before.

Well. then I guess
that's a wrap for today.

I'm good. I can keep running.

275
00:15:56.455 --> 00:15:57.581

308
00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:18.662
[David] Like that kinda gunk poster.

309
00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:21.205
Got a problem?

310
00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:23.584
- [somber music]
- Uh... No problem.

311
00:17:23.667 --> 00:17:25.544
Just always whacked me out.

312
00:17:25.627 --> 00:17:29.965
All of those ads makin' it seem like
it's some kind of paradise or something.

313
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:33.427
Lots of peeps died tryin' to turn
that dumb rock into something useful.

314
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:36.180
More like a prison camp than a paradise.
if you ask me.

315
00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:40.142
[Lucy] Sounds to me like someone
did their homework.

316
00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:44.146
[David] Uh. not really.
Just a bunch of shit I learned in school.

317
00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:46.899
[Lucy] Begging your pardon. prep boy.

318
00:17:47.566 --> 00:17:49.276
[David] It ain't like that.

319
00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:52.321
[Lucy] Isn't it? Never met a pleb
who attended a 'Saka school.

320
00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:53.404
It's not!

321
00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:57.493
[gasps]

322
00:17:57.576 --> 00:18:00.579
My. uh. my mom and I
weren't very well off.

323
00:18:00.662 --> 00:18:03.342
There's no way they would have
accepted me off the street like that.

324
00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:06.460
She worked damn hard to keep me
in the Academy.

325
00:18:06.543 --> 00:18:09.421
scraping together eddies
anyways she could.

326
00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:11.465
You wanna know the real kicker though?

327
00:18:11.548 --> 00:18:14.093
I knew from day 1 I'd never belong there.

328
00:18:14.176 --> 00:18:17.513
[Lucy] So why stick around for so long?
Or at all.

329
00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:19.098
[David] Good fuckin' question.

330
00:18:19.181 --> 00:18:21.141
Guess it was for Mom. You know.

331
00:18:21.225 --> 00:18:24.478
"You'll get a job at Arasaka.
climb the corpo ladder."

332
00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:29.817
Was kinda her dream. all that 'Saka stuff.
Our dream. I guess.

333
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.068
Or whatever.

334
00:18:32.319 --> 00:18:35.739
- It's not your dream. though. is it?
- My dream?

335
00:18:36.323 --> 00:18:39.243
Well. yeah. You. your mom.
you're different people.

336
00:18:40.077 --> 00:18:42.579
Why should you work to achieve her dream?

337
00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:45.749
Actually. there's nothing wrong with that.

338
00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:48.627
[Lucy] You need to find your own dream.

339
