(screaming) Call an ambulance!

00:00:04.706 --> 00:00:06.074
You know her?

3
00:00:06.107 --> 00:00:08.309
She's one of the girls I killed.

4
00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:10.812
No...

5
00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:12.446
(moaning)

6
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.916
I'm giving you one
more shot. Teddy.

7
00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:17.618
You go to your father's
and look him in the eye.

8
00:00:17.652 --> 00:00:19.954
You fuck this up. and
I'm gonna kill you.

wouldn't do for you.

I'm only taking two.

Well. I've got four.

14
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.272
The Volpes already
got enough coke.

Told y'all I got a cousin
named Devon up in Oakland.

19
00:00:48.082 --> 00:00:50.885
Think I could take the
car for a few hours?

What would you have done?

111
00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:06.634
Let the cops find 50 keys
and a dead CIA officer?

112
00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:08.136
No. see. I would've
told the truth

113
00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.304
when the next CIA officer
asked me about it

114
00:06:10.338 --> 00:06:13.541
instead of insisting that
he was paranoid and crazy.

115
00:06:13.574 --> 00:06:16.014
I didn't know you. Couldn't risk
poisoning the well like that.

Yeah. no. I'm here. Go ahead.

Okay.

121
00:06:30.391 --> 00:06:32.226
They trace the number?

122
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.828
Yeah. the number's registered
to Kristin's apartment.

123
00:06:34.862 --> 00:06:37.065
She mention a roommate
or boyfriend or...

124
00:06:37.098 --> 00:06:40.301
No. but. uh. boyfriend
is unlikely.

You want to get that?
(bottle clatters)

145
00:07:43.664 --> 00:07:46.200
She's working as a paralegal.
Hello. I'm not in right now.

146
00:07:46.234 --> 00:07:48.212
Please leave your message after the beep.
Best I can tell...

147
00:07:48.236 --> 00:07:50.916
(machine beeps) after maybe a week
of not hearing from her sister...

148
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.985
JULIA: Hey. it's me. I just wanted to
say hi. she decides to get in the car

149
00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:55.075
and drive out here... look
forward to seeing you...

150
00:07:55.109 --> 00:07:58.379
So we need to figure out
what else she knows.

151
00:07:58.412 --> 00:08:00.414
(scoffs)

152
00:08:00.448 --> 00:08:02.783
She's a grad student.
What can she do?

153
00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.618
TEDDY: Exactly what
she's been doing.

154
00:08:04.652 --> 00:08:06.654
She can ask around. she
can make some noise.

155
00:08:06.687 --> 00:08:08.256
She can go to the police.

156
00:08:08.289 --> 00:08:10.049
So I. for one. will sleep
much better knowing

157
00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:12.293
that she's not
gotten any traction.

158
00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:14.328
I imagine probably
you will. too.

159
00:08:17.131 --> 00:08:21.835
And there is. uh. one more thing
I need to talk to you about.

160
00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:25.339
ALEJANDRO: (sighs)
Okay. what's that?

161
00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:29.343
TEDDY: The bodies.

162
00:08:29.377 --> 00:08:32.246
You didn't just dump 'em
in the canyon. did you?

163
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.349
No. I took them all out
of town. buried them.

164
00:08:35.383 --> 00:08:37.251
TEDDY: Where?

00:25:26.993 --> 00:25:29.296
This room...

492
00:25:29.329 --> 00:25:31.864
is a door life.

493
00:25:31.898 --> 00:25:36.203
Is... is life. is all doors.

494
00:25:36.236 --> 00:25:40.807
They're just... you know. they're just...
just opening.

495
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.276
Yeah. Opening...

496
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:45.111
You on your way to
space. for sure.

497
00:25:45.144 --> 00:25:48.147
(sighs) Opening.

498
00:25:48.181 --> 00:25:50.283
I wanna see what it is.
Go get some more. huh?

499
00:25:50.317 --> 00:25:52.885
(exhales) Oh... I'll buy it.

500
00:25:56.689 --> 00:25:58.391
Oh.

501
00:26:00.059 --> 00:26:02.495
(exhales) I like you. Star.

502
00:26:02.529 --> 00:26:04.864
I like you. too.

503
00:26:04.897 --> 00:26:07.234

(laughs)

507
00:26:16.743 --> 00:26:18.311
(laughs)

508
00:26:18.345 --> 00:26:20.385
Well. you're not about to
walk around here barefoot?

509
00:26:20.409 --> 00:26:22.148
Why not? It feels...
It feels good.

510
00:26:22.181 --> 00:26:25.017
Well. you're gonna mess
those pretty feet up.

511
00:26:25.051 --> 00:26:27.520
You think they're pretty?

512
00:26:27.554 --> 00:26:29.188
You know you got beautiful feet.

513
00:26:29.222 --> 00:26:31.491
(chuckles) Thank you. Star.

514
00:26:31.524 --> 00:26:33.260
Get that quarter piece. man.

515
00:26:33.293 --> 00:26:35.027
Smoke this right now. brother.

516
00:26:35.061 --> 00:26:37.141
Hey. don't even think about
firing that shit up here.

517
00:26:37.165 --> 00:26:38.665
Move your ass along.

518
00:26:38.698 --> 00:26:40.433
All right. All right. all right.

519
00:26:40.467 --> 00:26:41.834
(train passing)

520
00:26:41.868 --> 00:26:43.703
- What you need. man?
- What's up?

521
00:26:43.736 --> 00:26:45.071
Hey. there. girly girl.

522
00:26:45.104 --> 00:26:47.507
Back already with
them pretty-ass toes?

523
00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.609
(laughter)

524
00:26:49.642 --> 00:26:51.010
You got $20?

525
00:26:51.043 --> 00:26:52.879
Uh. $20? Uh. yeah. Mm-hmm.

526
00:26:52.912 --> 00:26:54.847
(chuckling) Uh...$20.

527
00:26:54.881 --> 00:26:56.082
Mm.

528
00:26:56.115 --> 00:26:58.117
(vehicle arrives)

529
00:27:00.953 --> 00:27:04.791
Okay. come on. Let's go.

530
00:27:04.824 --> 00:27:06.926
Uh. actually. I can't right now.

531
00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:09.228
Oh. no... Why don't you go
back to the special place

532
00:27:09.262 --> 00:27:13.466
and maybe I'll see you later?
Huh? (Laughs) Okay.

533
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.569
Bye. Franklin. (laughs)

534
00:27:16.603 --> 00:27:21.207
Mm-hmm. You probably right. yeah.
She fine. but she crazy.

535
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.943
(laughter)

536
00:27:23.976 --> 00:27:25.978
How long's that gonna last her?

537
00:27:26.012 --> 00:27:28.412
I don't know. She'll probably
be back tonight. And it's coke?

538
00:27:28.436 --> 00:27:30.617
Rocked up. yeah.

539
00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.785
Why is it so cheap? I
ain't no cook. nigga.

540
00:27:32.819 --> 00:27:35.355
I just move the shit.

541
00:27:38.991 --> 00:27:41.193
I'll buy everything you got.

542
00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:46.232
If you show me who cooked it.

543
00:27:46.265 --> 00:27:49.268
Crossin' a line now. blood.

544
00:27:55.775 --> 00:27:57.710
I ain't got no piece. man.

545
00:28:02.515 --> 00:28:06.118
(humming)

546
00:28:10.557 --> 00:28:13.125
Country motherfucker. What
the fuck are you doing?

547
00:28:13.159 --> 00:28:15.294
No tricks. no games. man.

548
00:28:15.328 --> 00:28:18.831
I just wanna know how y'all
make what y'all making.

549
00:28:18.865 --> 00:28:20.900
(dog barking in distance)

550
00:28:22.369 --> 00:28:24.904
Nice shoes.

551
00:28:36.015 --> 00:28:37.717
You wanna meet the Wizard?

552
00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:40.553
Hell. yeah.

553
00:28:42.689 --> 00:28:44.691
All right. hold down the spot.

554
00:28:44.724 --> 00:28:47.827
Wait. You seriously
gonna take him to Swim?

555
00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:51.330
This nigga got two keys of coke on him.
Hell. yeah.

556
00:28:51.364 --> 00:28:54.033
Let's go. Dorothy.

557
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:05.978
(sighs)

558
00:29:06.012 --> 00:29:09.749
Oh. watch your shit.
That's mud right there.

559
00:29:09.782 --> 00:29:11.518
(laughs)

560
00:29:11.551 --> 00:29:13.920
- Good looking out.
- Yeah. yeah.

561
00:29:13.953 --> 00:29:15.588
(sighs)

562
00:29:17.424 --> 00:29:21.528

(lock clicks. gate creaks open)

564
00:29:26.633 --> 00:29:28.200
Go ahead.

565
00:29:28.234 --> 00:29:29.702
Come on. man.

566
00:29:34.441 --> 00:29:37.009
(hitting key)

567
00:29:37.043 --> 00:29:38.911
Where the fucking E key?

568
00:29:38.945 --> 00:29:40.179
(key playing)

569
00:29:40.212 --> 00:29:42.749
Hey. man. He cool.

570
00:29:42.782 --> 00:29:44.116
He from L.A.

571
00:29:45.618 --> 00:29:47.386
Oh. why you didn't say
that at first. man?

572
00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:50.056
He from L.A.?

573
00:29:50.089 --> 00:29:51.624
So who are you. Michael Jackson?

574
00:29:52.892 --> 00:29:54.927
No. this nigga too dark
to be Michael Jackson.

575
00:29:54.961 --> 00:29:57.530
He more like Sidney Poitier.

576
00:29:57.564 --> 00:29:59.131
No.

577
00:29:59.165 --> 00:30:01.067
I don't know why this
Bobby Womack-ass nigga

578
00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.135
brought you here to
my place of business

579
00:30:03.169 --> 00:30:04.780
when he should have had his
ass out there working.

580
00:30:04.804 --> 00:30:06.939
Look. Swim. This nigga
right here cleaned me out

581
00:30:06.973 --> 00:30:08.608
just so he can meet you.

582
00:30:08.641 --> 00:30:10.076
And you see what he packin'.

583
00:30:10.109 --> 00:30:11.644
Nigga. you stupid right now.

584
00:30:11.678 --> 00:30:13.746
It's my fault. I asked.

585
00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.815
I just wanna know how y'all
make what y'all makin'.

586
00:30:17.617 --> 00:30:20.587
(Playing notes on
piano. keys tuning)

587
00:30:24.123 --> 00:30:25.958
Go on.

588
00:30:25.992 --> 00:30:27.293
(piano continues tuning)

589
00:30:27.326 --> 00:30:28.728
Go knock that shit off.

590
00:30:28.761 --> 00:30:30.401
and don't come back
till you're done. boy.

591
00:30:30.425 --> 00:30:32.398
(door opens. closes)

592
00:30:32.431 --> 00:30:34.467
What's your name?

593
00:30:34.501 --> 00:30:36.302
Franklin.

594
00:30:36.335 --> 00:30:39.171
They call me Swim. 'cause I'm
either swimming in some money

595
00:30:39.205 --> 00:30:41.474
or swimming in some pussy.

596
00:30:41.508 --> 00:30:44.811
(door opens. closes)

597
00:30:49.816 --> 00:30:51.518
Shit don't make no sense. man.

598
00:30:51.551 --> 00:30:53.019
I agree.

599
00:30:53.052 --> 00:30:55.087
Either you make it
make sense to me.

600
00:30:55.121 --> 00:30:57.323
or I just gotta simplify.

601
00:30:57.356 --> 00:30:59.759
And you know what I mean. right?

602
00:30:59.792 --> 00:31:04.263
I can't tell you if my luck's
been running good or bad. man.

603
00:31:04.296 --> 00:31:09.001
But y'all doing something here
and I'm trying to get in on.

604
00:31:09.035 --> 00:31:12.371
Now. I might be taking
a leap of faith.

605
00:31:12.404 --> 00:31:15.975
Shit. I might be dumb as fuck.

606
00:31:16.008 --> 00:31:18.778
But this shot. this shot.

607
00:31:18.811 --> 00:31:21.180
it feels like it's worth takin'.

608
00:31:23.215 --> 00:31:26.118
'Cause I got things I gotta do.

609
00:31:26.152 --> 00:31:28.855
Things I want.

610
00:31:30.322 --> 00:31:32.024
You understand what I'm sayin'?

611
00:31:39.866 --> 00:31:42.669
If you're the man
cookin' this up.

612
00:31:42.702 --> 00:31:46.505
it means you an artist.

613
00:31:46.539 --> 00:31:50.176
In my experience.
artists create.

614
00:31:50.209 --> 00:31:54.313
and they want the whole
world to experience it.

615
00:31:54.346 --> 00:31:56.816
You an artist. Swim?

616
00:31:56.849 --> 00:31:59.218
Maybe.

617
00:31:59.251 --> 00:32:02.922
So teach me. Show me how
to create the way you do.

618
00:32:02.955 --> 00:32:06.525
I'll take it back to L.A.
and I'll spread the word.

619
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:11.931
(scoffs)

Angelico.

626
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.603
We're gonna cook up one
more batch tonight.

627
00:32:53.305 --> 00:32:56.542
SWIM: Keep up now. We
gonna go fast. you dig?

628
00:32:56.575 --> 00:32:59.478
So these Peruvians. right.
when they make they cocaine.

629
00:32:59.511 --> 00:33:01.648
they got this paste.

630
00:33:01.681 --> 00:33:04.483
This cocaine paste at the
bottom of their barrel.

631
00:33:04.516 --> 00:33:08.120
They call it
"bah-say." Nasty shit.

632
00:33:08.154 --> 00:33:11.157
But you take this "bah-say."
you roll it into a cigarette.

633
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:13.159
that shit gets you
fucked up. Jack.

634
00:33:13.192 --> 00:33:17.396
I had some of my boys who flew
down to Peru for a weekend.

635
00:33:17.429 --> 00:33:20.566
(flames whoosh) They chasing pussy
and whatnot. getting some sunshine.

636
00:33:20.599 --> 00:33:22.434
They smoke this bah-say
with some bitches

637
00:33:22.468 --> 00:33:24.737
and they love it.
Bitches love it. too.

638
00:33:24.771 --> 00:33:26.505
And they keep hearin' it.

639
00:33:26.538 --> 00:33:28.908
Bah-say. bah-say.
bah-say. bah-say.

640
00:33:28.941 --> 00:33:30.309
It keeps going in their head.

641
00:33:30.342 --> 00:33:32.611
Bah-say. bahss. bahss.
bahss. bahss. bahss.

642
00:33:32.645 --> 00:33:33.946
Base.

643
00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:36.082
Come back to the Bay Area

644
00:33:36.115 --> 00:33:38.851
thinkin' that bah-say was
more than what it was.

645
00:33:38.885 --> 00:33:41.921
Pull out their chemistry sets.
try to figure out a way

646
00:33:41.954 --> 00:33:44.590
to free the base
from the cocaine.

647
00:33:44.623 --> 00:33:46.623
They didn't even know what
the fuck they was doing.

648
00:33:46.647 --> 00:33:49.528
but next thing you know. they
unlocked some whole new shit.

649
00:33:49.561 --> 00:33:51.931
And like many other
inventions in America.

650
00:33:51.964 --> 00:33:53.966
it was just a big.
beautiful mistake.

651
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.369
Now crack is the same thing.
but it's cheaper. simpler.

652
00:33:57.403 --> 00:33:59.171
and safer to make.

653
00:33:59.205 --> 00:34:02.008
We don't fuck with no ether
no more. do we. Angel?

654
00:34:02.041 --> 00:34:05.344
Nah. ether do what
ether wanna do.

655
00:34:05.377 --> 00:34:07.546
FRANKLIN: Those the
only ingredients?

656
00:34:07.579 --> 00:34:09.849
It's like bacon and
eggs. Bert and Ernie.

657
00:34:09.882 --> 00:34:12.202
Sometime it only take two things
that complement each other

658
00:34:12.226 --> 00:34:14.453
to make something great.
Peas and carrots.

659
00:34:14.486 --> 00:34:17.223
SWIM: (chuckles) Peas
and fucking carrots.

660
00:34:18.925 --> 00:34:20.727
Now here's the tricky part.

661
00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.529
Yeah. You see that?

662
00:34:23.562 --> 00:34:26.899
See those rocks? They're
starting to swim like tadpoles.

663
00:34:26.933 --> 00:34:30.336
(rocks clinking) Can I get high
from breathing these fumes in?

664
00:34:30.369 --> 00:34:33.239
You get a contact. but
you won't get high.

665
00:34:33.272 --> 00:34:35.641
You wanna hit this
shit when we done?

666
00:34:35.674 --> 00:34:38.210
Nah. I don't use.

667
00:34:38.244 --> 00:34:39.979
You should consider
it. my nigga.

668
00:34:40.012 --> 00:34:42.048
That shit open up dark
places in your brain.

669
00:34:42.081 --> 00:34:43.883
these places ain't
never been touched.

670
00:34:43.916 --> 00:34:47.053
Deep. dark places.

671
00:34:47.086 --> 00:34:49.856
Light you up like
you never been lit.

672
00:34:53.392 --> 00:34:56.095
Now here we go. Like the Earth.

673
00:34:56.128 --> 00:35:00.266
she cools down
until she hardens.

674
00:35:00.299 --> 00:35:02.368
(crunching)

675
00:35:02.401 --> 00:35:06.038
Thus creation is born.

676
00:35:06.072 --> 00:35:08.040
You get $50 for this rock. man.

677

681
00:35:16.082 --> 00:35:18.717
SWIM: Shit. How much more?

682
00:35:18.751 --> 00:35:20.219

WOMAN: And you're
sure about that?

686
00:35:36.803 --> 00:35:38.971
Was anyone there to pick her up?

All right.

(clears throat) Hi. hi.

695
00:36:00.526 --> 00:36:02.137
Can I just talk to you for just one sec?
(telephone rings)

696
00:36:02.161 --> 00:36:04.081
I just need one sec. It's
about a missing person.

Please. I just need to talk to you.
I'm trying...

698
00:36:06.165 --> 00:36:08.767
I'm trying to find my friend.
She's a missing person.

699
00:36:08.801 --> 00:36:10.669
Her name is Jess Avon.
Please. I know...

700
00:36:10.702 --> 00:36:12.471
I can see that you
are busy here...

701
00:36:12.504 --> 00:36:14.504
Sir. can you please keep
calm and lower your voice?

702
00:36:14.528 --> 00:36:17.431
- We'll get to you when we can.
- Unbelievable.

703
00:36:18.677 --> 00:36:21.080
Excuse me.

704
00:36:21.113 --> 00:36:23.115
(sighs) Sorry. I didn't
mean to bother you.

705
00:36:23.149 --> 00:36:25.317
But did... did you say
that your friend's name

706
00:36:25.351 --> 00:36:28.587
was Jess Avon?

707
00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.089
Uh. yeah.

708
00:36:30.122 --> 00:36:31.357
Why? You know her?

709
00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:34.426
No. um. I know of her.

710
00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.362
Can we talk for a minute?

711

715
00:36:44.871 --> 00:36:46.372
Hi. Um...

716

Ay!

720
00:37:03.389 --> 00:37:06.492
Someday soon it's gonna be foot
soldiers doing all the runs

721
00:37:06.525 --> 00:37:08.294
instead of rancheros.

722

Even though seem to think
nothing's changing.

723
00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:14.233
Too much up for grabs.

724
00:37:14.266 --> 00:37:16.468
These bastards are changing
the tempo of the whole thing

725
00:37:16.502 --> 00:37:18.570
and from prison.

726
00:37:18.604 --> 00:37:21.507
Shit. They're gonna
redraw the whole map.

727
00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.842
That's what they're gonna do.

728
00:37:23.876 --> 00:37:27.713
Being boss? Always
looking ahead.

730
00:37:31.884 --> 00:37:34.520
Yeah? What can you see?

731
00:37:44.263 --> 00:37:45.764
What's up with you?

732
00:37:48.734 --> 00:37:50.036
Nothing.

733
00:37:51.637 --> 00:37:56.042
Listen. the other night
at the party. um.

734
00:37:56.075 --> 00:37:59.311
that's a nice thing you said.

735
00:38:00.947 --> 00:38:02.881
Sorry I got on your
case. you know.

736

Did he ever. Fuck
is wrong with you?

746
00:38:46.758 --> 00:38:49.795
Devon was mad as hell. man.
You almost got me killed.

747
00:38:49.828 --> 00:38:51.630
Shit would've been
better. though.

748
00:38:51.663 --> 00:38:52.999
I'm never drinking again.

749
00:38:53.032 --> 00:38:54.800
My bad. man. Sorry I left.

750
00:38:54.833 --> 00:38:57.603
Just had to leave. man.
Get my mind right.

751
00:38:57.636 --> 00:39:00.639
- All night?
- Got caught up.

752
00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:02.774
(scoffs)

753
00:39:02.808 --> 00:39:04.676
Come on. man. Open the door.
Shit.

754
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:07.513
- Shotgun.
- Man. shotgun.

755
00:39:07.546 --> 00:39:10.316
Hey. we hit 7-Eleven
before we hit the highway?

756
00:39:10.349 --> 00:39:12.851
Oh. yeah. Sure. baby. You know.

757
00:39:12.884 --> 00:39:15.165
(unzips bag) Soon as Franklin
tell us why he blew the deal

758
00:39:15.189 --> 00:39:17.289
we drove all the way
the fuck out here for.

759
00:39:17.323 --> 00:39:20.192
And why he got me kicked
out my own cousin's spot.

760
00:39:20.226 --> 00:39:21.666
And where the hell
he been all night.

761
00:39:21.693 --> 00:39:24.196
Then we can go to
7-Eleven. Leon.
