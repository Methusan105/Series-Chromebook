Call an ambulance!

00:00:03.354 --> 00:00:05.490
Now you see why I didn't
call an ambulance.

00:00:10.128 --> 00:00:12.488
You show up and start asking
questions. they'll get nervous.

6
00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:14.432
You said that there was
no one here besides you

That's right.

you should show up at all.

Safe from what?

97
