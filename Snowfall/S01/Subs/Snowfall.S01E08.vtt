You know her?

00:00:03.137 --> 00:00:05.573
She's one of the girls I killed.

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:06.886
TEDDY: Whoever's
looking for her.

4
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.409
we need to figure
out who that is.

We partied one night.

146

chick there as well.

Okay. can...

Don't quite remember the name.

I might be able to
remember better

if my tourist visa
wasn't expiring.

Wait. what?

153
00:06:08.502 --> 00:06:10.804
Money to hire a lawyer.

154
00:06:10.838 --> 00:06:14.542
That would almost
certainly jog my memory.

155

(sips)

157

She had a dimple on her chin.

158
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.453
and she did a mean Bonnie Tyler.

159
00:06:25.486 --> 00:06:27.821
just in case you think
I'm not for real.

160
00:06:27.855 --> 00:06:30.824
Wait. But...

161
00:06:30.858 --> 00:06:34.128

lives on the line?

645
00:30:13.913 --> 00:30:15.748
I almost died twice since
I started this shit.

646
00:30:15.782 --> 00:30:17.249
Man. this nigga full of excuses.

647
00:30:17.283 --> 00:30:19.283
but you ain't nothing but
a cheap ass motherfucker.

648
00:30:19.307 --> 00:30:21.821
(laughs) You get poked one
time by some junkie ass blade.

649
00:30:21.854 --> 00:30:25.157
What about me? I've been
robbed. beat. shot at.

650
00:30:25.191 --> 00:30:26.626
You wanna talk about hazard pay.

651
00:30:26.659 --> 00:30:28.227
where's my hazard
pay. motherfucker?

652
00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.896
You know what? Fine.

653
00:30:29.929 --> 00:30:32.799
You want money? Here.
take some money.

654
00:30:32.832 --> 00:30:34.810
Man. who done all the fucking
killing for you. man?

655
00:30:34.834 --> 00:30:37.115
Step the fuck back. But now
you're some king or some shit?

656
00:30:37.148 --> 00:30:39.068
You gonna tell me how to
wipe my own fucking ass?

657
00:30:39.102 --> 00:30:40.491
I said step the fuck back! Hey.

658
00:30:40.524 --> 00:30:41.974
(sighs)

659
00:30:42.008 --> 00:30:43.810

660
00:30:43.843 --> 00:30:45.812
Hey. man. What are

661
00:30:45.845 --> 00:30:47.279
Hey. hey! Come on. man.
(grunting)

662
00:30:47.313 --> 00:30:49.233
Give me what you owe me.

663
00:30:49.257 --> 00:30:51.317
Get the fuck off me. you
jailbird motherfucker!

664
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:54.286
Hey. hey. hey... Fuck you.
bougie-ass motherfucker!

665
00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.856

666

670
00:31:07.867 --> 00:31:11.103

676
00:31:25.417 --> 00:31:26.653

678
00:31:38.565 --> 00:31:40.567
TEDDY: Quiet neighborhood.

680
00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:46.573
(breathing heavily)

681
00:31:48.575 --> 00:31:50.376
VICTORIA: Just do...

682
00:31:51.343 --> 00:31:53.546
Dang it. (dials call box. beep)

683
00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:56.215
Hello? Is anyone there?

684
00:31:56.248 --> 00:31:57.516
(call box squawks)

685
00:32:02.755 --> 00:32:04.891
Hello?! Whoa. whoa. hey.

686
00:32:04.924 --> 00:32:06.292
What?

687
00:32:06.926 --> 00:32:09.662
Okay. um...

688
00:32:09.696 --> 00:32:11.430
Great. (grunts)

689
00:32:11.463 --> 00:32:12.932
Now we're trespassing.

690
00:32:12.965 --> 00:32:14.934
It's okay. Well.
then. don't come.

691
00:32:14.967 --> 00:32:18.537
Oh. no. no. getting shot would
be the perfect end to this day.

692
00:32:18.571 --> 00:32:20.773
Hope they don't have a dog.
(lights click on)

693
00:32:20.807 --> 00:32:22.609
Excuse me?

694
00:32:22.642 --> 00:32:24.210
What do you think you're doing?

695
00:32:24.243 --> 00:32:27.013
Oh. sorry. Hey.
this is your house?

696
00:32:27.046 --> 00:32:29.515
Yes. and it's private property.

697
00:32:29.548 --> 00:32:33.686
I'm sorry. Uh. all
right. this is...

698
00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.022
I'm looking for someone...
My sister.

699
00:32:36.055 --> 00:32:38.925
She went missing a couple weeks
ago and somebody told me

700
00:32:38.958 --> 00:32:40.860
that she went to a
party at this house

701
00:32:40.893 --> 00:32:42.762
the last night that
anyone saw her.

702
00:32:42.795 --> 00:32:44.864
A party here?

703
00:32:44.897 --> 00:32:47.399
The only kind of parties we
throw come with birthday hats

704
00:32:47.433 --> 00:32:50.069
and kids under 9.

705
00:32:50.102 --> 00:32:52.304
I have a photograph.

706
00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:57.543
Do you... Do you recognize her?

707
00:32:57.576 --> 00:33:01.313
No. And as sorry as I am
to hear about your sister.

708
00:33:01.347 --> 00:33:04.917
I want you to leave. or
I'm calling the police.

709
00:33:04.951 --> 00:33:06.485
Yeah. okay. Hey...

710
00:33:06.518 --> 00:33:08.621
Of course.

711
00:33:08.655 --> 00:33:11.624
Sorry for bothering you.

712
00:33:11.658 --> 00:33:13.960
So. look. if you
remember anything else.

713
00:33:13.993 --> 00:33:15.327
my name's Reed Thompson.

714
00:33:15.361 --> 00:33:18.164
It's in the book. Of course. Mr.
Thompson.

715
00:33:18.197 --> 00:33:20.266
(whispers) The
robe's a nice touch.

716
00:33:21.634 --> 00:33:23.502
(normal voice) Thank
you for your help.

717
00:33:28.941 --> 00:33:32.544
(crying)

718
00:33:40.286 --> 00:33:43.122
(exhales) I miss her so much.

719
00:33:43.155 --> 00:33:45.658
(exhales)

720
00:33:45.692 --> 00:33:47.994
(cries)

721
00:33:48.027 --> 00:33:49.929
Trapeze class? I mean.
what was she gonna do?

722
00:33:49.962 --> 00:33:52.999
Run off and join
Barnum & Bailey?

723
00:33:55.001 --> 00:33:56.602
(sniffles)

724
00:33:56.635 --> 00:33:59.638
I don't know. I guess I just
didn't know her anymore.

725
00:34:02.508 --> 00:34:05.211
(crying)

726
00:34:08.647 --> 00:34:10.382
(sobbing)

727
00:34:21.227 --> 00:34:22.494
- (humming)
- You all right?

728
00:34:22.528 --> 00:34:24.130
Mnh-mnh.

729
00:34:24.163 --> 00:34:27.133
Uh. nah. man.

730
00:34:27.166 --> 00:34:30.669
Our world ain't on
fire anymore. huh?

731
00:34:30.703 --> 00:34:33.672
Feel like a tiny animal
gnawing at my brain. man.

732
00:34:33.706 --> 00:34:36.375
Yeah. probably best to leave
that out the sales pitch.

733
00:34:36.408 --> 00:34:39.411
Yeah. you right. (baby
crying in distance)

734
00:34:39.445 --> 00:34:42.181
Heard from Leon?

735
00:34:42.214 --> 00:34:44.650
No.

736
00:34:44.683 --> 00:34:46.652
No worries. He'll come around.

737
00:34:46.685 --> 00:34:49.822
Man. come on. He always do.

738
00:34:49.856 --> 00:34:53.760
Like that time you bought the
same exact shirt as him.

739
00:34:53.793 --> 00:34:56.996
He always come back and eat pie
at the end of the day. right?

740
00:34:57.029 --> 00:35:00.266
(speaking indistinctly)
FRANKLIN: Eat pie?

741
00:35:00.299 --> 00:35:06.072
(men shouting indistinctly) Yeah. you
know. like. eat pie. Humble pie. Humble.

742
00:35:06.105 --> 00:35:07.706
(cheering)

743
00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:09.340
Oh. you wouldn't know
nothin' about that.

744
00:35:09.364 --> 00:35:10.509
(laughs)

745
00:35:10.542 --> 00:35:13.946
(basketball dribbling.
shouting continues)

746
00:35:21.087 --> 00:35:23.122
You think they here for us?

747
00:35:24.456 --> 00:35:27.960
(chuckles) Yes. they are.

748
00:35:27.994 --> 00:35:29.528
MAN: Come on. man!

749
00:35:29.561 --> 00:35:31.898
Breakfast time.
ladies and gentlemen.

750
00:35:31.931 --> 00:35:34.166
Who's first?

751
00:35:35.734 --> 00:35:38.304
(speaking Spanish)

752
00:35:48.647 --> 00:35:50.416
You fucking piece of shit!

753
00:35:50.449 --> 00:35:52.451
(object thuds)

754
00:35:52.484 --> 00:35:56.355
You have the balls to come in
here after running to Daddy?

755
00:36:01.794 --> 00:36:03.529
Look at this place.

756
00:36:08.334 --> 00:36:11.703
You two have really put
your work in. huh?

757
00:36:15.641 --> 00:36:19.545
I'm not sure that this is how I
would've done it. but. uh...

758
00:36:23.049 --> 00:36:24.783
Looks good.

759
00:36:27.053 --> 00:36:29.321
Anyone else here?

760
00:36:31.657 --> 00:36:33.059
Gustavo?

761
00:36:35.161 --> 00:36:37.196
I don't know where he is.

762
00:36:40.232 --> 00:36:42.701
You tell him about
our discussion?

763
00:36:47.573 --> 00:36:49.675
'Cause if I find out you
lied to me again...

764
00:36:49.708 --> 00:36:51.577
He doesn't know anything.

765
00:36:53.579 --> 00:36:55.014
Good.

766
00:36:59.318 --> 00:37:02.354
Let's go here and.

Hey. my nigga. My bad about

775
00:37:48.067 --> 00:37:50.769
Let's squash all this.

Mnh-mnh. That ain't cool.
You know I good for it.

781
00:38:04.716 --> 00:38:06.836
It's 10 or nothing. sweetheart.
I don't make the rule.

782
00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.554
Get you free Frosties for life.

783
00:38:08.587 --> 00:38:10.189
Frosties?

784
00:38:10.222 --> 00:38:13.259
Do you think I got this body
tossing back milkshakes. huh?

785
00:38:13.292 --> 00:38:14.927
Finish what you got. man.

Walk away. Mama.
