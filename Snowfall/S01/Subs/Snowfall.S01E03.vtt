Of course. You're not busy?

No. nothing that can't wait.

487
00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:09.393
This... it... it's not even
gonna come back to the agency.

488
00:24:09.417 --> 00:24:11.519
It's not just the agency
I'm worried about.

489
00:24:11.552 --> 00:24:14.388
Okay. it's not gonna
come back to me either.

490
00:24:14.422 --> 00:24:17.591
It's not just you
I'm worried about.

491
00:24:21.795 --> 00:24:23.764
Okay. let's just
say for a moment

492
00:24:23.797 --> 00:24:27.101
this is even possible.

493
00:24:27.135 --> 00:24:29.375
Have you considered what running
something this dangerous

494
00:24:29.399 --> 00:24:30.471
will do to you?

495
00:24:30.504 --> 00:24:32.740
Mentally.

496
00:24:35.409 --> 00:24:37.545
Come on. that...

497
00:24:37.578 --> 00:24:38.712
I'm fine.

498
00:24:38.746 --> 00:24:40.314
I'm in a much better place now.

499
00:24:40.348 --> 00:24:41.788
Yeah. because you've
been laying low.

500
00:24:41.821 --> 00:24:43.461
But what happens when
this thing ramps up?

501
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:46.620
Which it will. You
don't remember Tehran?

502
00:24:46.654 --> 00:24:48.574
Why do you have to put
yourself in this position?

503
00:24:48.598 --> 00:24:50.124
Because it's important.

504
00:24:50.158 --> 00:24:52.726
'Cause the country's
asking me to do it.

505
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.764
I... I mean. I thought that's
what we were doing here.

506
00:24:58.666 --> 00:25:01.602
Yeah. I guess it is.

507
00:25:04.805 --> 00:25:10.244
(train whistle blowing)

508
00:25:10.278 --> 00:25:15.816
(indistinct conversations)

509
00:25:15.849 --> 00:25:18.619
Go. Go make your call.

510
00:25:18.652 --> 00:25:20.854
It's fine. really. Go.

511
00:25:20.888 --> 00:25:22.523
Uh...

512
00:25:22.556 --> 00:25:25.859
- It'll just take a second.
- Mm-hmm.

513
00:25:25.893 --> 00:25:27.595
He really is getting so big.

514
00:25:27.628 --> 00:25:29.697
(line ringing)

515
00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:32.533
ALEJANDRO: Hello.
Hey. how's it going?

516
00:25:32.566 --> 00:25:34.806
It's gonna take me days if I
have to do all these myself.

517
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:36.637
Where the hell are you?

518
00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:39.873
Listen. I just need
a little more time.

519
00:25:39.907 --> 00:25:41.642
How much?

520
00:25:41.675 --> 00:25:45.679
I'm not sure. but. uh. I'm
gonna try to get back soon.

521
00:25:49.717 --> 00:25:51.552
Anything else?

522
00:25:51.585 --> 00:25:52.886
Uh. no.

523
00:25:53.187 --> 00:25:54.322
Great.

524
00:25:54.355 --> 00:25:55.656
(receiver clatters)

525
00:25:55.689 --> 00:25:57.725
(dial tone)

526
00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.362
(receiver clatters. coin drops)

527
00:26:01.395 --> 00:26:03.564
JULIA: You're doing so good.

528
00:26:03.597 --> 00:26:05.233
Hmm?

529
00:26:05.266 --> 00:26:06.634
(children shouting playfully)

530
00:26:06.667 --> 00:26:09.770
Y'all been here all day. man.

531
00:26:11.004 --> 00:26:13.841
Hey. You ain't find nothin'?

532
00:26:15.709 --> 00:26:18.579
I promise you it's
not up there. homie.

533
00:26:20.714 --> 00:26:22.950
Man. I told you.

534
00:26:23.251 --> 00:26:24.718
He wasn't gonna
give up on nothin'.

535
00:26:24.752 --> 00:26:27.755
Wake up. homie.

536
00:26:27.788 --> 00:26:30.190
Franklin.

537
00:26:30.224 --> 00:26:33.727
(dog barking in distance)

538
00:26:33.761 --> 00:26:36.564
(sighs)

539
00:26:36.597 --> 00:26:38.866
My money's got to be here.

540
00:26:38.899 --> 00:26:40.668
(knock on door) RAY-RAY: Lenny.

541
00:26:40.701 --> 00:26:41.902
(mumbling) Shh. shh.

542
00:26:41.935 --> 00:26:43.971
Come on. let's get it. bruh.

543
00:26:44.238 --> 00:26:46.918
(gun clicks) We're going to Fox Hills
Mall and pick up some Staceys.

544
00:26:48.742 --> 00:26:50.578
Come on. bruh. they
gon' sell out.

545
00:26:50.611 --> 00:26:53.714
You in there? Let's go!

546
00:26:53.747 --> 00:26:56.384
(pounding on door)

547
00:26:56.417 --> 00:26:57.785
Lenny!

548
00:27:00.621 --> 00:27:03.090
This a bitch.

549
00:27:03.324 --> 00:27:05.426
I'm out.

550
00:27:07.461 --> 00:27:09.697
(dog barking in distance)

551
00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:10.998
(gun clicks)

552
00:27:14.568 --> 00:27:15.848
No time for this shit. man.
Move.

553
00:27:15.872 --> 00:27:17.805
Hey. you don't like
my humming. huh?

554
00:27:17.838 --> 00:27:18.972
(screams)

555
00:27:19.006 --> 00:27:22.075
- Hold up.
- Get out my face. bruh!

556
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:25.613
(screaming) Fuck you
like my humming now?

557
00:27:25.646 --> 00:27:26.980
(whack)

558
00:27:27.014 --> 00:27:28.416
(bat clatters) Breathe. nigga.

559
00:27:28.449 --> 00:27:30.851
(gasps. coughs)

560
00:27:33.521 --> 00:27:35.723
(coughing)

561
00:27:35.756 --> 00:27:37.425
(gasping)

562
00:27:37.458 --> 00:27:39.760
(coughing)

563
00:27:39.793 --> 00:27:41.395
- Stand up. nigga.
- Ohh!

564
00:27:41.429 --> 00:27:44.832
- Where my money at. homie?!
- (groans)

565
00:27:44.865 --> 00:27:46.634
(screams)

566
00:27:46.667 --> 00:27:49.603
- Where the fuck is my money?
- Fuck you!

567
00:27:49.637 --> 00:27:50.838
(screaming)

568
00:27:50.871 --> 00:27:52.906
- Oh. God!
- Shit!

569
00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.575
- The fuck you doing?
- Shut the fuck up.

570
00:27:54.608 --> 00:27:58.646
Fuck off of me! (Screams)

571
00:27:58.679 --> 00:28:00.848
Shut your ass up!

572
00:28:00.881 --> 00:28:03.517
- Get the fuck off of me!
- Fuck up. nigga.

573
00:28:03.551 --> 00:28:06.487
Nigga. get off! Aah!
(door slams)

574
00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.040
You don't know where
the money at. huh?

575
00:28:08.064 --> 00:28:09.523
This is fucked.

576
00:28:09.557 --> 00:28:11.725
(screams)

577
00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:18.366
You're kidding me.

578
00:28:18.399 --> 00:28:19.667
He's a pinche maricón?

579
00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.001
So. is it done?

580
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:26.006
- No.
- Why not?

581
00:28:26.039 --> 00:28:28.809
- Didn't want to.
- You couldn't take them?

582
00:28:28.842 --> 00:28:33.681
You could have waited till he was alone.
Dije no families.

583
00:28:33.714 --> 00:28:34.982
He's a pinche maricón.

584
00:28:35.015 --> 00:28:36.575
You should have just
taken both of them.

585
00:28:36.599 --> 00:28:39.267
It wasn't right. carajo.

586
00:28:41.088 --> 00:28:43.056
Or maybe I should
just go to my father.

587
00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:45.693
Tell him you killed Max.

588
00:28:45.726 --> 00:28:47.661
Okay.

589
00:28:47.695 --> 00:28:49.663
You want me dead?

590
00:28:52.533 --> 00:28:54.535
- (scoffs)
- Do it right now.

591
00:28:54.568 --> 00:28:56.168
Yeah. you don't think I'll do it?
Ándele.

592
00:28:56.192 --> 00:28:58.529
- You don't think I'll do it?
- Stop it!

593
00:29:00.741 --> 00:29:02.710
Should be Enrique.

594
00:29:02.743 --> 00:29:04.177
No. I told you
Enrique's a killer.

595
00:29:04.211 --> 00:29:05.713
I'll do it. Lucia.

596
00:29:08.916 --> 00:29:11.485
Pero you're both
going to be there.

597
00:29:11.519 --> 00:29:13.954
Watch it happen.

598
00:29:15.523 --> 00:29:17.925
Cuando estás listo.

599
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.502
- Get off me!
- Fuck your shit!

600
00:29:28.536 --> 00:29:30.176
- Shut your ass up.
- Get the fuck off me.

601
00:29:30.203 --> 00:29:31.705
KARVEL: Shut your ass up. nigga.

602
00:29:31.739 --> 00:29:34.508
- Yeah. talk shit now.
- The fuck you doing?

603
00:29:34.542 --> 00:29:36.076
- Shut your ass up.
- The fuck. man?

604
00:29:36.109 --> 00:29:37.878
- Uh-huh.
- What are you doing?

605
00:29:37.911 --> 00:29:39.713
- Get your ass down. yeah.
- What now?

606
00:29:39.747 --> 00:29:41.515
What now? Where the
money at. homie?

607
00:29:41.549 --> 00:29:43.229
Where that money at?
He's killing him. man.

608
00:29:43.253 --> 00:29:45.185
Talk shit now. Say something.

609
00:29:45.218 --> 00:29:50.023
- Get off me. man.
- Fuck me. huh?

610
00:29:50.057 --> 00:29:53.060
(indistinct shouting)

611
00:29:55.429 --> 00:29:56.764
- (screams)
- Say something now.

612
00:29:56.797 --> 00:29:59.132
Shit.

613
00:29:59.166 --> 00:30:02.436
What?

614
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:03.871
- (screams)
- (grunting)

615
00:30:03.904 --> 00:30:05.806
(metal creaking)

616
00:30:05.839 --> 00:30:08.442
He ain't killing him.

617
00:30:08.476 --> 00:30:10.578
(thumping)

618
00:30:10.611 --> 00:30:12.079
He... He giving it to him.

619
00:30:12.112 --> 00:30:14.515
(grunting)

620
00:30:15.749 --> 00:30:17.150
Say something.

621
00:30:17.184 --> 00:30:20.888
(metal creaking)

622
00:30:20.921 --> 00:30:23.190
(screaming and grunting)

623
00:30:40.207 --> 00:30:43.010
(busy signal)

624
00:30:44.545 --> 00:30:45.846
(receiver dings and clatters)

625
00:30:48.015 --> 00:30:51.018
Not what you were hoping for?

626
00:30:53.453 --> 00:30:55.823
Is he out?

627
00:30:55.856 --> 00:30:57.858
No.

628
00:30:57.891 --> 00:30:59.026
I don't know.

629
00:30:59.059 --> 00:31:01.962
It's been a huge day for him.

630
00:31:01.995 --> 00:31:04.498
He'll be okay.

631
00:31:13.006 --> 00:31:15.676
You should go. Teddy.

632
00:31:15.709 --> 00:31:19.212
No. that's okay. Uh.
hey. you hungry?

633
00:31:19.246 --> 00:31:21.114
There's this great
Mexican place.

634
00:31:21.148 --> 00:31:24.017
No.

635
00:31:24.051 --> 00:31:25.686
I'm telling you you should go.

636
00:31:25.719 --> 00:31:29.623
Go do what it is
that you need to do.

637
00:31:29.657 --> 00:31:31.625
Um. let us stay the night here.

638
00:31:31.659 --> 00:31:35.162
and then we'll be
gone in the morning.

639
00:31:35.195 --> 00:31:37.064
Wait. what?

640
00:31:37.097 --> 00:31:38.666
Uh. what?

641
00:31:41.902 --> 00:31:43.704
You don't have to do this.

642
00:31:43.737 --> 00:31:46.139
- Do what?
- This.

643
00:31:46.173 --> 00:31:49.042
This thing that we do.
where you tell me

644
00:31:49.076 --> 00:31:51.979
what you think I want to hear
instead of telling me the truth.

645
00:31:52.012 --> 00:31:54.548
Okay.

646
00:31:54.582 --> 00:31:57.551
Uh. what's the truth?

647
00:31:57.585 --> 00:32:00.888
That we were stationed
together. and it was...

648
00:32:00.921 --> 00:32:02.255
(sighs)

649
00:32:02.289 --> 00:32:04.091
It was fucking great.

650
00:32:04.124 --> 00:32:07.828
It was romantic and exotic.
and I got pregnant.

651
00:32:07.861 --> 00:32:09.863
And instead of telling
me you weren't ready.

652
00:32:09.897 --> 00:32:11.198
you told me you loved me.

653
00:32:11.231 --> 00:32:14.201
Bec... I do.

654
00:32:14.234 --> 00:32:17.738
I love you. I love both of you.

655
00:32:17.771 --> 00:32:19.707
I know.

656
00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:22.175
And I know that being sent to L.A.
wasn't your choice.

657
00:32:22.209 --> 00:32:25.012
Yeah. that's right. It wasn't my...
choice.

658
00:32:25.045 --> 00:32:27.881
But now you're making a
choice to dig in here

659
00:32:27.915 --> 00:32:31.251
and be a part of something
that I can't support.

660
00:32:31.284 --> 00:32:33.053
Okay. look. I think
that you're making

661
00:32:33.086 --> 00:32:35.889
way more of this than it...
It's gonna be.

662
00:32:35.923 --> 00:32:40.628
Teddy. I think you are
making way too little of it.

663
00:32:45.999 --> 00:32:47.935
Look.

664
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.740
I have money.

665
00:32:52.773 --> 00:32:54.808
I have plenty of support.

666
00:32:54.842 --> 00:32:56.944
We'll be fine. We are fine.

667
00:32:56.977 --> 00:32:58.979
We're fine.

668
00:32:59.012 --> 00:33:02.883
If this is what you need
to do. if this is what

669
00:33:02.916 --> 00:33:07.788
you think the country needs
you to do. Teddy. then do it.

670
00:33:07.821 --> 00:33:09.923
Please. come on. let's...
(sighs)

671
00:33:09.957 --> 00:33:12.960
talk about this when
I get back to D.C.

672
00:33:15.362 --> 00:33:17.965
You want to come back to D.C.?

673
00:33:20.768 --> 00:33:22.102
Come on.

674
00:33:28.942 --> 00:33:30.878
You know where we are.

675
00:33:45.726 --> 00:33:47.360
It's not a bad thing. Teddy.

676
00:33:58.238 --> 00:34:01.709
(sighs)

677
00:34:01.742 --> 00:34:03.744
Hey. buddy.

678
00:34:15.388 --> 00:34:17.725
I love you.

679
00:34:27.768 --> 00:34:29.402
(whispers) Now go to sleep.

680
00:34:32.706 --> 00:34:34.374
Yeah.

681
00:34:34.407 --> 00:34:36.744
Okay.

682
00:34:41.048 --> 00:34:43.751
(whispering) Can I keep this?

683
00:34:48.922 --> 00:34:50.791
Go to sleep.

684
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:58.966
(door opens)

685
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:39.072
(floor creaking)

686
00:35:49.416 --> 00:35:52.252
Couple grand. huh?

687
00:35:56.957 --> 00:36:00.994
Karvel. hold up.
That's my money.

688
00:36:05.933 --> 00:36:09.269
(chuckling)

689
00:36:29.489 --> 00:36:31.024
(dog barking in distance)

690
00:36:31.058 --> 00:36:32.359
(engine shuts off)

691
00:36:51.511 --> 00:36:53.513
(door creaks)

692
00:37:19.206 --> 00:37:21.909
(snoring)

693
00:37:36.556 --> 00:37:39.292
(speaking Spanish)

694
00:37:41.228 --> 00:37:43.430
órale.

695
00:37:43.463 --> 00:37:46.466
(snoring continues)

696
00:37:58.411 --> 00:37:59.746
(lighter clicks)

697
00:38:03.951 --> 00:38:06.219
(exhales deeply) Know what?
Maybe you can

698
00:38:06.253 --> 00:38:10.590
stay in the stash house.
watch over everything.

699
00:38:10.623 --> 00:38:13.593
Long as you don't mind the ants.

700
00:38:18.731 --> 00:38:20.300
Why wrestling?

701
00:38:20.333 --> 00:38:23.236
Can't be the money.

702
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:25.105
I just like it.

703
00:38:25.138 --> 00:38:26.539
(speaks Spanish)

704
00:38:26.573 --> 00:38:30.743
Those luchadores were
my heroes growing up.

705
00:38:30.978 --> 00:38:32.545
What did you think
it was going to be?

706
00:38:32.579 --> 00:38:34.114
Fame?

707
00:38:34.147 --> 00:38:35.382
(chuckles) Ladies.

708
00:38:35.415 --> 00:38:38.051
I thought...

709
00:38:38.085 --> 00:38:43.423
it would make me feel...

710
00:38:43.456 --> 00:38:44.992
good.

711
00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.628
And it doesn't?

712
00:38:52.332 --> 00:38:53.733
(tires squealing in distance)

713
00:38:53.766 --> 00:38:56.003
Un carro.

714
00:39:11.344 --> 00:39:12.944
- (lowered voice) Pedro.
- What the fuck?

715
00:39:12.968 --> 00:39:15.371
Shh. Look.

716
00:39:22.062 --> 00:39:25.298
- He's big. that vato.
- Told you he's security.

717
00:39:28.168 --> 00:39:31.371
Okay. look. I'll go to the door.

718
00:39:31.404 --> 00:39:34.541
He'll let me in. I'll make
sure the door's unlocked.

719
00:39:34.574 --> 00:39:36.443
You two go in behind me.

720
00:39:36.476 --> 00:39:38.411
Órale.

721
00:39:44.517 --> 00:39:46.053
(sighs)

722
00:39:48.055 --> 00:39:50.157
Dale.

723
00:39:51.591 --> 00:39:53.026
Dale.

724
00:40:02.035 --> 00:40:03.336
(sighs)

725
00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:05.405
Just wait till I'm inside.

726
00:40:07.174 --> 00:40:09.576
(opens car door)

727
00:40:21.554 --> 00:40:24.224
Mnh-mnh.

728
00:40:24.257 --> 00:40:26.359
(liquor pours)

729
00:40:26.393 --> 00:40:29.028
So. run it down.

730
00:40:29.062 --> 00:40:30.663
What happened?

731
00:40:30.697 --> 00:40:32.665
(dog barking in distance)

732
00:40:32.699 --> 00:40:34.701
Nothin' that can't be handled.

733
00:40:34.734 --> 00:40:37.204
Y'all gonna save me some?
(beads rattle)

734
00:40:41.608 --> 00:40:43.676
Claudia?

735
00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:47.547
Nah. Somethin' else.

736
00:40:49.749 --> 00:40:52.085
What you need?

737
00:41:00.593 --> 00:41:02.629
I need a gun.

738
00:41:20.147 --> 00:41:21.814
Stop.

739
00:41:28.488 --> 00:41:30.757
You sure about that?

740
00:41:39.199 --> 00:41:41.468
I ain't your fucking mama. man.

741
00:41:45.338 --> 00:41:46.739
You take that gun
out of this house.

742
00:41:46.773 --> 00:41:49.509
you better be ready to use it.

743
00:41:49.542 --> 00:41:54.514
You pull it. you hesitate.
that's your funeral.

744
00:41:57.550 --> 00:42:01.788
And if you make that mistake

745
00:42:01.821 --> 00:42:04.524
and your mama show up here.

746
00:42:04.557 --> 00:42:07.360
wilin' out of her mind...

747
00:42:10.897 --> 00:42:13.900
You can be sure...

748
00:42:14.201 --> 00:42:17.237
she'll know that I wasn't the
one that gave you that piece.

749
00:42:25.178 --> 00:42:27.314
(sighs)

750

Hey. Where have
you been all day?

764
00:44:34.707 --> 00:44:36.443
Cho's.

765
00:44:38.378 --> 00:44:40.680
Hmm? Oh. it's fine.

766
00:44:40.713 --> 00:44:42.449
Some shelves fell on me.

767
00:44:42.482 --> 00:44:45.585
Oh. my God. Let me see.

768
00:44:45.618 --> 00:44:48.788
It's fine. Just kind of sore.

769
00:44:48.821 --> 00:44:51.102
Well. then you should think
about getting a different job.

770
00:44:51.126 --> 00:44:52.359
Yeah.

771
00:44:52.392 --> 00:44:54.694
Thinking about that.

772
00:44:54.727 --> 00:44:58.030
You sure you're okay?

773
00:44:58.064 --> 00:45:01.834
Just tired.

774
00:45:01.868 --> 00:45:04.437
WOMAN: It just might work.
