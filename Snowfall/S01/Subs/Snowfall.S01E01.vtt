I'm at the office.

ever a problem.

you were the man to see.

182

I guess that means
there's a problem.

call an ambulance?

I just show you.

know Logan Miller?

277
00:13:12.595 --> 00:13:13.896
Why does a dead CIA officer

278
00:13:13.929 --> 00:13:17.132
have a mountain of
cocaine in a hot tub?

279
00:13:20.836 --> 00:13:23.105
Are you hungry?

(lighter clicks) I know how
it sounds. but this is real.

285
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.229
What you saw is the first
load of many to come.

286
00:13:47.262 --> 00:13:49.582
Real? This... You do understand
that the company isn't even

287
00:13:49.606 --> 00:13:53.669
supposed to be operating on U.S.
soil. don't you? Aren't you?

288
00:13:53.703 --> 00:13:55.437
- That's a little different.
- How?

289
00:13:55.471 --> 00:13:58.641
'Cause I manage foreign
assets living in Los Angeles.

290

- Oh. you're being cute?

291
00:14:04.279 --> 00:14:08.551
No. Would you please...
[grunts] put out the cigarette?

292
00:14:15.658 --> 00:14:17.292
Logan said you'd help me.

293
00:14:17.326 --> 00:14:18.870
All right. well. I've got bad
news for you. Alejandro.

294
00:14:18.894 --> 00:14:20.362
I barely knew Logan Miller.

295
00:14:20.395 --> 00:14:23.165
Well. he knew you... Said
you were a hammerhead.

296
00:14:23.198 --> 00:14:25.334
a patriot who hated communism.

297
00:14:25.367 --> 00:14:27.970
This plan... this is Logan's or yours?
Logan's.

298
00:14:28.003 --> 00:14:29.839
And were you partying
with him last night?

299
00:14:29.872 --> 00:14:31.674
Using. I mean? Or
was it just him?

300
00:14:31.707 --> 00:14:33.108
Why does it matter?
I don't know.

301
00:14:33.142 --> 00:14:35.210
Maybe Logan Miller
woke up yesterday.

302
00:14:35.244 --> 00:14:38.380
looked at 50 kilos' worth of
cocaine hidden in a hot tub.

303
00:14:38.413 --> 00:14:40.850
remembered that Miami was just
on the cover of Time magazine

304
00:14:40.883 --> 00:14:43.203
and Nancy Reagan's out there
telling anyone who will listen

305
00:14:43.227 --> 00:14:45.120
to "Just say no." he
decides to pull the plug.

306
00:14:45.154 --> 00:14:46.989
and that doesn't work for you.

307
00:14:49.191 --> 00:14:51.493
Your government
came to my country.

308
00:14:51.527 --> 00:14:54.496
organized us. trained us.
encouraged us to fight.

309
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.733
And then one day. your Congress
just changed its mind.

310
00:14:57.767 --> 00:14:59.001
I understand that.

311
00:14:59.034 --> 00:15:01.236
Do you understand that right now

312
00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.906
there are literally thousands
of soldiers in the jungle

313
00:15:03.939 --> 00:15:06.742
waiting for me to deliver
supplies and weapons?

314
00:15:06.776 --> 00:15:08.644
They are hungry and sick.

315
00:15:08.678 --> 00:15:11.113
and if I fail. they will die.

316
00:15:14.784 --> 00:15:17.184
Do you honestly think that this
is the best way to help them?

317
00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:18.253
Yes.

318
00:15:18.287 --> 00:15:20.656
But I'm a soldier.
not a drug dealer.

319
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.994
I can't run this operation
without the support of the CIA.

320
00:15:25.027 --> 00:15:26.929
So if you're not the
officer who can help me.

321
00:15:26.962 --> 00:15:31.601
please direct me to who is.
