﻿1
00:00:02.203 --> 00:00:03.638
You're gonna get off your ass

2
00:00:03.672 --> 00:00:05.940
and you're gonna fly us
the fuck out of here!

3
00:00:05.974 --> 00:00:08.509
If this is what you think the
country needs you to do.

4
00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:09.978
then do it.

5
00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:12.446
Let's talk about this
when I get back to D.C.

6
00:00:12.847 --> 00:00:14.282
Where's my money?

7
00:00:14.315 --> 00:00:16.017
(spits)

8
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.919
I don't have time for
this shit. man. Move.

9
00:00:17.952 --> 00:00:20.789
- (grunts. cries)
- (inhales)

10
00:00:20.822 --> 00:00:23.658
(woman screaming) Oh. my God!
Holy shit!

11
00:00:24.025 --> 00:00:26.594
(gagging) What's the matter with you?
Call an ambulance!

12
00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:28.096
TEDDY: You said that there was

13
00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:30.198
no one here besides
you when Logan OD'ed.

14
00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:32.667
Don't worry so much. Teddy Mack.

15
00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:42.176
(horns honking in distance)

16
00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:48.850
(stapler clicks)

17
00:00:51.052 --> 00:00:53.387
(stapler clicking. siren
wailing in distance)

18
00:00:57.358 --> 00:00:58.693
(stapler clicks)

19
00:01:02.096 --> 00:01:04.565
(stapler clicks) JULIA: I like
this one that you started.

20
00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:07.736
- (Paul babbles)
- Who's that? Is that Daddy?

21
00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:10.004
- Dada.
- Oh. that's Daddy's house?

22
00:01:10.038 --> 00:01:12.206
- (Paul laughs)
- You drew your house.

23
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.575
- We going.
- Do you wanna say hi?

24
00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:17.545
Can you say. "Hi. Daddy"?
Say hi to Daddy?

25
00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:19.413
- PAUL: No.
- Do you wanna show...

26
00:01:19.447 --> 00:01:21.567
Do you wanna... do you wanna
tell Daddy your new word?

27
00:01:21.591 --> 00:01:25.820
- (Paul babbles. laughs)
- (laughs)

28
00:01:25.854 --> 00:01:27.321
Yeah! (Gasps)

29
00:01:27.355 --> 00:01:29.557
- Oh. you're a good boy.
- (babbles)

30
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.726
Oh...

31
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.561
- Can you say...
- (babbles)

32
00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:36.597
Oh. Almost. You ready? I'm
gonna throw it to you now.

33
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.199
- Ready for the ball?
- Ready!

34
00:01:38.232 --> 00:01:40.101
Oh! (Laughs)

35
00:01:40.134 --> 00:01:44.538
(Paul giggles. squealing)
(bottle cap clatters)

36
00:01:44.572 --> 00:01:46.841
(laughing) He fell over.

37
00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:49.343
- But I caught it.
- (babbles)

38
00:01:49.377 --> 00:01:52.413
That was such a good catch!

39
00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:54.082
Can you throw it back to Mommy?

40
00:01:54.115 --> 00:01:55.755
(Paul babbles) (telephone
buttons beeping)

41
00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:57.919
- Hey! (Laughs)
- I drop it!

42
00:01:57.952 --> 00:02:00.388
What about this? You wanna
keep drawing with me?

43
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:02.857
(recording stops. line rings)

44
00:02:02.891 --> 00:02:04.292
(line connects) Hello?

45
00:02:04.325 --> 00:02:07.228
Hey. How's the head?

46
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:10.198
I'll never complain
about a migraine again.

47
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:12.133
How'd it go with Avi?

48
00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:13.802
Ah. it was fine. (Sighs)

49
00:02:13.835 --> 00:02:16.037
Wish I could say the
same for the Mexicans.

50
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.939
What happened?

51
00:02:17.972 --> 00:02:19.908
Lucia didn't have the money.

52
00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:21.876
Puta madre.

53
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.245
I gave her 48 hours
to come up with it.

54
00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:25.958
but I don't trust she's
gonna come through.

55
00:02:25.992 --> 00:02:27.926
So I need you to start
looking for another buyer.

56
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.951
(sighs) Why can't you do it?

57
00:02:29.984 --> 00:02:33.254
Because I am going to D.C..

58
00:02:33.287 --> 00:02:34.989
and then to San
Antonio to make sure

59
00:02:35.023 --> 00:02:36.690
that the guns get
to the Contras.

60
00:02:38.192 --> 00:02:39.894
You remember what I told you

61
00:02:39.928 --> 00:02:42.163
about me not being
a drug dealer?

62
00:02:42.196 --> 00:02:43.965
All right. the sooner
we get the money.

63
00:02:43.998 --> 00:02:46.134
the sooner we can get the
supplies to your people.

64
00:02:46.167 --> 00:02:48.502
So just do what you can. okay?

65
00:02:48.536 --> 00:02:50.404
I'll see you in a day or two.

66
00:02:50.438 --> 00:02:52.606
Bye. (line disconnects)

67
00:02:55.543 --> 00:02:56.978
(sighs)

68
00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:08.622
♪♪

69
00:03:14.662 --> 00:03:16.297
(speaks indistinctly)

70
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.466
She probably... Oh. my God.

71
00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:20.334
CLAUDIA: Right
there. right there.

72
00:03:20.368 --> 00:03:23.037
KEVIN: How old is she again? LEON:
Who gives a shit? She fine.

73
00:03:23.071 --> 00:03:24.831
- Hey. I'd hit that.
- After I finish. nigga.

74
00:03:24.855 --> 00:03:27.141
- I'm-a smack that shit up.
- Man. she is fine.

75
00:03:27.175 --> 00:03:29.477
That thing... I'm-a smack it.

76
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.314
What is wrong with you two?
Claudia.

77
00:03:33.347 --> 00:03:36.450
Meet Leon Simmons and Kevin
Hamilton. my business partners.

78
00:03:36.484 --> 00:03:38.652
Is there a Big Brother Big
Sister meetin' around here

79
00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:41.289
I don't know about? (laughs)

80
00:03:41.322 --> 00:03:44.993
Um. FKL Incorporated at
your service. ma'am.

81
00:03:45.026 --> 00:03:46.895
Nigga. no. FLK Incorporated.

82
00:03:46.928 --> 00:03:48.863
- Since when?
- Nigga. you just got here.

83
00:03:48.897 --> 00:03:50.899
Take these clowns back
to the circus. please.

84
00:03:50.932 --> 00:03:53.034
What you say. lady?
We about business.

85
00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:55.669
Look. lil' nigga. the
only business you about.

86
00:03:55.703 --> 00:03:59.040
you pick up a rag and start
polishing wood. (Scoffs)

87
00:03:59.073 --> 00:04:00.708
Otherwise. I need you
and your butt boy

88
00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:02.877
to get the fuck out of here.
Did she just...

89
00:04:02.911 --> 00:04:04.312
I'll handle it. man.
It's all good.

90
00:04:04.345 --> 00:04:06.414
Y'all getting paid either way.

91
00:04:06.447 --> 00:04:08.716
Busted old bitch!

92
00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:10.384
Forget her. Come on.

93
00:04:10.418 --> 00:04:13.421
She don't know who
she talkin' to.

94
00:04:13.454 --> 00:04:15.389
(door creaks open)

95
00:04:15.423 --> 00:04:17.858
I thought you was
serious. young blood.

96
00:04:17.892 --> 00:04:19.327
(door closes) I am.

97
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.861
(unzips bag)

98
00:04:20.895 --> 00:04:24.498
I just need folks I can trust.

99
00:04:24.532 --> 00:04:27.201
You know what a cliché is?

100
00:04:27.235 --> 00:04:29.603
Uh-huh.

101
00:04:29.637 --> 00:04:32.573
Well. I'm gonna hit you
with one right now.

102
00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:35.043
The stuff you dealing in.

103
00:04:35.076 --> 00:04:38.246
ain't nobody you can trust.

104
00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:40.448
I'm only taking two.

105
00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:43.851
Well. I've got four.
and they all pure.

106
00:04:43.884 --> 00:04:46.687
I told you. I am a
purveyor of entertainment.

107
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.456
not a drug dealer.

108
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:52.093
Okay.

109
00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:57.431
You know anybody who
might be interested?

110
00:04:57.465 --> 00:05:00.201
No. Franklin. I do not know
anybody who'd be interested.

111
00:05:00.234 --> 00:05:03.037
Didn't you learn anything in your
encounter with Lenny and Ray-Ray?

112
00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:06.207
You're gonna have to get your
dead presidents someplace else.

113
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.942
You stick around
these four blocks.

114
00:05:07.976 --> 00:05:09.777
you bound to catch fire.

115
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.046
Another cliché?

116
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.682
A prophecy.

117
00:05:18.852 --> 00:05:20.354
You like that?

118
00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:24.758
If you ever want me to
teach you something.

119
00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:26.961
you just come on
back through. 'kay?

120
00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:31.865
Till then. beat it. I'm busy.

121
00:05:40.141 --> 00:05:43.411
It's like when the X-Men went
up against the Hellfire Club.

122
00:05:43.444 --> 00:05:45.244
How the hell they know
how it's gonna go down?

123
00:05:45.268 --> 00:05:47.081
Jean Gray fucked 'em over.

124
00:05:47.115 --> 00:05:50.951
And all Mastermind had to do to
get her to be the Black Queen

125
00:05:50.985 --> 00:05:53.321
was get inside her head.

126
00:05:53.354 --> 00:05:56.857
You do that to a trick.
you'll have her forever.

127
00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.359
What the fuck is
you talking about?

128
00:05:58.392 --> 00:05:59.760
I thought you liked Phoenix.

129
00:05:59.793 --> 00:06:02.496
No one ever really
liked Phoenix.

130
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.732
Her soul was corrupted.

131
00:06:06.567 --> 00:06:08.636
Look at this here.

132
00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.372
Bitch-ass niggas out
here. three for one.

133
00:06:11.405 --> 00:06:13.307
(clip clicks) Out here slippin'.

134
00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:16.277
Hey. you sure you
wanna take it there?

135
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.147
I mean. we robbed them.
and they got us back.

136
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.620
Maybe we could let
this shit slide...

137
00:06:20.644 --> 00:06:22.783
Hey. niggas broke into my spot.

138
00:06:22.816 --> 00:06:25.186
Tied me up and hit me with a
motherfucking baseball bat.

139
00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.655
And you talkin' 'bout letting
that shit ride. nigga?

140
00:06:27.688 --> 00:06:29.390
What the fuck wrong with you?

141
00:06:29.423 --> 00:06:32.993
Okay. I'm ready.

142
00:06:33.027 --> 00:06:34.462
- You rollin'. nigga?
- I'm ready.

143
00:06:34.495 --> 00:06:36.364
- You ready. nigga?
- What?

144
00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:42.870
Roll your window down.

145
00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:44.638
(switch rattles)

146
00:06:44.672 --> 00:06:46.352
What the fuck's wrong
with the window. man?

147
00:06:46.376 --> 00:06:47.708
(rattles)

148
00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:49.981
It's not fucking opening. I
need to roll the window down.

149
00:06:50.005 --> 00:06:53.047
(ignition alert dinging)

150
00:06:53.847 --> 00:06:55.249
Is there a problem?

151
00:06:55.283 --> 00:06:57.385
Don't know.

152
00:06:57.418 --> 00:06:59.820
- What you boys doing here?
- Nothin'.

153
00:06:59.853 --> 00:07:02.022
We just cruisin'.

154
00:07:02.056 --> 00:07:04.058
Then cruise.

155
00:07:04.092 --> 00:07:05.859
I know you don't
live around here.

156
00:07:05.893 --> 00:07:07.928
So move along.

157
00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:11.499
or I can start my day off
right by making an arrest.

158
00:07:11.532 --> 00:07:13.000
Let's go. man.

159
00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:15.603
(window whirring)

160

315
00:14:10.818 --> 00:14:12.452
(whispers) Right?

316
00:14:15.556 --> 00:14:18.626
You can't afford not
to help us. ese.

317
00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:23.531
What are you offering?

318
00:14:23.564 --> 00:14:25.699
(sighs)

319
00:14:25.733 --> 00:14:29.069
A cut from everything
Los Monarcas buy.

320
00:14:33.473 --> 00:14:35.408
(whispers) Set up the meet.

321
00:14:36.644 --> 00:14:39.312
And if Stomper tells you
to go fuck yourself?

322
00:14:39.346 --> 00:14:41.682
Then we'll give you a
half-ounce of blow.

323
00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:43.817
Just for your trouble.

324
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.356
I owe you. vato.

325
00:14:51.324 --> 00:14:54.294
I owe you. Let me pay you back.

326
00:14:54.327 --> 00:14:55.763
Órale.

327
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.002
TEDDY: So the guns are
being held up at the depot

328
00:15:02.035 --> 00:15:04.838
by this mid-level
prick who thinks

329
00:15:04.872 --> 00:15:07.140
he isn't getting enough
respect from the Contras.

330
00:15:07.174 --> 00:15:08.676
I'm sure the
Ambassador just wants

331
00:15:08.709 --> 00:15:10.077
to be taken into consideration.

332
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.080
Okay. well. while he's
waiting for his ego

333
00:15:13.113 --> 00:15:16.717
to be properly stroked. our
guys are dying down there.

334
00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.853
It'll take some time to smooth
it over with the prick.

335
00:15:19.887 --> 00:15:21.722
How much time?

336
00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:24.658
You really want another Bay
of Pigs on your hands?

337
00:15:24.692 --> 00:15:27.327
I thought you had
this under control.

338
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.329
- I do.
- And yet. here we are.

339
00:15:29.362 --> 00:15:34.001
Look. I just need a little push.

340
00:15:34.034 --> 00:15:36.303
Be nice if it came from the top.

341
00:15:37.571 --> 00:15:40.073
Looks like you had some
trouble in Honduras.

342
00:15:40.107 --> 00:15:43.744
I-I don't... What
does that mean?

343
00:15:43.777 --> 00:15:46.279
Do you need someone else
working with you on this?

344
00:15:46.313 --> 00:15:47.915
No.

345
00:15:47.948 --> 00:15:49.617
I-I already have somebody.

346
00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.619
He's a Nicaraguan national.
He's military-trained.

347
00:15:51.652 --> 00:15:53.253
He knows what the stakes are.

348
00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:56.423
Okay. here's the progress
report for the President.

349
00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:59.226
The Contras will have everything
they need once they get those guns.

350
00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:00.728
(chuckles)

351
00:16:00.761 --> 00:16:02.395
You say that again.

352
00:16:02.429 --> 00:16:04.589
and you'll spend the rest of
your career behind a desk.

353
00:16:06.767 --> 00:16:09.402
Maybe I can go around
the Ambassador.

354
00:16:09.436 --> 00:16:12.139
hit up a buddy at the depot.
might expedite things.

355
00:16:12.172 --> 00:16:15.442
I'd appreciate that.

356
00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:18.979
You look like shit. Teddy.

357
00:16:19.012 --> 00:16:21.949
I appreciate that. too.

358
00:16:21.982 --> 00:16:25.418
I hope I haven't made
a mistake with you.

359
00:16:25.452 --> 00:16:28.689
You haven't.

365
00:16:50.477 --> 00:16:52.980
Hi.

366
00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:54.614
Yeah. I. uh.

367
00:16:54.648 --> 00:16:57.651
I tried the office. They
said that you were home.

368
00:16:57.685 --> 00:17:00.688
(babbling)

369
00:17:02.022 --> 00:17:04.658
Sorry. (Clears throat)

370
00:17:04.692 --> 00:17:07.527
Were we supposed to talk today?
(telephone clatters)

371
00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.264
Wh... No. I'm here. I'm...
I'm in D.C.

372
00:17:11.298 --> 00:17:14.301
- I landed this afternoon.
- Oh.

373
00:17:14.334 --> 00:17:16.837
You know. I-I had a-a
meeting with James.

374
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:20.373
but also I was. uh. I was
hoping I could see you.

375
00:17:20.407 --> 00:17:23.143
About?

376
00:17:24.812 --> 00:17:26.747
Okay. Um...

377
00:17:28.348 --> 00:17:31.018
You know. I've... I've been
doing a lot of thinking.

378
00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:33.053
Um...

379
00:17:33.086 --> 00:17:34.654
soul searching or whatever.

380
00:17:34.688 --> 00:17:36.608
Look. I-I haven't stopped
thinking about you guys

381
00:17:36.632 --> 00:17:39.526
since you were in Los Angeles.

382
00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:42.395
And. um. I want us
to be together.

383
00:17:42.429 --> 00:17:43.909
- And I miss you and...
- Teddy. stop.

384
00:17:43.942 --> 00:17:45.476
- No. just hear me out. please.
- Stop.

385
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:47.134
Give me that much. at least.

386
00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:49.469
You know. I-I could've just
shown up at your door.

387
00:17:49.502 --> 00:17:51.404
but I'm trying to do
this the right way.

I don't want any bullshit.

392
00:18:01.281 --> 00:18:02.816
Yeah.

393
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.819
And I don't know if I
want us to be together.

394
00:18:05.853 --> 00:18:08.288
I understand.

395
00:18:10.523 --> 00:18:13.260
I want Thai food.

00:18:13.293 --> 00:18:15.896

I mean. I'm...

420
00:19:18.758 --> 00:19:21.328
I know you don't want in
on the coke business.

421
00:19:22.695 --> 00:19:24.764
I just wanna know why.

I-I mean. you
smart. plenty hard.

Hmm.

00:19:29.202 --> 00:19:32.005
And I know you like that paper.

425
00:19:32.039 --> 00:19:35.075
So if you ain't in the game.
there's gotta be a good reason.

426
00:19:35.108 --> 00:19:37.444
About 18 months ago.

(mouth full) Full of cocaine.

429
00:19:41.982 --> 00:19:44.584
Before that. we were somewhat
a'ight with the Mexicans.

430
00:19:44.617 --> 00:19:48.288
And a lot of people got tapped behind
that situation. (Beads rattle)

431
00:19:48.321 --> 00:19:52.192
And that's the first reason
I don't fuck with no yeyo.

432
00:19:53.393 --> 00:19:57.030
Rule number two. 'cause
there ain't no winners.

Them pigs. they ready to
put you in the clink.

- And... and they will.
- Mm-hmm.

Now rule number three.

436
00:20:04.171 --> 00:20:07.841
you gotta sell to white folk.

way I can do this

00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:19.152
without ending up
dead or in jail.

(exhales) Only way
you can make it safe

444
00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:25.658
is selling right here.
in your own hood.

445
00:20:25.692 --> 00:20:28.061
Just like I do with my bud.

446

Better he hear it from somebody
who ain't related to him.

450
00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:45.812
Go and wait out in the car.

there in a minute.

your tune real quick.

459
00:21:13.473 --> 00:21:15.608
Mm. Mmm!

460
00:21:15.642 --> 00:21:20.280
Look like he ain't the
only one with a hard head.

461
00:21:20.313 --> 00:21:21.953
You know. if he put his
mind on something.

462
00:21:21.986 --> 00:21:23.626
it's gonna be tough to
get him off. right?

463
00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:25.013
Yeah.

464
00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:30.057
I gotta go.

(grunting)

812
00:40:23.389 --> 00:40:26.992
Yeah. yeah. you in the wrong
fucking street. all right.

813
00:40:27.025 --> 00:40:29.461
You strapped? Huh? No. man.

814
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:34.032
I-I just wanna offer you
the product I'm selling.

815

You're making a mistake. man!
I'm not fucking...

821

You're making a mistake. man!
(grunting)

823
00:40:54.486 --> 00:40:57.456
Take him up in the house.
(speaks Spanish)

824
00:40:57.489 --> 00:41:00.192
That's my jaina's goddaughter. vato.
Get him upstairs now.

Come on. man!

828
00:41:07.933 --> 00:41:09.468
I'm telling you the truth. man.

829
00:41:09.501 --> 00:41:11.903
I can explain everything.
Shut the fuck up. man!

830
00:41:11.937 --> 00:41:13.205
You're making a mistake. man!

831
00:41:13.239 --> 00:41:14.940
I'm just here to sell
my product. man!

832
00:41:14.973 --> 00:41:17.743

(panting) (dog
barking in distance)

838
00:41:33.825 --> 00:41:35.427
What did he do?

839
00:41:35.461 --> 00:41:37.763
He's a mayate in the wrong
fucking neighborhood.

840
00:41:37.796 --> 00:41:40.166
Maybe he came here to smoke us.

841
00:41:40.199 --> 00:41:42.201
No. man. (Inhales sharply)

842
00:41:44.336 --> 00:41:47.306
He had this.

843
00:41:47.339 --> 00:41:50.242
And I don't answer to you.
so get the fuck outta here.

844
00:41:50.276 --> 00:41:53.845
I know this vato.
He's coming with me.

845
00:41:53.879 --> 00:41:56.482
(laughs) I don't give a fuck...
(whistles)

846
00:42:11.963 --> 00:42:16.134
You show your face here
again. you a dead man.

847
00:42:16.168 --> 00:42:18.670
(panting) You got a car?

848
00:42:18.704 --> 00:42:20.138
Hmm? Huh?

849
00:42:20.172 --> 00:42:21.607
You got a fucking car?

850
00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.609
(continues panting)
Hey. you okay?

851
00:42:23.642 --> 00:42:26.612
What? You okay?

852
00:42:26.645 --> 00:42:29.615
What you doing here. Oso? Huh?
You need to go. okay?

853
00:42:29.648 --> 00:42:31.149
I remember you. too.

854

What?

868
00:43:59.505 --> 00:44:01.473
You know her?

Yes.

Well. how?

871
