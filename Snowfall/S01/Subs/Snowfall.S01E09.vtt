00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:05.724
- What's up with you?
- I've gotta tell you something.

2
00:00:05.748 --> 00:00:07.909
Gustavo. nice boots.

3
00:00:07.942 --> 00:00:09.462
I haven't seen you
in a couple of days.

4
00:00:09.486 --> 00:00:11.412
I've been busy.

5
00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:13.247
You fucking piece of shit!
(shattering)

6
00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:15.917
You have the balls to come in
here after running to daddy?

7
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.252
Anyone else here? Gustavo?

8
00:00:18.286 --> 00:00:19.487
I don't know where he is.

9
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.089
We have to talk.

10
00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:22.590
You can't do it alone.

11
00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:23.925
I'm not alone.

12
00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.478
Does Club Glitter
mean anything to you?

13
00:00:25.502 --> 00:00:27.495
Did that sister find
out we were there?

14
00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:30.264
No. she met some guys and left with them.
What guys?

15
00:00:30.298 --> 00:00:33.267
He kinda looked like. like.
a Latino Freddie Mercury.

16
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:35.436
- What you boys doing here?
- We just cruisin'.

17
00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:36.938
Then cruise.

18
00:00:36.971 --> 00:00:39.273
We sell it right here in the hood.
Same as weed.

19
00:00:39.307 --> 00:00:41.442
$100.000 off a single key?

(click)

21
00:00:43.978 --> 00:00:46.280
Oh. shit. (Grunts)

22
00:00:46.314 --> 00:00:47.515
(gunshot)

23
00:00:49.317 --> 00:00:51.185
I'm comin'. man!

24
00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.500
They're on their way. You're
gonna be all right. (Gasping)

CISSY: Yeah. I know. I-I heard.

35
00:01:51.212 --> 00:01:53.681
Um. have you seen Franklin?

36
00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:55.683
Mm-hmm. Can you just...

37
00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:58.352
(sighs) Just send
him home. you know?

38
00:01:58.386 --> 00:02:01.022
I just... I just
need to see him.

39
00:02:01.055 --> 00:02:04.025
Or he can call me or.
you know. just. uh...

40

All right. (receiver thuds)

Where have you been?!

45
00:02:30.418 --> 00:02:33.054
At the station.

46
00:02:33.087 --> 00:02:35.223
(exhales sharply)

47
00:02:35.256 --> 00:02:37.959
God. (Exhales)

48
00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:43.064
- Mm.
- (Kisses)

(both exhale)

51
00:02:53.174 --> 00:02:56.410
Hope you could give
them more than I could.

52
00:02:56.444 --> 00:02:58.913
Did the back and forth
there for over two hours.

53
00:02:58.947 --> 00:03:00.748
You went to the hospital?
(lighter flicks)

54
00:03:00.781 --> 00:03:02.817
Mm-hmm. How's Leon?

55
00:03:02.851 --> 00:03:05.086
He caught two bullets. Franklin.

56
00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:06.754
He's lucky to be alive.

57
00:03:06.787 --> 00:03:09.623
Marla was hysterical. I
didn't have much for her.

58
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.328
He gonna be good. though?

59
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.799
Looks that way. Yeah.

60
00:03:22.303 --> 00:03:23.972
(exhales sharply)

61
00:03:26.374 --> 00:03:29.610
You gon' make me ask?

62
00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:32.780
It's Leon. You know.

63
00:03:32.813 --> 00:03:34.282
Always starting some shit.

64
00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:37.118
Finally mouthed off
to the wrong person.

65
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:39.353
You know. he probably caught
him coming by the house.

66
00:03:39.387 --> 00:03:41.990
So you had nothing to
do with it. right?

67
00:03:43.524 --> 00:03:45.960
No.

68
00:03:45.994 --> 00:03:48.229
Come on. Mom. Of course not.

69
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:52.700
You scare me. Franklin.

70
00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:55.803
(breathing unevenly)

71
00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:59.473
How easy it is for you
to look me in the eye

72
00:03:59.507 --> 00:04:02.310
and lie your ass off.

73
00:04:02.343 --> 00:04:05.146
You got your best friend's
blood on your clothes

74
00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:07.848
and you don't miss
a goddamn beat.

75
00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:12.486
(dog barking in distance)

76
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.922
Jerome was here.

77
00:04:16.057 --> 00:04:19.327
Heard the news.
Wanted to check in.

78
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.229
Guilt was all over his face.

79
00:04:21.262 --> 00:04:22.997
At least someone in this family

80
00:04:23.031 --> 00:04:25.166
has still got a fucking conscience.
What'd he say?

81
00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:27.201
He didn't have to say shit.

82
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.905
I wanna hear it from you.

83
00:04:33.441 --> 00:04:35.209
What you wanna hear?

84
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.880
Start with how long you've been
slinging the weed for him.

85
00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:48.689
Six months.

86
00:04:48.722 --> 00:04:50.258
Give or take.

87
00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:56.864
Six months you've been
lying to my face.

88
00:04:56.897 --> 00:04:59.033
Playing me for a goddamn fool.

89
00:04:59.067 --> 00:05:01.202
No. it was never easy lying to you.
(scoffs)

90
00:05:01.235 --> 00:05:02.870
And I didn't like it. (chuckles)

91
00:05:02.903 --> 00:05:06.107
But I had to step up. get
somethin' real going.

92
00:05:08.977 --> 00:05:11.245
Ain't like you don't know
about smoking no weed.

93
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.115
What you say?

94
00:05:14.148 --> 00:05:16.284
Who the fuck you think
you talkin' to?!

95
00:05:16.317 --> 00:05:19.620
You ain't gonna fucking talk to me
this way. You... (pounding on door)

96
00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:21.222
Miss Cissy?

97

(dogs barking in distance)

98
00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:26.560
(door creaking) I. uh...

99
00:05:26.594 --> 00:05:29.597
hope it's not too late.

100
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.069
- You doin' all right?
- Yeah. we're good.

(barking continues)

102
00:05:37.005 --> 00:05:39.005
CISSY: I already talked to
a bunch of your friends.

103
00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:42.476
ANDRE: Yeah. I wanted a
minute with the boy.

104
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.412
if you don't mind.

105
00:05:44.445 --> 00:05:46.480

speak for himself.

Hey. Franklin.

109
00:05:56.124 --> 00:05:58.592
Hey. relax. relax.

110
00:05:58.626 --> 00:06:02.263
All right. I know you've seen
your fair share of badges today.

111
00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:03.764
I was hoping you and me.

112
00:06:03.797 --> 00:06:05.599
we could have a
different conversation.

113
00:06:05.633 --> 00:06:07.768
It's like I told them.
man. I don't...

114
00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:10.604
I don't know anything and
I didn't see anything.

115
00:06:10.638 --> 00:06:13.607
What if I told you I saw two
boys parked down the street

116
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:15.143
watching your house?

117
00:06:16.644 --> 00:06:19.113
Got a good look at their faces.

118
00:06:19.147 --> 00:06:22.283
All I need you to do is help
me fill in some blanks.

119
00:06:22.316 --> 00:06:24.618
Give me a name.

120
00:06:24.652 --> 00:06:27.155
I'll take care of the rest.

121
00:06:30.691 --> 00:06:32.826
Afraid I can't help you.

122
00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:36.497
Excuse me.

JULIA: And what about
the fish tank?

126
00:07:08.028 --> 00:07:09.730
(mouth full) Fish tank?

127
00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:12.733
Yeah. it's in the back
of the storage unit.

128
00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:15.836
Remember you said you thought
fish would be soothing?

Oh. right.

130

Yeah. that seemed
like a good idea.

Until I realized we'd have
a vat of floating bacteria

You have bigger things to worry about
than a fish tank. (Door rattles open)

Oh. shit. Uh. Jules. sorry.
Look. I gotta run.

Um. you know. why don't
you just get rid

of the fish tank if
you want. all right?

138

Yeah. sure. Fine.

Okay. I'll talk to you soon.
I love you.

Her Jeep was hit.

145
00:08:10.758 --> 00:08:12.626
But they got her out.

146
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.980
She had some burns. but nothing too bad.
(bottle cap opens)

147

Flew her to Soto

The... the camp. the
processing tent.

our pipeline?

(gasps. sniffles)

153

I have other suppliers
we can use for now.

00:08:34.948 --> 00:08:37.485
Who?

155
00:08:40.788 --> 00:08:42.022
The Colombians?

156
00:08:43.491 --> 00:08:46.427
It'll keep things moving.

157
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.197
Who are they? Escobar's people?

158
00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:53.934
Escobar's too powerful.

159
00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:56.270
Could run us over and
not even feel the bump.

160
00:08:56.304 --> 00:08:58.172
Okay.

161
00:08:59.507 --> 00:09:00.841
The Medellín Cartel controls.

162
00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:03.110
like. 90% of the
Colombian coke trade.

163
00:09:03.143 --> 00:09:06.447
Uh-huh. And we'll be dealing
with the other 10%.

164
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.949
Out of Cali.

165
00:09:08.982 --> 00:09:11.785
Can they meet our needs?

166
00:09:11.819 --> 00:09:14.622
At decent prices.

167
00:09:14.655 --> 00:09:16.290
But there'll be a
bigger slice taken out

168
00:09:16.324 --> 00:09:18.359
than getting the
leaves from Peru.

169
00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:22.093
Yeah. but I guess I'm more
concerned with whether or not

170
00:09:22.117 --> 00:09:23.351
we can trust them.

171
00:09:30.671 --> 00:09:33.374
Oh...

172
00:09:33.407 --> 00:09:36.377
Okay. Um. okay.

173
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.379
How soon can we sit
down with them?

174
00:09:38.412 --> 00:09:42.182
(exhales) The next few days.
but it has to be just me.

175
00:09:44.852 --> 00:09:47.555
Hey. trust me. I'm
doing you a favor.

176
00:09:49.423 --> 00:09:53.394
(horn blares)

177
00:09:53.427 --> 00:09:55.996
GUSTAVO: Pinche Pedro.

178
00:09:56.029 --> 00:09:57.665
What did Ramiro say?

179
00:09:57.698 --> 00:10:01.502
Well. he wasn't happy.
Obviously.

180
00:10:01.535 --> 00:10:04.004
But he agreed to
keep things running.

181
00:10:04.037 --> 00:10:06.840
(distant shouting) (scoffs)

182
00:10:06.874 --> 00:10:09.009
He's letting it continue.
(siren wailing in distance)

183
00:10:09.042 --> 00:10:11.845
(speaking Spanish)

184
00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:13.847
(engine revving)

185
00:10:13.881 --> 00:10:17.351
(sighs)

186
00:10:17.385 --> 00:10:20.354
First. Ramiro's taking control
of the entire operation.

187
00:10:20.388 --> 00:10:22.890
He's taking it away from you?

188
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.929
It could be a lot worse.

189
00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:30.698
(chuckles softly)

190
00:10:30.731 --> 00:10:34.435
Peor que being Ramiro's slave?
Hmm?

191
00:10:36.404 --> 00:10:39.307
He also doesn't wanna do
business with Stomper anymore.

192
00:10:40.774 --> 00:10:42.710
Those Monarcas pose
too much risk.

193
00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:44.077
and we don't need them.

194
00:10:45.446 --> 00:10:46.880
Once my father's gone.

195
00:10:46.914 --> 00:10:50.217
we could use our own
distribution network.

196
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:54.822
And what do I tell El
Stomper and Hernan? Hmm?

197
00:11:05.599 --> 00:11:07.968
You aren't to do anything.

198
00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:10.604
Should be enough for
you to start over.

199
00:11:13.106 --> 00:11:14.842
(exhales sharply)

200
00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:20.648
You want me to run?

201
00:11:26.153 --> 00:11:31.425
You killed two of his men.
He's not gonna let that go.

202
00:11:31.459 --> 00:11:34.995
You're siding with him? Hmm?

203
00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:37.431
(speaking Spanish)

204
00:11:37.465 --> 00:11:39.333
Con mi familia. Oso.

205
00:11:39.367 --> 00:11:42.002
Con mi familia.

206
00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:45.606
¿Qué quieres que haga? You want
me to turn my back on them?

207
00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:46.874
Run away with you?

208
00:11:51.879 --> 00:11:53.647
(huffs)

209
00:12:01.655 --> 00:12:03.156
Look at me.

210
00:12:05.859 --> 00:12:07.628
(hits truck) Look at me. carajo.

211
00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:10.464
(siren wailing)

212
00:12:10.498 --> 00:12:13.967
(tires screech. siren passes)

213
00:12:14.001 --> 00:12:16.003
I'm not gonna run.

214
00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.710
And maybe we don't have to run.

215
00:12:29.182 --> 00:12:32.019
(sirens wailing in distance)

216
00:12:43.697 --> 00:12:44.898
(indistinct conversations)

217
00:12:44.932 --> 00:12:46.434
(engine starts)

218
00:12:48.602 --> 00:12:50.337
(horn honks)

219
00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.407
(conversations continue)

220
00:12:59.913 --> 00:13:02.516
(car doors closing)

221
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.553
(girls murmuring. giggling)

222
00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.857
Been trying to get a minute
with you. but your pops.

223
00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.459
you know. we have...

224
00:13:33.481 --> 00:13:35.415
(girls laugh)

225
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.886
Ooh! (Giggling)

226
00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:40.821
(giggles)

227
00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:44.391
Summer classes going okay?

228
00:13:44.424 --> 00:13:46.894
(chuckles) Boring as hell.

229
00:13:46.927 --> 00:13:50.063
but it'll look good
on my transcripts.

230
00:13:50.097 --> 00:13:51.398
(horn honks)

231
00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:53.400
How's Leon?

232
00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:56.403
Coming home from the
hospital today.

233
00:13:56.436 --> 00:13:59.907
And you? You all right?

234
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.174
Cool.

235
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.745
(door closes) Thanks
for walking me home.

236
00:14:04.778 --> 00:14:06.658
(beads rattle) My daddy
brought the hammer down.

237
00:14:06.692 --> 00:14:08.052
Don't want me around
none of y'all.

238
00:14:08.076 --> 00:14:10.250
So we gonna have to
roll a different way.

239
00:14:10.283 --> 00:14:12.920
It's all good. though.

240
00:14:12.953 --> 00:14:15.422
I know it's a little messy.

241
00:14:15.455 --> 00:14:17.257
I didn't expect you
to come. so...

242
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:18.959
(beads rattling)

243
00:14:31.705 --> 00:14:35.442
The... the cops.

244
00:14:35.475 --> 00:14:39.847
They was on their way.
and. you know. and Leon...

245
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.782
I had to think fast. Mel.

246
00:14:41.815 --> 00:14:44.885
I couldn't risk 'em
searching my house.

247
00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.957
So...

248
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.292
you gonna risk my ass

249
00:14:52.325 --> 00:14:54.294
by bringing that
shit into my crib?

250
00:14:54.327 --> 00:14:56.697
I couldn't see any other way.

251
00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.866
(exhales sharply)

252
00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:00.467
I thought you was down with me.

253
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.071
And I thought you
actually cared about me.

254
00:15:06.674 --> 00:15:08.141
But you can't see anything else

255
00:15:08.175 --> 00:15:10.644
besides what's in
that fucking bag.

256
00:15:10.678 --> 00:15:13.146
I'm sorry. It's not gonna happen again.
No. Franklin. just go.

257
00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.381
Just... don't touch me. It's...

258
00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:16.316
Get out. Get out of my house.

259
00:15:16.349 --> 00:15:18.552
Get out.

260
00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:31.164
(sighs deeply)

261
00:15:31.198 --> 00:15:33.567
(knock on door)

262
00:15:37.204 --> 00:15:38.505
- Hey.
- Hi.

263
00:15:38.538 --> 00:15:41.675
Victoria. come in.

264
00:15:41.709 --> 00:15:43.010
How's it goin'?

265
00:15:43.043 --> 00:15:46.179
Okay. (Sighs) (door creaks)

266
00:15:46.213 --> 00:15:48.682
How about you? Yeah. Okay.

267
00:15:48.716 --> 00:15:50.751
What's goin' on?

268
00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:55.355
Oh. um. actually. I
just wanted to. uh...

269
00:15:55.388 --> 00:15:57.524
I just wanted to
get you something.

270
00:15:57.557 --> 00:16:01.028
What is it? You know. it's to
thank you for all of your help.

271
00:16:01.061 --> 00:16:03.196
No. you don't... you
don't have to do that.

272
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.198
It's from "Harvey."

273
00:16:05.232 --> 00:16:07.367
You know. that one with the
giant invisible rabbit

274
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.037
that only Jimmy Stewart
can see. so...

275
00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.872
I can't accept this.

276
00:16:11.905 --> 00:16:14.708
Oh. no. I insist.

277
00:16:14.742 --> 00:16:18.712
I mean. you've been the one
bright spot in all of this.

278
00:16:18.746 --> 00:16:20.881
So...

279
00:16:20.914 --> 00:16:24.284
Yeah. Especially when I was
throwing up everywhere

280
00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:27.621
and getting punched in the face.
(laughs) Yeah.

281
00:16:27.655 --> 00:16:30.658
Uh. yeah. Especially then.
(chuckles)

282
00:16:32.092 --> 00:16:35.763
Listen. I just...

283
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:41.068
I can't keep doing
this for much longer.

284
00:16:41.101 --> 00:16:44.137
At a certain point. I just have
to accept that she's. uh...

285
00:16:46.106 --> 00:16:47.941
that she's gone. you know?

286
00:16:49.609 --> 00:16:51.578
(sighs)

287
00:16:51.611 --> 00:16:54.581
Hey.

288
00:16:54.614 --> 00:16:56.917
You've done more than
anybody else would have.

289
00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:00.320
Well. I don't know if
that's true. but...

290
00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:01.955
thank you.

291
00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:06.326
Can I...

292
00:17:07.961 --> 00:17:09.930
Mm.

293
00:17:09.963 --> 00:17:11.965
(exhales)

294
00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:16.804
(exhales) Okay. I
should probably go.

295
00:17:20.473 --> 00:17:22.442
Okay. (breathes sharply)

296
00:17:22.475 --> 00:17:24.011
Bye.

297
00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:25.979
(door creaks closed)

298
00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.883
(inhales sharply)

299
00:17:31.484 --> 00:17:33.520
(inhales sharply)

300
00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:38.859
(dog barking in distance)

301
00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:40.694
Hey. (door closes)

302
00:17:42.162 --> 00:17:43.630
Jerome ain't here.

303
00:17:43.663 --> 00:17:46.366
I was looking for Franklin.

304
00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:48.168
He's not here neither.

305
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.140
(door creaking)

306
00:17:53.173 --> 00:17:54.908
(rustling)

307
00:17:56.676 --> 00:17:58.645
How much you involved
in all of this?

308
00:17:58.678 --> 00:18:01.648
(scoffs) Here we go.

309
00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:03.216
What? You comin' for me. too?

310
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.385
Well. you and Jerome always
lock. step. and barrel

311
00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:08.488
and everything. Okay. all right.
All right. all right. okay.

312
00:18:08.521 --> 00:18:10.157
(sighs)

313
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:11.725
Look. I feel you.

314
00:18:11.759 --> 00:18:14.227
Things are sideways. shit
brought into your home.

315
00:18:14.261 --> 00:18:15.829
So I ain't gonna
take it personally.

316
00:18:15.863 --> 00:18:19.666
but Jerome ain't here.
Franklin ain't here.

317
00:18:19.699 --> 00:18:22.736
It's just me. So...

318
00:18:25.372 --> 00:18:28.041
(rustling)

319
00:18:38.718 --> 00:18:40.687
(purse thuds)

320
00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.289
Here. let me get
you some coffee.

321
00:18:46.726 --> 00:18:49.262
It's all falling apart.

322
00:18:49.296 --> 00:18:51.031
No. it ain't.

323
00:18:51.064 --> 00:18:54.201
I should've never let
him quit college.

324
00:18:54.234 --> 00:18:56.870
Throwing away all the
advantages I gave him.

325
00:18:56.904 --> 00:19:00.874
Nah. you was happy to
have him back home.

326
00:19:00.908 --> 00:19:03.210
My brother was happy
to have him slinging.

327
00:19:03.243 --> 00:19:05.123

It ain't about the money.

658
00:37:09.896 --> 00:37:13.799
It's about Claudia.

RAMIRO: These numbers look good.

663

You know. once this ramps
up. it's gonna happen fast.

664
00:37:42.261 --> 00:37:44.596
More people. more weapons.

Then we'll bring in someone
to look at the books.

666
00:37:48.767 --> 00:37:51.203
I don't need any

I know.

668

You get into cocaine.
could get violent.

669

It's Victoria calling.

679
00:38:46.092 --> 00:38:48.460
I-I think I found something
that might possibly help us.

680
00:38:48.494 --> 00:38:50.534
So if you could just call
me back when you get this.

681

I wanna share it with you.

682
00:38:52.098 --> 00:38:54.066
You know. you've been so
helpful with everything.

683
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.300
you know. getting in a fist
fight and you throwing up...

684
00:38:56.324 --> 00:38:57.903
Hello. hey. it's me. Oh. hi.

685
00:38:57.936 --> 00:39:00.139
I think I found a lead.
Yeah. what'd you find?

686
00:39:00.172 --> 00:39:01.907
So I was packing
up Kristin's stuff

687
00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.909
to take back home.
including her pictures.

688
00:39:03.942 --> 00:39:06.245
and that's when I started
thinking about photos.

689
00:39:06.278 --> 00:39:08.414
And I remembered seeing
someone taking photos

690
00:39:08.447 --> 00:39:10.082
at the club the other night.

691
00:39:10.116 --> 00:39:12.418
And so I went back to Glitter
and they put me in contact

692
00:39:12.451 --> 00:39:14.253
with Rinaldi. who
was there the night

693
00:39:14.286 --> 00:39:16.255
that Kristin went missing.
How you doing?

694
00:39:16.288 --> 00:39:18.257
And he had all these photos.
so show him the one.

696
00:39:20.126 --> 00:39:24.096
That's them! Leaving the club.

Yeah. He's the one.

702
00:39:36.975 --> 00:39:38.944
He's the answer to all this.
