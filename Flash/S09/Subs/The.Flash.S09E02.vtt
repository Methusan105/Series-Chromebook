1
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.963
So who are you?

2
00:00:06.963 --> 00:00:08.138
Hey.

3
00:00:08.138 --> 00:00:10.227
we got your alert.
Where's...

4
00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:13.926
That's not Caitlin.

5
00:00:13.926 --> 00:00:15.972
Uh...

6
00:00:15.972 --> 00:00:17.843
What's--what's happening here?

7
00:00:17.843 --> 00:00:21.369
Actually. it's kind of a long
and very confusing story.

8
00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.113
One which we are
happy to share.

9
00:00:26.113 --> 00:00:29.333
First. please meet--
- You can call me Snow.

10
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:32.423
Wait. as in. like.
the third Snow sister?

11
00:00:32.423 --> 00:00:34.469
Barry. do you remember
the time that you found out

12
00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.340
Caitlin was trying
to bring back Frost.

13
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.038
and you destroyed her lab?

14
00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:40.214
I didn't have a choice.

15
00:00:40.214 --> 00:00:42.085
The point is.

16
00:00:42.085 --> 00:00:44.044
Caitlin never gave up.

17
00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.046
She kept on working with me.

18
00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.700
Together. we built a machine
to reactivate Frost's mind

19
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.093
in Caitlin's body.

20
00:00:50.093 --> 00:00:52.139
Only...
- Something went wrong.

21
00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:54.706
But in place of Caitlin...

22
00:00:54.706 --> 00:00:56.360
I came out instead.

23
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.146
Well. if you're not
Caitlin or Frost.

24
00:00:59.146 --> 00:01:00.321
who are you?

25
00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:03.063
Honestly. I don't know.

26
00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:08.068
I wanna find out who I am just
as much as the rest of you do.

27
00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:11.723
Snow here is
a total blank slate

28
00:01:11.723 --> 00:01:13.377
with zero memories.

29
00:01:13.377 --> 00:01:16.206
So I've been doing my best
to bring her up to speed.

30
00:01:16.206 --> 00:01:18.774
Mark.
what happened to Caitlin?

31
00:01:22.952 --> 00:01:24.780
Where is she?

32
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.129
Caitlin's dead. Barry.

33
00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:27.565
- What?
- That's impossible.

34
00:01:27.565 --> 00:01:29.089
I--I--I know
what you must be thinking.

35
00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:32.831
but I have a plan
to bring Caitlin back.

36
00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:02.774
Now the CRC was supposed to
unzip neural DNA from Caitlin.

37
00:02:02.774 --> 00:02:04.863
That way. we could isolate
Frost's brain patterns

38
00:02:04.863 --> 00:02:07.779
inside of her--
- Download into another

39
00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:09.129
new body later on.

40
00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.434
Only a power fluctuation

41
00:02:10.434 --> 00:02:13.220
caused the process
to malfunction.

42
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.091
and so if

43
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:19.182
Team Flash could provide me
with a stable energy source.

44
00:02:19.182 --> 00:02:21.010
we could reverse the process

45
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.143
and just bring Caitlin back.

46
00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:25.449
So now you want our help?

47
00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:28.104
For Caitlin's sake.

48
00:02:28.104 --> 00:02:29.323
yeah.

49
00:02:31.803 --> 00:02:34.110
It's Caitlin.
We have to try.

50
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.330
Yeah. I'm sold.

51
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.809
What do we have to lose?

52
00:02:40.682 --> 00:02:41.726
Okay.

53
00:02:42.945 --> 00:02:45.643
Let's get to work.

54
00:02:52.433 --> 00:02:54.261
How did I do?

55
00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:55.827
Are you kidding?

56
00:02:55.827 --> 00:02:57.307
You were perfect.

57
00:02:57.307 --> 00:02:59.788
This is going better
than we planned.

58
00:03:02.094 --> 00:03:03.313
What?

59
00:03:04.488 --> 00:03:05.837
This is what Caitlin wanted.

60
00:03:07.535 --> 00:03:10.146
And when we're done.

61
00:03:10.146 --> 00:03:12.888
Frost will be back.

62
00:03:20.722 --> 00:03:23.333
<i>I can't believe
this is really happening.</i>

63
00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:24.943
I mean. this is nuts.

64
00:03:24.943 --> 00:03:26.031
Yeah. I know. right?

65
00:03:27.816 --> 00:03:30.906
Especially with. uh.

66
00:03:30.906 --> 00:03:35.040
you know. everything else
that's happened lately.

67
00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:45.399
Allegra. look.
about what happened.

68
00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:47.096
I just want you to know--
- I think we should focus

69
00:03:47.096 --> 00:03:50.839
on Caitlin first...

70
00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:53.537
and then. you know.
when this is all done--

71
00:03:53.537 --> 00:03:55.322
Uh. yeah. yeah. totally.

72
00:03:55.322 --> 00:03:56.540
I get it.
- Yeah.

73
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.064
Right.

74
00:03:59.064 --> 00:04:00.718
Okay.

75
00:04:09.901 --> 00:04:12.164
What a day.

76
00:04:12.164 --> 00:04:13.644
I still can't believe it.

77
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.563
So Caitlin's gone?

78
00:04:19.563 --> 00:04:21.435
I know.

79
00:04:21.435 --> 00:04:23.654
It's too much--

80
00:04:23.654 --> 00:04:24.742
all of it.

81
00:04:26.178 --> 00:04:28.964
Babe. you okay?

82
00:04:28.964 --> 00:04:30.400
Mm-mm.

83
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.230
When Barry called.
he said Mark has a plan

84
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.927
to get Caitlin back.

85
00:04:35.927 --> 00:04:38.843
Joe. that is not even close
to our only problem.

86
00:04:40.018 --> 00:04:42.369
I think
we should leave Central City.

87
00:04:45.372 --> 00:04:48.418
Cecile. the reason

88
00:04:48.418 --> 00:04:50.377
I said we should leave

89
00:04:50.377 --> 00:04:52.596
is because I'm worried that

90
00:04:52.596 --> 00:04:54.903
the stronger
your new abilities become.

91
00:04:54.903 --> 00:04:57.079
the more it puts you
on the front line.

92
00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:58.428
- Come on--
- God knows

93
00:04:58.428 --> 00:04:59.777
you can handle anything.

94
00:04:59.777 --> 00:05:02.389
but I'm still worried
about who or what

95
00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:04.391
is coming
after the woman I love

96
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:06.436
and the mother of my child.

97
00:05:08.656 --> 00:05:10.440
This family can't...

98
00:05:12.181 --> 00:05:13.965
It can't handle losing you.

99
00:05:16.272 --> 00:05:18.230
Okay.

100
00:05:30.417 --> 00:05:31.635
Look.

101
00:05:34.856 --> 00:05:36.771
Babe. I get it.

102
00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:38.816
I do.

103
00:05:38.816 --> 00:05:42.298
But what you're asking me.
how am I supposed to...

104
00:05:42.298 --> 00:05:45.040
choose between our family

105
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.129
and the greater good
of the entire city?

106
00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:48.348
How am I supposed to do that?

107
00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:51.351
What am I supposed to do?

108
00:05:53.657 --> 00:05:55.920
What are we supposed to do?

109
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.095
I don't know.

110
00:06:05.756 --> 00:06:07.541
I really wanted to see

111
00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:09.369
Old Faithful.

112
00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:12.023
We can go
to Yellowstone anytime.

113
00:06:12.023 --> 00:06:14.199
Right now. it's more important
we stay here

114
00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:16.114
to help Mark.

115
00:06:16.114 --> 00:06:17.377
Are you okay?

116
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.688
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:27.038 --> 00:06:28.213
Barry--

118
00:06:28.213 --> 00:06:29.432
Barry. please.

119
00:06:34.437 --> 00:06:36.744
Are you?

120
00:06:36.744 --> 00:06:40.443
If Mark's plan
doesn't work...

121
00:06:40.443 --> 00:06:41.966
It has to.

122
00:06:46.275 --> 00:06:47.624
<i>♪ I. I. I. I</i>

123
00:06:47.624 --> 00:06:48.886
<i>♪ I feel like</i>

124
00:06:48.886 --> 00:06:50.584
<i>♪ I feel like dancing</i>

125
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.118
Oh!

126
00:07:03.118 --> 00:07:04.815
Buy you a drink. handsome?

127
00:07:06.295 --> 00:07:07.427
One of us

128
00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:08.558
is still working.

129
00:07:08.558 --> 00:07:10.255
Oh. wow.

130
00:07:10.255 --> 00:07:11.953
I'll be sure to leave that
Employee of the Month badge

131
00:07:11.953 --> 00:07:13.258
on your side
of the bed tonight.

132
00:07:15.696 --> 00:07:17.306
Good to close up?

133
00:07:17.306 --> 00:07:19.700
I could get Ashanti to do it.

134
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.442
Ah. nah--gotta earn my keep.

135
00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:24.226
I hear the boss is a real jerk.

136
00:07:24.226 --> 00:07:25.619
Oh. yeah?

137
00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:30.493
- See you at home.
- Okay.

138
00:07:30.493 --> 00:07:32.408
<i>♪ I feel like dancing</i>

139
00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:41.548
Good night.

140
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.300
Um.

141
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.345
if you're looking for a gig.

142
00:07:56.345 --> 00:07:57.781
amateur night's tomorrow.

143
00:07:57.781 --> 00:08:00.349
I'm no amateur. Hartley.

144
00:08:00.349 --> 00:08:02.264
and I already have a gig...

145
00:08:02.264 --> 00:08:03.395
you.

146
00:08:20.848 --> 00:08:23.807
Aw. come on out. Hartley.

147
00:08:23.807 --> 00:08:26.157
I promise to make it quick.

148
00:08:26.157 --> 00:08:28.072
All you have to do is

149
00:08:28.072 --> 00:08:29.813
listen to the music.

150
00:08:36.864 --> 00:08:38.561
Mm.

151
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:42.609
Who are you. and what
the hell do you want?

152
00:08:42.609 --> 00:08:44.872
You can call me The Fiddler.

153
00:08:44.872 --> 00:08:46.526
and I'm here
to ruin your night.

154
00:09:13.596 --> 00:09:14.858
Why are you doing this?

155
00:09:14.858 --> 00:09:17.687
You have something I need.

156
00:09:21.735 --> 00:09:24.346
Hartley!

157
00:09:24.346 --> 00:09:25.869
Hartley.

158
00:09:28.437 --> 00:09:32.267
Tell your boss I'll be back.

159
00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:39.317
Hartley!

160
00:09:48.109 --> 00:09:49.414
It's okay.

161
00:09:49.414 --> 00:09:52.113
Just remember
you're doing the right thing.

162
00:09:55.507 --> 00:09:57.422
I sure hope so.

163
00:10:03.428 --> 00:10:06.344
All right.
Snow's ready.

164
00:10:06.344 --> 00:10:07.476
Excuse me.

165
00:10:28.845 --> 00:10:30.630
I never really got
to know her.

166
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.980
Well. we know
she's brave as hell.

167
00:10:35.112 --> 00:10:37.071
How long will this take?

168
00:10:37.071 --> 00:10:38.942
Oh. as long as it needs to.

169
00:10:38.942 --> 00:10:40.465
Hold on.

170
00:10:40.465 --> 00:10:42.685
The neural conductivity
readouts are surging.

171
00:10:42.685 --> 00:10:44.469
Mark. we got tachyon feedback.

172
00:10:44.469 --> 00:10:45.949
Mm-hmm.

173
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:48.386
Hold on.
Something's not right here.

174
00:10:58.353 --> 00:10:59.615
What the hell are you doing?

175
00:10:59.615 --> 00:11:00.921
Trying to save her life!

176
00:11:00.921 --> 00:11:02.357
You can't interrupt
this process!

177
00:11:02.357 --> 00:11:04.011
You have to get her
back inside right now!

178
00:11:04.011 --> 00:11:06.143
Mark!
Chester. what happened?

179
00:11:06.143 --> 00:11:07.971
I don't know.
All I did was provide

180
00:11:07.971 --> 00:11:10.539
a stable power source.
That wouldn't cause this.

181
00:11:10.539 --> 00:11:11.801
He didn't say
this would hurt.

182
00:11:11.801 --> 00:11:14.674
He just said
it would bring them back.

183
00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:15.936
Them?

184
00:11:17.502 --> 00:11:18.678
You mean Caitlin?

185
00:11:20.723 --> 00:11:22.943
No.

186
00:11:22.943 --> 00:11:25.336
She means Caitlin and Frost.

187
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.688
Mark. everything you've done
has been for Frost. hasn't it?

188
00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.515
That's why you
haven't mentioned her.

189
00:11:30.515 --> 00:11:31.734
This wasn't about Caitlin.

190
00:11:31.734 --> 00:11:32.822
This was
about bringing Frost back.

191
00:11:32.822 --> 00:11:34.084
wasn't it?

192
00:11:35.825 --> 00:11:37.000
Mark. wasn't it?

193
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.959
Cai--Caitlin wasn't supposed

194
00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:39.960
to come back alone. Barry.

195
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.744
They both were.

196
00:11:41.744 --> 00:11:43.006
God...

197
00:11:43.006 --> 00:11:44.312
Trying to bring
them both back.

198
00:11:44.312 --> 00:11:45.835
that must've caused
the malfunction.

199
00:11:45.835 --> 00:11:47.750
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

200
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.447
Why did you lie to us?

201
00:11:50.971 --> 00:11:53.669
'Cause I can't trust
any of you...

202
00:11:53.669 --> 00:11:55.976
you most of all. Barry.

203
00:11:55.976 --> 00:11:57.847
That's why we had to build
the CRC in secret

204
00:11:57.847 --> 00:11:59.066
in the first place.

205
00:11:59.066 --> 00:12:00.720
because Caitlin knew that you

206
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.851
would try to stop her again.

207
00:12:01.851 --> 00:12:03.070
Mark.

208
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.550
man. this--this isn't right.

209
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.770
I'm sorry. Team Flash.

210
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.467
Just because
you all gave up on Frost

211
00:12:09.467 --> 00:12:12.340
doesn't mean that I can.

212
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.994
I never will.

213
00:12:27.877 --> 00:12:29.009
Is that Mark?

214
00:12:29.009 --> 00:12:30.575
No. it's an intruder alert.

215
00:12:30.575 --> 00:12:32.577
The med lab's been breached.

216
00:12:32.577 --> 00:12:33.796
Stay here.

217
00:12:38.888 --> 00:12:40.672
- Hartley?
- Where's Caitlin?

218
00:12:40.672 --> 00:12:43.110
I need a doctor.
- She's away.

219
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.156
Soundwaves... short-circuiting
my heart's natural rhythm.

220
00:12:46.156 --> 00:12:47.679
How do I--
I mean--

221
00:12:47.679 --> 00:12:49.029
Use the sonic cuff.

222
00:12:49.029 --> 00:12:51.422
- Sonic?
- The bottom drawer!

223
00:12:51.422 --> 00:12:52.467
Bottom drawer!

224
00:12:54.817 --> 00:12:55.905
There.

225
00:12:57.037 --> 00:12:58.255
Are you good?

226
00:13:04.348 --> 00:13:06.481
You okay?
- Took you long enough. Allen.

227
00:13:06.481 --> 00:13:08.265
I'm sorry.
I mean. I didn't know--

228
00:13:08.265 --> 00:13:09.571
you said the bottom drawer.
It was in the top drawer.

229
00:13:09.571 --> 00:13:10.790
I didn't even know what you--

230
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.356
Never mind.
Let me rest.

231
00:13:12.356 --> 00:13:14.228
Oh. gosh.

232
00:13:14.228 --> 00:13:17.231
This arrythmia isn't
going away anytime soon.

233
00:13:17.231 --> 00:13:19.276
Cuff's a patch. not a cure.

234
00:13:20.147 --> 00:13:21.975
- Okay.
- Hartley?

235
00:13:21.975 --> 00:13:23.019
It's Hartley. yeah.
It's...

236
00:13:23.019 --> 00:13:24.020
How did you get in here.

237
00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.326
and what happened to you?

238
00:13:25.326 --> 00:13:27.894
- One. I used to work here...
- Great.

239
00:13:27.894 --> 00:13:30.287
And two. some musical psycho

240
00:13:30.287 --> 00:13:32.507
attacked me
with her murder violin--

241
00:13:32.507 --> 00:13:33.595
calls herself The Fiddler.

242
00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:36.859
Is this who attacked you?

243
00:13:36.859 --> 00:13:38.295
Her name is Izzy Bowen.

244
00:13:38.295 --> 00:13:40.820
only we were friends
the last time we met.

245
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.561
Oh. well. no need
to unfriend Izzy on my account.

246
00:13:43.561 --> 00:13:44.954
It's not her.

247
00:13:44.954 --> 00:13:46.913
Barry. that's two new Rogues
in two days.

248
00:13:46.913 --> 00:13:48.131
and now Mark
is lying to us too.

249
00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:49.393
Trouble in paradise?

250
00:13:49.393 --> 00:13:50.699
- Please.
- Don't worry about it.

251
00:13:50.699 --> 00:13:52.657
I'll handle Mark.

252
00:13:52.657 --> 00:13:53.876
Bored.

253
00:13:53.876 --> 00:13:56.444
Sleeping now.

254
00:14:06.715 --> 00:14:10.110
Your upgrade didn't work.

255
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.981
Don't get me wrong.

256
00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:14.679
I love the fiddle and all.

257
00:14:17.421 --> 00:14:19.206
<i>You failed me.</i>

258
00:14:19.206 --> 00:14:21.904
<i>This is the price.</i>

259
00:14:25.038 --> 00:14:27.736
<i>Failing is not an option.</i>

260
00:14:27.736 --> 00:14:29.869
<i>Now bring me what I want.</i>

261
00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:33.002
<i>or next time. you die.</i>

262
00:14:33.002 --> 00:14:36.223
<i>Am I clear?</i>

263
00:14:36.223 --> 00:14:37.528
Yes.

264
00:14:37.528 --> 00:14:40.009
very.

265
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:41.924
I'm sorry.

266
00:15:07.645 --> 00:15:09.212
Another round.

267
00:15:09.212 --> 00:15:11.911
You know what?
Just make it the whole bottle.

268
00:15:13.477 --> 00:15:15.436
It still
won't bring her back.

269
00:15:16.654 --> 00:15:18.918
I just wanna talk.

270
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:29.754
You're wasting your time.

271
00:15:29.754 --> 00:15:31.974
And you screwed up. Mark--

272
00:15:31.974 --> 00:15:33.062
badly.

273
00:15:33.062 --> 00:15:35.064
Yeah.

274
00:15:35.064 --> 00:15:36.848
I know why you did it.

275
00:15:36.848 --> 00:15:38.502
Okay.

276
00:15:38.502 --> 00:15:40.765
No. go ahead.
Enlighten me.

277
00:15:40.765 --> 00:15:43.420
Because you loved Frost

278
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.249
with all your heart.
You still do.

279
00:15:48.686 --> 00:15:50.862
Sometimes.
when we love someone like that.

280
00:15:50.862 --> 00:15:52.995
we do the wrong things

281
00:15:52.995 --> 00:15:55.476
for the right reasons.

282
00:15:58.087 --> 00:15:59.959
I know I have.

283
00:16:02.004 --> 00:16:04.398
Please.

284
00:16:04.398 --> 00:16:06.791
Are you saying
you're not mad at me anymore?

285
00:16:06.791 --> 00:16:09.098
No. I am.

286
00:16:09.098 --> 00:16:12.449
but I understand why you lied.

287
00:16:12.449 --> 00:16:14.974
But there's something you
need to understand now too:

288
00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:16.192
how we operate.

289
00:16:18.281 --> 00:16:22.155
You are a part
of this team now.

290
00:16:22.155 --> 00:16:25.245
and that means
we have your back.

291
00:16:25.245 --> 00:16:27.987
but you need to have ours.

292
00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.511
which also means no more

293
00:16:30.511 --> 00:16:32.339
going rogue.

294
00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.298
Mark...

295
00:16:36.952 --> 00:16:39.172
If you let us in.

296
00:16:39.172 --> 00:16:42.784
we work together.

297
00:16:42.784 --> 00:16:44.699
we can do the impossible.

298
00:16:46.918 --> 00:16:51.053
But we have to stick together.

299
00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.408
We have to go right now.

300
00:16:58.408 --> 00:16:59.627
- Go where?
- Right now.

301
00:16:59.627 --> 00:17:00.802
- Where?
- Come on.

302
00:17:00.802 --> 00:17:04.197
Is this. like.
one of those team things?

303
00:17:05.198 --> 00:17:06.547
<i>What do you mean
this was never gonna work?</i>

304
00:17:06.547 --> 00:17:09.158
I ran
a full diagnostic on the CRC.

305
00:17:09.158 --> 00:17:10.638
trying to figure out
what went wrong.

306
00:17:10.638 --> 00:17:13.162
and what I found was.
neural DNA

307
00:17:13.162 --> 00:17:15.686
could never unlock
Frost's consciousness.

308
00:17:15.686 --> 00:17:19.386
We need endogenous neural
imprints to make this work.

309
00:17:19.386 --> 00:17:21.170
Okay?

310
00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.606
But you're talking
about a literal map

311
00:17:22.606 --> 00:17:23.955
of Caitlin's mind.
Where are we gonna find

312
00:17:23.955 --> 00:17:25.218
something like that?

313
00:17:25.218 --> 00:17:27.655
Thomas Snow.

314
00:17:27.655 --> 00:17:29.526
Caitlin's dad?

315
00:17:29.526 --> 00:17:31.006
He's dead.

316
00:17:31.006 --> 00:17:32.529
No. Iris is right.

317
00:17:32.529 --> 00:17:34.705
Thomas Snow attached
Frost's consciousness

318
00:17:34.705 --> 00:17:36.707
to Caitlin
when she was a child.

319
00:17:36.707 --> 00:17:38.492
Caitlin downloaded
everything she could find

320
00:17:38.492 --> 00:17:40.407
from his digital files
at her apartment.

321
00:17:40.407 --> 00:17:42.191
said that the hard copies
and all the rest are in storage

322
00:17:42.191 --> 00:17:44.715
at Tannhauser Labs.
Now. it's a lot. but...

323
00:17:44.715 --> 00:17:46.065
Meet me at Caitlin's.

324
00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:48.545
I'll check in
with Carla at Tannhauser.

325
00:17:48.545 --> 00:17:51.200
Chester. you and Mark
get to work on the CRC.

326
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.333
Once we find
what we're looking for.

327
00:17:53.333 --> 00:17:55.552
we're gonna bring back Caitlin

328
00:17:55.552 --> 00:17:57.206
and Frost.

329
00:18:09.523 --> 00:18:11.873
<i>I entered
the harmonics already.</i>

330
00:18:13.135 --> 00:18:15.094
<i>Now. come on.
I know this.</i>

331
00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:16.138
<i>Ow.</i>

332
00:18:16.138 --> 00:18:17.444
<i>Frak.</i>

333
00:18:23.145 --> 00:18:24.755
Damn it.

334
00:18:24.755 --> 00:18:26.975
Why aren't you working?

335
00:18:26.975 --> 00:18:28.411
Are you okay?

336
00:18:28.411 --> 00:18:32.067
Well. you're obviously
the other Snow sister.

337
00:18:33.024 --> 00:18:36.463
Actually. I'm kind of busy.
if you don't mind.

338
00:18:36.463 --> 00:18:37.855
What are you working on?

339
00:18:37.855 --> 00:18:40.597
My sonic gauntlets--

340
00:18:40.597 --> 00:18:41.772
why do you care?

341
00:18:41.772 --> 00:18:44.166
Oh. I don't--
about your gauntlets.

342
00:18:44.166 --> 00:18:46.299
You just seemed like
you were in pain.

343
00:18:46.299 --> 00:18:48.214
What's wrong?

344
00:18:48.214 --> 00:18:50.346
I have a dangerously erratic
heart rate

345
00:18:50.346 --> 00:18:52.566
due to some punk witch

346
00:18:52.566 --> 00:18:55.395
who caught me
with my guard down.

347
00:18:55.395 --> 00:18:58.224
But that won't be
a problem next time.

348
00:18:58.224 --> 00:19:00.182
because I'm boosting
my gauntlet's efficiency

349
00:19:00.182 --> 00:19:02.141
by 400%.

350
00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:03.446
Wow.

351
00:19:03.446 --> 00:19:04.665
Why?

352
00:19:04.665 --> 00:19:06.449
You know. actually.
it doesn't matter.

353
00:19:06.449 --> 00:19:10.888
If you could just. please.
go away or something...

354
00:19:13.804 --> 00:19:15.197
Okay.

355
00:19:15.197 --> 00:19:16.807
I'm gonna make this easy.

356
00:19:16.807 --> 00:19:18.200
Do you have
any of Caitlin Snow's

357
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.288
medical knowledge?

358
00:19:19.288 --> 00:19:20.463
- No.
- No. okay.

359
00:19:20.463 --> 00:19:22.378
um. can you shoot ice

360
00:19:22.378 --> 00:19:24.467
from your hands or eyes?

361
00:19:24.467 --> 00:19:26.208
Either is acceptable.

362
00:19:26.208 --> 00:19:29.342
- No.
- No--then you can't help me.

363
00:19:29.342 --> 00:19:31.866
and therefore. you are useless!

364
00:19:31.866 --> 00:19:34.564
So please leave me alo--

365
00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.091
You shouldn't be working
right now

366
00:19:40.091 --> 00:19:42.137
or angrily asking people
weird questions.

367
00:19:42.137 --> 00:19:45.053
It's disturbing.

368
00:19:45.053 --> 00:19:47.664
I have to finish this.

369
00:19:47.664 --> 00:19:50.406
Are you scared
that person will find you?

370
00:19:50.406 --> 00:19:52.408
Because I'm sure Barry
and the others have--

371
00:19:52.408 --> 00:19:54.671
I have to get out of here. okay?

372
00:19:54.671 --> 00:19:55.716
If I don't...

373
00:19:58.632 --> 00:20:01.069
You're not afraid
of getting hurt.

374
00:20:01.069 --> 00:20:04.594
You're afraid of someone else
getting hurt.

375
00:20:04.594 --> 00:20:07.249
You think they're in danger.

376
00:20:07.249 --> 00:20:09.338
And that is why

377
00:20:09.338 --> 00:20:12.254
I have to finish these:

378
00:20:12.254 --> 00:20:14.213
so I can keep him safe...

379
00:20:15.823 --> 00:20:18.173
The only way that I can.

380
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.612
You're going
to kill the punk witch?

381
00:20:24.397 --> 00:20:26.486
Oh. no.
Killing is wrong.

382
00:20:27.835 --> 00:20:30.751
And Central City has
more meta-violence per capita

383
00:20:30.751 --> 00:20:32.840
than any other city
in the world.

384
00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.364
You're not a killer.
I can tell.

385
00:20:35.364 --> 00:20:36.974
You don't know me.

386
00:20:36.974 --> 00:20:39.368
Actually--and I can say this
quite truthfully--

387
00:20:39.368 --> 00:20:41.718
I think I know you
better than I know myself.

388
00:20:43.459 --> 00:20:45.374
I used to be
a meta-criminal.

389
00:20:45.374 --> 00:20:47.550
a Rogue. as they say.

390
00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.726
I used to hurt people
all the time.

391
00:20:49.726 --> 00:20:51.250
and I enjoyed it.

392
00:20:52.381 --> 00:20:53.904
What changed you?

393
00:20:53.904 --> 00:20:57.168
Oh. Roderick. okay?

394
00:20:57.168 --> 00:20:59.214
Roderick.

395
00:20:59.214 --> 00:21:02.261
You changed to keep him safe?

396
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:04.263
That's beautiful.

397
00:21:05.481 --> 00:21:08.310
But that's not real change.

398
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.007
is it?

399
00:21:10.007 --> 00:21:11.879
Deciding to change
for the person you love

400
00:21:11.879 --> 00:21:15.186
doesn't mean you've decided
who you wanna be.

401
00:21:15.186 --> 00:21:18.929
That's a choice you still
have to make for yourself.

402
00:21:18.929 --> 00:21:20.017
isn't it?

403
00:21:47.088 --> 00:21:48.132
Please tell me

404
00:21:48.132 --> 00:21:49.786
you found something.

405
00:21:49.786 --> 00:21:52.093
We have to get
Caitlin and Frost back.

406
00:21:53.399 --> 00:21:54.574
We can't.

407
00:22:03.452 --> 00:22:04.584
Is this really true?

408
00:22:04.584 --> 00:22:07.195
I read it a dozen times.

409
00:22:07.195 --> 00:22:08.936
In his original experiment.

410
00:22:08.936 --> 00:22:11.808
Thomas Snow tried to create
a Caitlin 2.0.

411
00:22:11.808 --> 00:22:13.854
one that would be
immune to ALS.

412
00:22:13.854 --> 00:22:16.160
but instead.
he created a daughter

413
00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.685
with two mixed consciousnesses.

414
00:22:18.685 --> 00:22:20.339
and when he tried
to reverse it.

415
00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:21.818
he found out

416
00:22:21.818 --> 00:22:25.387
the process would kill
one of them.

417
00:22:25.387 --> 00:22:27.476
That's why Thomas
never built his own CRC.

418
00:22:27.476 --> 00:22:30.653
because he loved
both Caitlin and Frost.

419
00:22:30.653 --> 00:22:34.135
He couldn't bear
to lose either of them.

420
00:22:34.135 --> 00:22:36.485
Just like us.

421
00:22:36.485 --> 00:22:39.445
Barry. if Snow goes
into that machine.

422
00:22:39.445 --> 00:22:42.796
and only Caitlin or Frost
can come back...

423
00:22:42.796 --> 00:22:44.493
We're gonna have to choose

424
00:22:44.493 --> 00:22:45.973
who to bring back.

425
00:22:57.898 --> 00:22:59.595
You know. the last thing
Caitlin said to me

426
00:22:59.595 --> 00:23:02.032
was that she'd never stop
trying to bring back Frost.

427
00:23:02.032 --> 00:23:03.860
We need to honor her
by honoring her plan.

428
00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.906
Mark. we're all pretty clear

429
00:23:05.906 --> 00:23:08.735
on your opinion.
I wanna hear everybody else's.

430
00:23:10.519 --> 00:23:12.695
Okay.

431
00:23:12.695 --> 00:23:15.132
I vote to bring back Frost.

432
00:23:15.132 --> 00:23:16.569
Mark's right.

433
00:23:16.569 --> 00:23:18.135
Caitlin chose for us.

434
00:23:18.135 --> 00:23:22.966
This was her plan.
so choosing Frost honors her.

435
00:23:22.966 --> 00:23:24.490
Right. Chuck?

436
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.275
Chuck?

437
00:23:27.275 --> 00:23:29.364
Um.

438
00:23:29.364 --> 00:23:30.365
sorry. but. uh.

439
00:23:30.365 --> 00:23:31.888
but no.

440
00:23:31.888 --> 00:23:34.369
Allegra. look. when Deathstorm
brought my dad back.

441
00:23:34.369 --> 00:23:36.240
it taught me one thing:

442
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.199
that resurrecting the dead

443
00:23:38.199 --> 00:23:39.679
is unnatural.

444
00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.117
Now. I don't wanna choose.

445
00:23:43.117 --> 00:23:45.554
but if I have to.

446
00:23:45.554 --> 00:23:47.469
I'd choose Caitlin.

447
00:23:47.469 --> 00:23:50.211
'cause when I run
through the science.

448
00:23:50.211 --> 00:23:52.735
it's what makes
the most sense to me.

449
00:23:53.954 --> 00:23:55.608
Mm.

450
00:23:55.608 --> 00:23:57.436
it's two to one.

451
00:23:59.002 --> 00:24:00.613
Let me guess:

452
00:24:00.613 --> 00:24:02.310
you're with Chester. right?

453
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:06.096
That way. your super-hubby
can tip the scales to Caitlin.

454
00:24:06.096 --> 00:24:08.664
Uh. no. I choose Frost.

455
00:24:10.927 --> 00:24:13.452
I have my reasons.
but that's how I feel.

456
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:18.761
Well. it's three to one.

457
00:24:18.761 --> 00:24:20.981
I just need more time
to think about it.

458
00:24:20.981 --> 00:24:24.506
Well. think about it
all you want. boss man.

459
00:24:24.506 --> 00:24:27.204
but in eight hours.
I'm doing this.

460
00:24:27.204 --> 00:24:29.076
with or without you.
and if you try to stop me.

461
00:24:29.076 --> 00:24:32.296
you'll have no one but yourself
to blame for the fallout.

462
00:24:32.296 --> 00:24:34.603
He can blame me.

463
00:24:39.521 --> 00:24:42.742
You all are a family.

464
00:24:42.742 --> 00:24:45.484
Now you're being torn apart.
and it's all my fault?

465
00:24:47.442 --> 00:24:48.965
I wish I'd never been born.

466
00:25:13.729 --> 00:25:15.514
Worst day ever.

467
00:25:18.255 --> 00:25:20.736
Snow is wrong.

468
00:25:20.736 --> 00:25:22.259
It's not her fault.

469
00:25:22.259 --> 00:25:23.739
It's mine.

470
00:25:25.828 --> 00:25:27.482
The last thing
I said to Caitlin

471
00:25:27.482 --> 00:25:30.703
before I destroyed her lab was.

472
00:25:30.703 --> 00:25:33.532
"I'm sorry."

473
00:25:35.664 --> 00:25:37.623
The truth is. I wasn't.

474
00:25:40.016 --> 00:25:41.888
Barry. the reason
that I chose Frost

475
00:25:41.888 --> 00:25:44.586
was because I didn't choose her
the first time.

476
00:25:44.586 --> 00:25:47.633
when I had the chance.

477
00:25:47.633 --> 00:25:50.940
That's why I chose
to bring Frost back:

478
00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.552
because I didn't choose her
when she was alive.

479
00:25:55.641 --> 00:25:56.685
What is it?

480
00:25:56.685 --> 00:25:58.252
The moment Caitlin stepped

481
00:25:58.252 --> 00:26:01.864
into the CRC.
she made her own choice

482
00:26:01.864 --> 00:26:03.649
about what she wanted.

483
00:26:03.649 --> 00:26:05.346
who she wanted to be.

484
00:26:05.346 --> 00:26:06.390
Mm-hmm.

485
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:07.566
And what if we've been

486
00:26:07.566 --> 00:26:09.568
thinking about this all wrong?

487
00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.659
I know what we need to do.

488
00:26:39.554 --> 00:26:41.251
Hello.

489
00:26:41.251 --> 00:26:45.212
It's. uh. Snow. right?

490
00:26:45.212 --> 00:26:46.779
Cecile.

491
00:26:46.779 --> 00:26:47.954
meta-human attorney

492
00:26:47.954 --> 00:26:50.260
and meta-human superhero.

493
00:26:51.566 --> 00:26:54.177
Mark told me all about you.

494
00:26:55.962 --> 00:26:57.659
You enjoying the weather?

495
00:26:57.659 --> 00:26:59.792
I love the rain.

496
00:26:59.792 --> 00:27:01.445
I love all of nature.

497
00:27:01.445 --> 00:27:04.100
It just--it makes me feel so

498
00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.624
at peace.

499
00:27:07.495 --> 00:27:08.975
Yeah. I can see that.

500
00:27:08.975 --> 00:27:12.108
It's because everything
in nature has a purpose...

501
00:27:12.108 --> 00:27:13.675
just like you.
You have a purpose.

502
00:27:13.675 --> 00:27:15.285
You help people.

503
00:27:15.285 --> 00:27:17.766
I just...

504
00:27:17.766 --> 00:27:20.203
I wish I knew
what my purpose was.

505
00:27:22.162 --> 00:27:23.598
It's strange.

506
00:27:23.598 --> 00:27:28.385
Right now. I feel so connected
to all living things.

507
00:27:28.385 --> 00:27:31.780
and yet so disconnected

508
00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.216
and alone.

509
00:27:33.216 --> 00:27:34.609
Do you know that
you're the first person

510
00:27:34.609 --> 00:27:37.264
whose feelings I can't read?

511
00:27:37.264 --> 00:27:38.918
Usually.

512
00:27:38.918 --> 00:27:40.789
ooh. that is something
I'd be worried about.

513
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:42.399
but I don't know.

514
00:27:44.271 --> 00:27:46.577
Not this time.

515
00:27:46.577 --> 00:27:50.103
Somehow.
you just seem like a friend.

516
00:27:51.713 --> 00:27:52.801
Then let's be.

517
00:27:52.801 --> 00:27:55.325
Friends.

518
00:27:55.325 --> 00:27:56.500
Was that funny?

519
00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.937
Am I a funny person?

520
00:27:57.937 --> 00:27:59.765
That would be nice.

521
00:27:59.765 --> 00:28:00.809
You are very genuine.

522
00:28:00.809 --> 00:28:02.550
and that is rare.

523
00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:04.073
Thanks.

524
00:28:04.073 --> 00:28:07.816
So I heard about
what the rest of the team

525
00:28:07.816 --> 00:28:10.514
was voting on.

526
00:28:10.514 --> 00:28:12.560
I gotta tell ya.

527
00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.042
I honestly don't know
how I would've voted.

528
00:28:16.042 --> 00:28:19.132
had I been there. or Joe.

529
00:28:19.132 --> 00:28:21.525
So...

530
00:28:21.525 --> 00:28:24.224
I'm gonna ask you a question
that I usually don't have to.

531
00:28:26.748 --> 00:28:29.142
How are you feeling right now?

532
00:28:29.142 --> 00:28:30.796
Even though
my entire existence

533
00:28:30.796 --> 00:28:32.406
is a mystery.

534
00:28:32.406 --> 00:28:35.365
one. whoever I am.

535
00:28:35.365 --> 00:28:37.672
I like myself.

536
00:28:37.672 --> 00:28:38.891
and two...

537
00:28:40.544 --> 00:28:43.199
I don't wanna go back
inside that metal box.

538
00:28:44.418 --> 00:28:46.594
And now I'm afraid
of the decision

539
00:28:46.594 --> 00:28:48.291
the team will make.

540
00:28:50.598 --> 00:28:54.471
You should make
the decision for yourself.

541
00:28:54.471 --> 00:28:56.604
- Really?
- Yeah.

542
00:28:56.604 --> 00:28:58.998
We looked
at Thomas' original files

543
00:28:58.998 --> 00:29:00.651
on Frost and Snow.

544
00:29:00.651 --> 00:29:03.132
When Frost was created.

545
00:29:03.132 --> 00:29:06.135
Thomas didn't try to decide
who his daughter should be.

546
00:29:06.135 --> 00:29:09.225
He took a step back.
and he let 'em figure it out.

547
00:29:09.225 --> 00:29:13.621
So using the CRC
and choosing who you should be.

548
00:29:13.621 --> 00:29:15.449
that's not our choice to make.

549
00:29:15.449 --> 00:29:17.886
Only you can decide
who you're gonna be.

550
00:29:19.714 --> 00:29:20.933
Oh.

551
00:29:20.933 --> 00:29:22.978
Ooh. okay.
this is what we're doing.

552
00:29:25.372 --> 00:29:26.416
Okay. my turn.

553
00:29:26.416 --> 00:29:27.678
Oh. hi!

554
00:29:27.678 --> 00:29:30.507
So you've made a decision?

555
00:29:30.507 --> 00:29:31.813
Not even.

556
00:29:31.813 --> 00:29:33.641
but whatever decision I make.

557
00:29:33.641 --> 00:29:34.816
it'll be mine...

558
00:29:34.816 --> 00:29:36.687
all mine.

559
00:29:46.654 --> 00:29:48.003
What is it?

560
00:29:48.003 --> 00:29:49.439
It was a massive sonic attack downtown.

561
00:29:49.439 --> 00:29:50.832
It looks like
our Fiddler friend is back

562
00:29:50.832 --> 00:29:52.094
and ready to rumble.

563
00:29:52.094 --> 00:29:53.530
Wait. that's
Hartley's Krakatoa Club.

564
00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.798
He's gone after The Fiddler.

565
00:29:59.798 --> 00:30:02.191
If he's still hurt.
why didn't he ask for help?

566
00:30:02.191 --> 00:30:04.715
He doesn't want your help.

567
00:30:04.715 --> 00:30:08.284
He finally made his choice.

568
00:30:18.033 --> 00:30:19.600
Does it look like I'm playing?

569
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:24.518
For the last time.
where is Hartley Rathaway?

570
00:30:35.616 --> 00:30:38.271
Please...
- Let him go.

571
00:30:38.271 --> 00:30:40.229
Hartley.

572
00:30:40.229 --> 00:30:42.623
I knew. if I put
the squeeze on your squeeze.

573
00:30:42.623 --> 00:30:45.017
you'd show up sooner or later.

574
00:30:45.017 --> 00:30:47.758
Just in time. too. 'cause
I was starting to get bored

575
00:30:47.758 --> 00:30:49.760
of torturing your employees.

576
00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.763
She killed them all...

577
00:30:52.763 --> 00:30:53.939
the whole crew.

578
00:30:53.939 --> 00:30:56.376
Did I mention

579
00:30:56.376 --> 00:30:59.335
that there are fates
worse than death?

580
00:31:07.213 --> 00:31:08.910
No!

581
00:31:21.749 --> 00:31:23.751
It's over. Fiddler.

582
00:31:23.751 --> 00:31:25.492
You're powerless

583
00:31:25.492 --> 00:31:27.363
and outnumbered.

584
00:31:31.585 --> 00:31:33.021
Oh. Flash.

585
00:31:33.021 --> 00:31:35.806
You came to my show.

586
00:31:35.806 --> 00:31:39.985
See. instruments
are just a tool.

587
00:31:42.552 --> 00:31:46.208
A real artist uses
what's inside them.

588
00:32:06.272 --> 00:32:07.838
Time to get what I came for.

589
00:32:14.367 --> 00:32:17.109
How do you like my upgrade?

590
00:32:17.109 --> 00:32:19.415
Don't.
Stop.

591
00:32:19.415 --> 00:32:21.635
Snow told me what you said.

592
00:32:21.635 --> 00:32:22.941
You don't have to do this.

593
00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:24.725
You can still choose
another way.

594
00:32:24.725 --> 00:32:26.945
It's too late.

595
00:32:26.945 --> 00:32:30.078
Roderick is dead
because of her.

596
00:32:30.078 --> 00:32:31.514
I have nothing to live for now.

597
00:32:31.514 --> 00:32:33.081
Yes. you do.

598
00:32:33.081 --> 00:32:34.082
I'll show you.

599
00:32:55.364 --> 00:32:57.018
The Fiddler didn't kill them.

600
00:32:57.018 --> 00:33:00.108
They're trapped
in a vibrational phase.

601
00:33:00.108 --> 00:33:01.980
But they need your gauntlets
to get them out.

602
00:33:31.226 --> 00:33:33.663
You made the right choice.

603
00:33:33.663 --> 00:33:37.276
And reset things
in the process.

604
00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:41.715
Hey.

605
00:33:44.196 --> 00:33:46.546
You saved
a lot of lives today.

606
00:33:46.546 --> 00:33:49.244
What do you wanna do
with The Fiddler?

607
00:33:49.244 --> 00:33:50.593
You figure it out.

608
00:33:50.593 --> 00:33:51.681
I'm busy.

609
00:33:56.251 --> 00:33:58.210
<i>Aw. look at him.</i>

610
00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:00.386
<i>wandering around
like a lost puppy.</i>

611
00:34:00.386 --> 00:34:01.561
<i>You all right there?</i>

612
00:34:01.561 --> 00:34:03.911
No.
We got what we came for.

613
00:34:03.911 --> 00:34:05.391
Now let's
get the hell out of here.

614
00:34:10.091 --> 00:34:11.310
It was Mercer.

615
00:34:13.007 --> 00:34:14.400
He took The Fiddler.

616
00:34:17.751 --> 00:34:20.145
And my gauntlets.

617
00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:29.806
Her name is Andrea Wozzeck.

618
00:34:29.806 --> 00:34:32.070
Turns out she's also working
with Owen Mercer.

619
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:34.420
Why is anyone's guess.

620
00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.813
Supervillain team-up. great.

621
00:34:36.813 --> 00:34:39.860
So do we know why they want
Hartley's gauntlet?

622
00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.557
- Do we care?
- Uh...

623
00:34:41.557 --> 00:34:45.083
Look. the only thing that
I'm concerned about right now

624
00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:47.128
is. "What did you decide?"

625
00:34:47.128 --> 00:34:49.435
I didn't decide anything.

626
00:34:49.435 --> 00:34:50.436
Snow did.

627
00:34:50.436 --> 00:34:52.220
She already told
everybody else.

628
00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:55.223
I guess now it's time
she tells you too.

629
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:58.618
What is...

630
00:34:58.618 --> 00:35:02.970
I know that this has
been difficult for you.

631
00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:07.888
and that whatever decision
I make will affect you a lot.

632
00:35:07.888 --> 00:35:10.020
but not as much
as it will affect me.

633
00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.588
This is my fate.

634
00:35:12.588 --> 00:35:14.416
my future.

635
00:35:14.416 --> 00:35:17.071
my life.

636
00:35:17.071 --> 00:35:19.769
I'm not going back
inside the CRC.

637
00:35:19.769 --> 00:35:21.858
What?

638
00:35:21.858 --> 00:35:24.122
I'm gonna choose my own path

639
00:35:24.122 --> 00:35:27.168
and be my own person.

640
00:35:27.168 --> 00:35:30.128
whoever that ends up being.

641
00:35:32.652 --> 00:35:34.349
That's it?

642
00:35:34.349 --> 00:35:36.177
What. I'm just supposed
to forget about Frost

643
00:35:36.177 --> 00:35:39.267
and accept this?
- Yes.

644
00:35:39.267 --> 00:35:41.574
because I didn't choose this.

645
00:35:41.574 --> 00:35:42.488
Caitlin did

646
00:35:42.488 --> 00:35:44.881
when she created a person

647
00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:46.796
with feelings

648
00:35:46.796 --> 00:35:49.147
and free will.

649
00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:50.191
and I won't give that up

650
00:35:50.191 --> 00:35:51.801
to become someone I'm not.

651
00:35:51.801 --> 00:35:54.195
Please. you don't
even have your own name.

652
00:35:54.195 --> 00:35:56.806
Actually. I do.

653
00:35:56.806 --> 00:35:59.418
I found out today
that my father always dreamed

654
00:35:59.418 --> 00:36:00.984
of creating something

655
00:36:00.984 --> 00:36:03.987
or someone new.

656
00:36:03.987 --> 00:36:06.990
and he called her Khione.

657
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:09.993
But science is like nature.

658
00:36:09.993 --> 00:36:11.821
It can be cruel

659
00:36:11.821 --> 00:36:14.215
as well as beautiful.

660
00:36:14.215 --> 00:36:16.609
Either way.
we can't control it.

661
00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:22.005
So I know
Caitlin and Frost are gone.

662
00:36:22.005 --> 00:36:24.312
and we can mourn the flowers

663
00:36:24.312 --> 00:36:26.923
that have fallen from the vine.

664
00:36:26.923 --> 00:36:29.099
but we can't ask a new bloom

665
00:36:29.099 --> 00:36:32.668
to give up its place
in exchange.

666
00:36:32.668 --> 00:36:35.367
I hope you can accept that.

667
00:36:35.367 --> 00:36:38.152
I hope you can accept me.

668
00:36:38.152 --> 00:36:39.806
'cause I'd like to live

669
00:36:39.806 --> 00:36:42.243
and grow with all of you.

670
00:36:42.243 --> 00:36:43.723
We want that too.

671
00:36:45.551 --> 00:36:47.857
You need to get inside
right now. okay?

672
00:36:47.857 --> 00:36:51.426
That was always the plan.
That was our plan.

673
00:36:51.426 --> 00:36:53.080
That was Caitlin's plan!

674
00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.300
Plans change.

675
00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:56.301
No!

676
00:37:12.926 --> 00:37:16.016
Do you realize
what you've just done?

677
00:37:16.016 --> 00:37:18.148
Yeah.

678
00:37:18.148 --> 00:37:19.367
I just helped a new friend.

679
00:37:26.156 --> 00:37:29.290
The next time
that I see you.

680
00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:31.249
I am taking you down.

681
00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:33.251
Mark...

682
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:42.390
Looks like
you're back to 100%.

683
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:44.653
It stopped raining.

684
00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.440
Is Mark gonna be okay?

685
00:37:49.919 --> 00:37:51.312
I hope so.

686
00:38:04.543 --> 00:38:08.373
Well. the sun is shining.

687
00:38:08.373 --> 00:38:09.591
and we made it
through the week.

688
00:38:09.591 --> 00:38:11.941
Mm. and in one piece at that.

689
00:38:11.941 --> 00:38:14.161
- Mm-hmm.
- And even though it's hard

690
00:38:14.161 --> 00:38:15.467
to believe that we'll never see

691
00:38:15.467 --> 00:38:16.946
Caitlin or Frost again.

692
00:38:16.946 --> 00:38:20.689
I am happy for Khione.

693
00:38:20.689 --> 00:38:23.866
Yeah. I know what you mean.

694
00:38:23.866 --> 00:38:26.826
That's why I keep
telling myself that

695
00:38:26.826 --> 00:38:30.612
Frost chose to become Hellfrost
and fight Deathstorm.

696
00:38:30.612 --> 00:38:33.659
just like Caitlin chose
to go into the CRC.

697
00:38:33.659 --> 00:38:37.140
and now Khione's
made her choice too.

698
00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.620
Yeah.

699
00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:40.230
Is it crazy to think that this

700
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:41.493
new version of Caitlin is what

701
00:38:41.493 --> 00:38:44.539
she would've wanted all along?

702
00:38:44.539 --> 00:38:47.499
No. not at all.

703
00:38:47.499 --> 00:38:50.110
I think she'd like her.

704
00:38:52.721 --> 00:38:54.375
So?

705
00:38:54.375 --> 00:38:55.942
Mm?

706
00:38:55.942 --> 00:38:58.553
Got any weekend plans?

707
00:38:58.553 --> 00:39:01.469
Actually. I was thinking

708
00:39:01.469 --> 00:39:03.384
we could take in a geyser.
