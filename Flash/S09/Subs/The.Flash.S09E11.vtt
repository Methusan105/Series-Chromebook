1
00:00:28.593 --> 00:00:29.594
Uh...

2
00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.122
can I help you?

3
00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:38.647
This is gonna sound insane.

4
00:00:38.647 --> 00:00:40.170
but I. um--

5
00:00:44.348 --> 00:00:46.611
I was just in an accident.

6
00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:49.832
And I found this file.

7
00:00:49.832 --> 00:00:51.877
but what I saw inside

8
00:00:54.358 --> 00:00:57.231
doesn't make any sense.

9
00:01:05.935 --> 00:01:07.458
Oh. my God.

10
00:01:15.205 --> 00:01:16.989
We need to talk.

11
00:01:51.502 --> 00:01:53.025
Six hours
and 52 minutes ago.

12
00:01:53.025 --> 00:01:55.027
Barry vanished
right in front of me.

13
00:01:55.027 --> 00:01:56.507
We don't know where he is.
if he's in danger.

14
00:01:56.507 --> 00:01:57.769
or why he's not back yet.

15
00:01:57.769 --> 00:01:59.031
We don't know anything.

16
00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:00.685
Whether he's still alive!

17
00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:02.557
Since then.
I've doubled back to the loft

18
00:02:02.557 --> 00:02:04.733
to look for evidence
at the scene of the crime.

19
00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:09.085
Picked up some weird energy
signature from the air.

20
00:02:09.085 --> 00:02:12.132
trace amounts
of a radioactive isotope

21
00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:15.178
of cobalt.

22
00:02:15.178 --> 00:02:18.268
Did anyone else just
get a bad feeling?

23
00:02:18.268 --> 00:02:20.314
I-- I don't get it.

24
00:02:20.314 --> 00:02:22.620
What could leave behind
radiation like that?

25
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.405
I'm not sure.

26
00:02:24.405 --> 00:02:28.713
But isotopes like this don't
just occur spontaneously.

27
00:02:28.713 --> 00:02:32.848
Barry's disappearance
wasn't an accident.

28
00:02:32.848 --> 00:02:36.939
He was taken. which
is even more terrifying.

29
00:02:40.682 --> 00:02:45.861
It sounds like y'all
could use some help.

30
00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:47.167
Mark!

31
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:51.345
Welcome back. man.

32
00:02:51.345 --> 00:02:52.694
It's so good to see you.

33
00:02:52.694 --> 00:02:54.435
I was just thinking
about you!

34
00:02:54.435 --> 00:02:55.827
Where have you been?

35
00:02:55.827 --> 00:02:58.265
Tundi. the Arctic.
Corto Maltese.

36
00:02:58.265 --> 00:03:00.571
volunteering at a few
different research facilities.

37
00:03:00.571 --> 00:03:01.920
What are you doing back here?

38
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.096
I called for him.

39
00:03:04.096 --> 00:03:06.403
You knew how to get
in touch with Mark?

40
00:03:06.403 --> 00:03:10.146
A few months after I left.
I reached back out to Cecile.

41
00:03:10.146 --> 00:03:12.583
Guess I just needed
a friend to talk to.

42
00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:14.629
Khione. honey. I'm so sorry
that I couldn't tell you.

43
00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:20.548
But Mark wanted some space.
and he asked me to stay quiet.

44
00:03:20.548 --> 00:03:21.984
I'm sorry. too.

45
00:03:21.984 --> 00:03:24.073
But I am done keeping
my distance.

46
00:03:24.073 --> 00:03:25.335
especially now.

47
00:03:30.035 --> 00:03:32.386
Barry never gave up
on me. you know.

48
00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:35.476
even when I was
at my lowest point.

49
00:03:35.476 --> 00:03:37.217
So I'm not ready
to give up on him.

50
00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:41.351
and I do not think that
any of you are either.

51
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:43.571
I can try resetting
our satellites to scan

52
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:45.137
for the cobalt isotope.

53
00:03:45.137 --> 00:03:46.574
And I can call Cisco
at ARGUS.

54
00:03:46.574 --> 00:03:48.053
see if maybe they've heard anything.

55
00:03:48.053 --> 00:03:49.881
I'm gonna go to
the office and search

56
00:03:49.881 --> 00:03:53.102
the database for anything
about cobalt radiation.

57
00:03:53.102 --> 00:03:54.582
I'll come with.

58
00:03:54.582 --> 00:03:55.974
And Khione and I
can recheck the loft

59
00:03:55.974 --> 00:03:57.498
and surrounding areas.

60
00:03:57.498 --> 00:03:59.369
We'll make sure
we didn't miss anything.

61
00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:03.199
Wherever Barry is.
we're gonna find him.

62
00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:04.287
I know it.

63
00:04:11.642 --> 00:04:14.950
Hey. I found some more files
that we can check out.

64
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.560
You okay?
What's wrong?

65
00:04:19.694 --> 00:04:24.089
I was searching for other
unexplained disappearances

66
00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:27.745
in the database. and I came
across this old draft.

67
00:04:27.745 --> 00:04:31.575
I thought I deleted it.
but I guess it was backed up.

68
00:04:34.186 --> 00:04:37.668
Hey. Barry's survived Crisis.

69
00:04:37.668 --> 00:04:40.192
and he's gonna survive this. too.

70
00:04:40.192 --> 00:04:43.195
You know. when we first met
Nora. she was from a timeline

71
00:04:43.195 --> 00:04:47.287
where Barry did vanish
in Crisis.

72
00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:51.073
So she grew up
without a father.

73
00:04:51.073 --> 00:04:52.727
Living with the weight
of that pain.

74
00:04:52.727 --> 00:04:56.383
I thought that
this time around.

75
00:04:56.383 --> 00:04:59.211
we would give her
a better life.

76
00:04:59.211 --> 00:05:01.736
one that she deserves...

77
00:05:01.736 --> 00:05:06.349
together.

78
00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.264
But someone's trying
to pull us apart

79
00:05:08.264 --> 00:05:11.136
so that Barry won't be here
for a second time.

80
00:05:14.183 --> 00:05:16.316
It's like my worst nightmare
is coming true.

81
00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:19.971
And I just--

82
00:05:19.971 --> 00:05:22.409
I feel powerless to stop it.

83
00:05:27.283 --> 00:05:31.331
Do you remember
when I first saw that article?

84
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:35.160
I was just some smart-mouth kid
with a record.

85
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.599
But Iris. you took me
under your wing.

86
00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.429
You taught me to be
a reporter and a leader.

87
00:05:45.736 --> 00:05:52.134
So let me help you
and be there for you

88
00:05:52.134 --> 00:05:56.486
like you've been there for me.

89
00:05:56.486 --> 00:06:01.143
And I can start by grabbing
you some tea.

90
00:06:01.143 --> 00:06:03.014
Chamomile. right boss?

91
00:06:03.014 --> 00:06:05.930
Yeah.

92
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.758
- Be right back.
- Thanks.

93
00:06:18.943 --> 00:06:21.206
Oh. hey!

94
00:06:21.206 --> 00:06:24.384
What are you--

95
00:06:42.663 --> 00:06:43.707
We gotta shut that thing.

96
00:06:43.707 --> 00:06:45.361
Get everybody out of here!

97
00:06:45.361 --> 00:06:47.972
Come on. people. move!

98
00:06:47.972 --> 00:06:49.278
What's happening?

99
00:06:49.278 --> 00:06:50.671
Uh-uh. get back
in your office.

100
00:06:50.671 --> 00:06:52.237
- We need to stop that leak!
- No.

101
00:06:52.237 --> 00:06:54.065
You have got
to protect your baby!

102
00:06:55.937 --> 00:06:57.721
If you wanna help.
call for backup. okay?

103
00:07:12.562 --> 00:07:13.607
Maurice?

104
00:07:13.607 --> 00:07:15.565
Oh!

105
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.271
Oh. no.
What's wrong with them?

106
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:28.143
Iris said it was a gas leak.
It must be halon

107
00:07:28.143 --> 00:07:29.666
from the
fire suppression system.

108
00:07:29.666 --> 00:07:31.146
Are they alive?

109
00:07:31.146 --> 00:07:32.800
Their heartbeats
are so faint.

110
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.149
Well. if they were
breathing in halon.

111
00:07:34.149 --> 00:07:35.672
their brains were starved
of oxygen.

112
00:07:35.672 --> 00:07:37.718
I don't know what we can do
to help them.

113
00:07:37.718 --> 00:07:39.110
I do.

114
00:07:48.511 --> 00:07:49.947
What are you doing to them?

115
00:07:49.947 --> 00:07:52.123
Growing plant cells
inside their body

116
00:07:52.123 --> 00:07:53.864
to help them breathe.

117
00:07:53.864 --> 00:07:55.562
Since when can you do that?

118
00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:13.014
Don't worry.

119
00:08:13.014 --> 00:08:14.668
Your lungs are just getting
used to breathing again.

120
00:08:16.147 --> 00:08:17.497
My chest!

121
00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:19.150
It's on fire!

122
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.152
It's worse than
breathing in tear gas!

123
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.421
What the hell
did you do to us?

124
00:08:29.421 --> 00:08:32.424
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

125
00:08:32.424 --> 00:08:33.730
Just give it a few minutes.
and your bodies

126
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.471
will be back to normal.

127
00:08:35.471 --> 00:08:38.518
I don't know what you are.
but stay away from us!

128
00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:40.215
Ah!

129
00:08:43.653 --> 00:08:45.437
What the hell was all that?

130
00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:48.179
Hang on.

131
00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:51.269
Where's Allegra?

132
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:53.402
No.

133
00:08:53.402 --> 00:08:55.622
Allegra. wake up!

134
00:08:55.622 --> 00:08:56.797
Allegra!

135
00:08:59.016 --> 00:09:00.496
Wake up. Allegra!

136
00:09:05.588 --> 00:09:06.763
I just don't understand.

137
00:09:06.763 --> 00:09:08.591
She's not waking up.

138
00:09:08.591 --> 00:09:10.288
I mean. did the halon gas
do this to her?

139
00:09:10.288 --> 00:09:11.986
I don't think so.

140
00:09:11.986 --> 00:09:15.337
I'm so sorry. Chester.

141
00:09:15.337 --> 00:09:16.730
She just left my office.

142
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.819
She was trying
to help me. and--

143
00:09:18.819 --> 00:09:22.736
<i>I finished analyzing
Allegra Garcia's symptoms.</i>

144
00:09:22.736 --> 00:09:26.043
<i>She appears to be suffering
from acute radiation syndrome.</i>

145
00:09:26.043 --> 00:09:29.307
<i>There is evidence of a blast
of the cobalt-97 isotope.</i>

146
00:09:29.307 --> 00:09:32.354
She was attacked
with cobalt radiation?

147
00:09:32.354 --> 00:09:34.138
That means
whoever took Barry--

148
00:09:34.138 --> 00:09:36.576
Also attacked Allegra.

149
00:09:39.666 --> 00:09:42.320
Someone is coming
after this team.

150
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.322
The radiation
made Barry disappear.

151
00:09:44.322 --> 00:09:47.021
It didn't put him into a coma.
like it did with Allegra.

152
00:09:47.021 --> 00:09:48.413
We don't know that.

153
00:09:48.413 --> 00:09:49.806
He could be comatose
wherever he went.

154
00:09:49.806 --> 00:09:51.678
Hey. wherever Barry is.

155
00:09:51.678 --> 00:09:53.418
and whatever happened to him.

156
00:09:53.418 --> 00:09:55.420
we need to trust that he can
take care of himself.

157
00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.467
'cause right now. we've all got
targets on our backs.

158
00:09:58.467 --> 00:10:01.644
Any one of us could be next.

159
00:10:01.644 --> 00:10:05.343
Khione. what you did
at CCC Media.

160
00:10:05.343 --> 00:10:07.258
do you think maybe
you could cure

161
00:10:07.258 --> 00:10:09.086
Allegra's radiation poisoning?

162
00:10:09.086 --> 00:10:12.655
I can only expel
the unnatural from people.

163
00:10:12.655 --> 00:10:16.311
and the cobalt isotope
is part of the natural order.

164
00:10:16.311 --> 00:10:18.530
Let's lock this place
down then. shall we?

165
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.620
Khione and I can survey
the building together.

166
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.143
And. Iris. for the time being.

167
00:10:22.143 --> 00:10:24.275
maybe you should wait
in the time vault?

168
00:10:24.275 --> 00:10:26.451
I can't help look for Barry
from inside of there.

169
00:10:26.451 --> 00:10:28.018
What--
- Let me handle that.

170
00:10:28.018 --> 00:10:29.933
I just started resetting
the satellites

171
00:10:29.933 --> 00:10:31.979
to scan for the cobalt isotope.

172
00:10:31.979 --> 00:10:33.937
The algorithm
just needs another hour.

173
00:10:33.937 --> 00:10:35.286
Okay.

174
00:10:35.286 --> 00:10:37.767
Let's stay safe. yeah?

175
00:10:37.767 --> 00:10:39.639
We need to make sure
that everyone is alive

176
00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:42.119
when Barry gets back.

177
00:10:42.119 --> 00:10:44.382
<i>It's unbelievable.</i>

178
00:10:44.382 --> 00:10:47.081
You look exactly
like Detective Thawne.

179
00:10:49.387 --> 00:10:51.259
Do you have any ID
on you. Mr. Gilmore?

180
00:10:51.259 --> 00:10:53.783
Dr. Gilmore.

181
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.237
There a problem?

182
00:11:13.237 --> 00:11:14.935
Sorry.

183
00:11:14.935 --> 00:11:16.588
No.

184
00:11:24.248 --> 00:11:26.120
You wanna tell me again
how you found this file?

185
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.643
We've been through this!

186
00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:35.259
There was a lightning strike
in my office at Mercury Labs.

187
00:11:47.532 --> 00:11:52.929
When I woke up.
it was there. staring at me.

188
00:11:52.929 --> 00:11:57.151
And I suddenly had this feeling
that I needed

189
00:11:57.151 --> 00:12:00.458
to know more
about Detective Thawne

190
00:12:00.458 --> 00:12:06.377
and why he looks just like me.

191
00:12:06.377 --> 00:12:08.118
You think I'm crazy.

192
00:12:08.118 --> 00:12:09.946
You know what?
Forget this.

193
00:12:09.946 --> 00:12:11.774
Keep your classified file.

194
00:12:11.774 --> 00:12:13.123
I don't need it anyway.

195
00:12:13.123 --> 00:12:17.388
Wait.

196
00:12:17.388 --> 00:12:19.956
I worked with Detective Thawne.

197
00:12:21.828 --> 00:12:27.747
And even though he was a vet
and I was a rookie.

198
00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:32.577
he went out of his way
to make me feel welcome.

199
00:12:32.577 --> 00:12:37.191
I don't think any of us
ever really got over his death.

200
00:12:37.191 --> 00:12:39.759
What happened to him?

201
00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:43.110
His cause of death
was redacted in the report.

202
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:47.157
Never got an official story.

203
00:12:47.157 --> 00:12:49.464
Sadly. not
the only mysterious death

204
00:12:49.464 --> 00:12:52.510
to happen in Central City.

205
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:54.556
Find her.

206
00:12:59.996 --> 00:13:03.739
Did you hear something?

207
00:13:03.739 --> 00:13:06.220
Hear what?

208
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.831
<i>Find her!</i>

209
00:13:11.921 --> 00:13:13.967
I'm sorry.

210
00:13:13.967 --> 00:13:16.099
I need to leave.

211
00:13:16.099 --> 00:13:17.535
Wait.
Please!

212
00:13:17.535 --> 00:13:18.841
Let me help you!

213
00:13:26.022 --> 00:13:30.374
Lounge looks clear.

214
00:13:30.374 --> 00:13:32.028
You okay?

215
00:13:32.028 --> 00:13:34.988
Yeah.

216
00:13:34.988 --> 00:13:37.338
You upset that I've been
in touch with Cecile?

217
00:13:37.338 --> 00:13:38.730
No. not at all.

218
00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:40.036
I'm glad you had
someone to talk to.

219
00:13:40.036 --> 00:13:41.821
It's just.
these last few months.

220
00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:45.607
there were so many things
I wanted to talk to you about.

221
00:13:45.607 --> 00:13:48.044
I guess you just didn't
wanna talk to me.

222
00:13:48.044 --> 00:13:50.394
I...

223
00:13:50.394 --> 00:13:54.572
It's not--
Look. I--

224
00:13:54.572 --> 00:13:56.487
I spent the last seven months

225
00:13:56.487 --> 00:13:59.664
trying to get my head on
straight. you know.

226
00:13:59.664 --> 00:14:05.235
so that I could accept my--
my grief. which I think I have.

227
00:14:05.235 --> 00:14:11.851
But I also learned that...

228
00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:16.029
sometimes. people grow apart.

229
00:14:16.029 --> 00:14:19.554
Not when you have
a bond like we did.

230
00:14:19.554 --> 00:14:21.861
I know we had our problems.

231
00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:24.820
but I forgave you
before you left...

232
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.170
for everything.

233
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.869
So what changed?

234
00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:32.610
You did. Khione!

235
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:35.613
You are not the same person
you were when I left!

236
00:14:35.613 --> 00:14:37.659
What you did
to those people tonight.

237
00:14:37.659 --> 00:14:39.400
They were dying.

238
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.967
I needed to help them breathe.

239
00:14:40.967 --> 00:14:43.491
Oh. so you turned them
into mutant plant people?

240
00:14:43.491 --> 00:14:46.494
I used nature to bring
air to their lungs.

241
00:14:46.494 --> 00:14:48.191
Khione. there
was nothing natural

242
00:14:48.191 --> 00:14:49.584
about what I saw today.

243
00:14:49.584 --> 00:14:50.846
You warped their bodies.

244
00:14:50.846 --> 00:14:53.153
You made them into monsters!

245
00:14:53.153 --> 00:14:57.635
What--what right
do you have to do that?

246
00:14:57.635 --> 00:14:59.072
I didn't have a choice.

247
00:14:59.072 --> 00:15:00.203
I saved them!

248
00:15:00.203 --> 00:15:01.248
Saved them?

249
00:15:01.248 --> 00:15:03.076
You tortured them.

250
00:15:03.076 --> 00:15:04.512
They could barely speak.

251
00:15:04.512 --> 00:15:05.948
Their skin was green.

252
00:15:05.948 --> 00:15:07.515
You hurt them!

253
00:15:07.515 --> 00:15:09.560
I would never hurt
a living being!

254
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.084
Really?

255
00:15:11.084 --> 00:15:13.434
Did you notice
they didn't say thank you?

256
00:15:13.434 --> 00:15:16.219
They ran away!

257
00:15:16.219 --> 00:15:18.178
Before I left Central City.
I told you there was

258
00:15:18.178 --> 00:15:21.355
something amazing
inside of you.

259
00:15:21.355 --> 00:15:25.446
I really thought
you were gonna be a hero.

260
00:15:25.446 --> 00:15:27.143
but I was wrong.

261
00:15:29.363 --> 00:15:30.842
Khione. you--

262
00:15:33.758 --> 00:15:35.630
you're an abomination.

263
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:55.128
Iris. I know
that you're hurting right now.

264
00:15:55.128 --> 00:15:59.654
I can feel the despair
pouring off of you.

265
00:15:59.654 --> 00:16:01.134
These last few months.
getting everything

266
00:16:01.134 --> 00:16:04.789
ready for Nora.
painting the nursery.

267
00:16:04.789 --> 00:16:06.269
letting myself dream

268
00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:11.100
of the world that's ahead
of us--

269
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:14.756
it was too good to be true.

270
00:16:14.756 --> 00:16:17.280
Every time something
really great happens.

271
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:23.112
something worse comes along
and just cancels it out.

272
00:16:23.112 --> 00:16:24.461
So...

273
00:16:24.461 --> 00:16:27.551
Iris. Barry will come home.

274
00:16:27.551 --> 00:16:30.380
He always does.

275
00:16:59.322 --> 00:17:01.585
Mark?

276
00:17:01.585 --> 00:17:03.326
Khione's gone.

277
00:17:03.326 --> 00:17:04.806
We were doing a perimeter sweep
in the lounge.

278
00:17:04.806 --> 00:17:06.242
and she just bailed.

279
00:17:06.242 --> 00:17:07.765
What?
Why?

280
00:17:07.765 --> 00:17:09.637
When we were at CCC Media.

281
00:17:09.637 --> 00:17:13.945
Khione really scared the people
she was trying to save.

282
00:17:13.945 --> 00:17:15.860
She said she felt
like a monster.

283
00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.211
But Khione
wouldn't just leave us.

284
00:17:18.211 --> 00:17:20.604
not while we're in danger.

285
00:17:20.604 --> 00:17:23.172
I was so excited
to see her again.

286
00:17:23.172 --> 00:17:25.870
so excited to reconnect.

287
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:30.832
And then she just left.

288
00:17:30.832 --> 00:17:34.662
It's like losing Frost
all over again.

289
00:17:34.662 --> 00:17:37.360
I'm so sorry. man.

290
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:42.931
I--I know how hard
it was when she died.

291
00:17:42.931 --> 00:17:45.977
After Frost came back
from fighting Deathstorm.

292
00:17:45.977 --> 00:17:47.762
Caitlin had her in the med lab.

293
00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:52.201
I never should have left
that room. man.

294
00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:53.681
And maybe I couldn't
have saved her either.

295
00:17:53.681 --> 00:17:54.812
but at least
I could have been there

296
00:17:54.812 --> 00:17:56.292
at her side to hold her hand.

297
00:17:56.292 --> 00:17:58.294
to tell her that I loved her
before she--

298
00:18:03.038 --> 00:18:08.391
Uh.... maybe when I'm done
resetting the satellite. I'll--

299
00:18:08.391 --> 00:18:10.089
I'll go check on Allegra.

300
00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:11.612
Yeah.

301
00:18:15.355 --> 00:18:17.531
You know. I'm not
doing anything right now.

302
00:18:17.531 --> 00:18:20.011
You just need to recalibrate
the scanners

303
00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:21.926
to look for cobalt radiation. right?

304
00:18:21.926 --> 00:18:24.494
Yeah.

305
00:18:24.494 --> 00:18:26.366
I can finish it
for you. if you want.

306
00:18:28.498 --> 00:18:29.673
Really?

307
00:18:29.673 --> 00:18:31.284
Of course.

308
00:18:32.894 --> 00:18:34.461
Thanks. man.

309
00:18:34.461 --> 00:18:35.766
Be with her.

310
00:19:13.369 --> 00:19:14.501

311
00:19:14.501 --> 00:19:15.937

00:20:00.416 --> 00:20:02.157
Thanks. Mark.
I'll come grab it.

330
00:20:02.157 --> 00:20:03.376
Be right back.

331
00:20:12.907 --> 00:20:14.517
What the hell?

332
00:20:18.869 --> 00:20:21.132
Cecile!

333
00:20:24.005 --> 00:20:28.183
Mark. what the hell's going on?

334
00:20:28.183 --> 00:20:31.534
Oh. Mark
isn't here right now.

335
00:20:31.534 --> 00:20:33.667
But he served
his purpose. didn't he?

336
00:20:33.667 --> 00:20:36.496
To get all of your teammates
out of the way

337
00:20:36.496 --> 00:20:38.324
so that I could get to you.

338
00:20:38.324 --> 00:20:40.543
the Avatar's lightning rod.

339
00:20:40.543 --> 00:20:42.806
You're the Negative
Speed Force. aren't you?

340
00:20:42.806 --> 00:20:48.508
Now I'm gonna do what I've
wanted to do for a long time.

341
00:20:48.508 --> 00:20:51.380
I'm going to gut you
like a fish.

342
00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.817
and your little baby. too.

343
00:20:53.817 --> 00:20:57.821
Time to eliminate
the competition. permanently.

344
00:21:00.563 --> 00:21:02.391
Gah!

345
00:21:02.391 --> 00:21:04.959
Leave her alone!

346
00:21:04.959 --> 00:21:06.961
Nora. are you okay?

347
00:21:06.961 --> 00:21:08.658
Dos she seem okay to you?

348
00:21:08.658 --> 00:21:09.964
Oh!

349
00:21:09.964 --> 00:21:11.661
You can't stay in this plane

350
00:21:11.661 --> 00:21:13.097
of existence forever--

351
00:21:13.097 --> 00:21:15.056
not in the state you're in.

352
00:21:15.056 --> 00:21:17.841
And the moment
you leave to go and heal.

353
00:21:17.841 --> 00:21:21.018
I am coming back for her.

354
00:21:21.018 --> 00:21:24.761
and the entire Allen family!

355
00:21:32.595 --> 00:21:34.205
This is crazy!

356
00:21:34.205 --> 00:21:35.642
We trusted Mark.

357
00:21:35.642 --> 00:21:37.252
He was supposed to protect us.

358
00:21:37.252 --> 00:21:38.949
Turns out he was
hunting us the whole time.

359
00:21:38.949 --> 00:21:40.734
He distracted me
from the satellites.

360
00:21:40.734 --> 00:21:44.390
and he must have upset Khione.
too. to make her leave.

361
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:45.956
Does this mean
he's the new avatar?

362
00:21:45.956 --> 00:21:47.131
No.

363
00:21:47.131 --> 00:21:48.872
Mark's body is just a vessel.

364
00:21:48.872 --> 00:21:50.570
Whatever they're trying
to use him for.

365
00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.615
it's unlike anything
I've ever seen.

366
00:21:54.356 --> 00:21:56.315
- Whoa.
- Oh.

367
00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:59.230
Yeah. the negative forces--

368
00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:03.757
they're attacking me right now
on the cosmic plane.

369
00:22:03.757 --> 00:22:05.889
trying to distract me
from whatever their plan is.

370
00:22:05.889 --> 00:22:07.238
Oh. my God.

371
00:22:07.238 --> 00:22:08.936
Is that why Barry
can't get home.

372
00:22:08.936 --> 00:22:10.851
because he's being held
captive somewhere?

373
00:22:10.851 --> 00:22:12.809
I think so.

374
00:22:12.809 --> 00:22:16.335
Because his connection to me--
it's been disrupted

375
00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:18.859
ever since he's vanished.

376
00:22:18.859 --> 00:22:23.037
I can't find him anywhere
in time or space.

377
00:22:23.037 --> 00:22:24.343
Chester. you need to get

378
00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:25.822
the cobalt scanners
online fast.

379
00:22:25.822 --> 00:22:29.652
I'm really trying.
but Mark sabotaged

380
00:22:29.652 --> 00:22:30.784
all the work
that I had already done.

381
00:22:30.784 --> 00:22:32.263
Well. try harder. please.

382
00:22:32.263 --> 00:22:34.570
He wants to kill
my baby. my family.

383
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.659
and we don't have
a way to stop him!

384
00:22:36.659 --> 00:22:39.619
There's still someone
who can help us:

385
00:22:39.619 --> 00:22:40.837
Khione.

386
00:22:49.629 --> 00:22:51.457
Come on!

387
00:22:51.457 --> 00:22:54.373
There's gotta be something
about you here. Eddie.

388
00:23:05.471 --> 00:23:07.821
I need security
to the CEO's office right now!

389
00:23:07.821 --> 00:23:10.693
No. I just need
to talk to Iris West.

390
00:23:10.693 --> 00:23:12.260
So you broke into her office?

391
00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.957
You need to leave!

392
00:23:13.957 --> 00:23:17.265
She used to know someone.
Eddie Thawne.

393
00:23:17.265 --> 00:23:19.310
I need to find out
what happened to him.

394
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:22.401
It's a matter
of life and death.

395
00:23:27.101 --> 00:23:28.668
<i>- Eddie!
- Eddie!</i>

396
00:23:29.712 --> 00:23:31.888
Ah!

397
00:23:31.888 --> 00:23:34.891
What did you do?

398
00:23:34.891 --> 00:23:36.893
<i>That's how you and I met.</i>

399
00:23:36.893 --> 00:23:39.156
What did you do. Eddie?

400
00:23:39.156 --> 00:23:41.202
In here!

401
00:23:43.683 --> 00:23:45.946
I need to see how he died.

402
00:23:51.778 --> 00:23:54.258
Gideon. can you start
a recording

403
00:23:54.258 --> 00:23:55.912
for Barry's eyes only?

404
00:23:55.912 --> 00:23:58.219
<i>Yes. Iris West-Allen.</i>

405
00:23:58.219 --> 00:24:00.830
Can you show me a picture
from our wedding day?

406
00:24:03.354 --> 00:24:07.358
Barry. I have no idea
how this is gonna end.

407
00:24:07.358 --> 00:24:10.013
We're under attack
from the Negative Speed Force.

408
00:24:13.582 --> 00:24:15.105
Deep down inside.
I have a feeling

409
00:24:15.105 --> 00:24:17.847
that right now.
you're under attack. too.

410
00:24:17.847 --> 00:24:22.461
Tonight. a new world begins!

411
00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:25.246
No matter what. I know
that the love that we share

412
00:24:25.246 --> 00:24:27.378
<i>and the connection
that we have</i>

413
00:24:27.378 --> 00:24:28.989
<i>can never be broken.</i>

414
00:24:28.989 --> 00:24:31.165
because we will never stop
fighting for it.

415
00:24:37.737 --> 00:24:43.220
I felt so powerless today.

416
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.657
but I guess this is me saying

417
00:24:44.657 --> 00:24:48.617
that I'm standing
on my own two feet.

418
00:24:48.617 --> 00:24:51.751
And I'm gonna be strong.

419
00:24:51.751 --> 00:24:57.757
And I know we'll find our way
back to each other.

420
00:24:57.757 --> 00:24:59.062
We always do.

421
00:25:08.289 --> 00:25:10.465
What is happening?

422
00:25:10.465 --> 00:25:13.207
Did you just summon me?

423
00:25:16.036 --> 00:25:17.864
Who are you?

424
00:25:17.864 --> 00:25:20.736
I'm the Speed Force.

425
00:25:22.695 --> 00:25:24.697
Are you okay?

426
00:25:24.697 --> 00:25:26.655
No.

427
00:25:26.655 --> 00:25:30.267
I used up some of my last bits
of strength to bring you here.

428
00:25:30.267 --> 00:25:31.747
Uh!

429
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:40.147
I can't help your friends.
not anymore.

430
00:25:40.147 --> 00:25:41.844
It's up to you.

431
00:25:41.844 --> 00:25:44.543
I can't help anyone.

432
00:25:44.543 --> 00:25:49.112
Even when I try. I hurt people.

433
00:25:49.112 --> 00:25:52.507
That's what a friend of mine
told me. and he's right.

434
00:25:52.507 --> 00:25:55.554
I'm inhuman.

435
00:25:55.554 --> 00:25:59.601
I know.
That's the point.

436
00:25:59.601 --> 00:26:03.605
Human emotions.
human feelings--

437
00:26:03.605 --> 00:26:06.129
they give us strength.

438
00:26:06.129 --> 00:26:08.218
but they can also
weigh us down.

439
00:26:08.218 --> 00:26:11.091
Look what happened
to you today.

440
00:26:11.091 --> 00:26:12.919
You were so blinded by emotion

441
00:26:12.919 --> 00:26:15.878
that you couldn't see the truth
right in front of you.

442
00:26:17.663 --> 00:26:20.970
The Mark wasn't
really Mark at all.

443
00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:23.146
Well then.
why don't you defeat him?

444
00:26:23.146 --> 00:26:25.627
Because my power is fading.

445
00:26:25.627 --> 00:26:30.763
I am running out of time.
Khione. and so are you.

446
00:26:30.763 --> 00:26:33.592
But you are still denying
who you really are.

447
00:26:33.592 --> 00:26:37.857
No. I'm not denying anything.

448
00:26:37.857 --> 00:26:42.470
I've tried to figure out
who I am. what my powers are.

449
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:43.863
where they came from.

450
00:26:43.863 --> 00:26:47.693
Seven months ago.
you made it snow.

451
00:26:47.693 --> 00:26:53.002
Today. you transformed people's
physiology with a thought.

452
00:26:53.002 --> 00:26:54.743
What else have you done?

453
00:26:56.832 --> 00:27:00.357
I can become any element.

454
00:27:00.357 --> 00:27:04.797
I have rescued people. animals.

455
00:27:04.797 --> 00:27:06.799
entire ecosystems

456
00:27:06.799 --> 00:27:09.976
from invading
unnatural assailants.

457
00:27:12.108 --> 00:27:17.374
I can feel everything
all over the planet.

458
00:27:17.374 --> 00:27:20.813
a volcano exploding in Bali.

459
00:27:20.813 --> 00:27:25.295
a blade of grass in Peru--

460
00:27:25.295 --> 00:27:26.862
every living thing.

461
00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.476
It sounds to me

462
00:27:32.476 --> 00:27:34.217
like you already know
what you are.

463
00:27:44.837 --> 00:27:48.057
Please. Khione.
help your friends.

464
00:27:49.885 --> 00:27:51.626
Embrace your power.

465
00:27:51.626 --> 00:27:53.584
What if I can't?

466
00:27:53.584 --> 00:27:57.937
Then your team. this city.

467
00:27:57.937 --> 00:28:01.157
and everyone on the planet
will suffer.

468
00:28:07.598 --> 00:28:09.035
What's happening?

469
00:28:09.035 --> 00:28:10.471
I got
the cobalt scanners working.

470
00:28:10.471 --> 00:28:12.255
They picked up
on Mark's signature.

471
00:28:12.255 --> 00:28:14.780
Wait. isn't that--

472
00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.260
Caitlin's old apartment?
Yeah.

473
00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:18.697
Oh. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!

474
00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:19.828
The barometric pressure there

475
00:28:19.828 --> 00:28:21.569
just shifted 1.000 millibars?

476
00:28:21.569 --> 00:28:23.223
That's like a hurricane's
about to hit the place.

477
00:28:23.223 --> 00:28:27.923
No. that's no hurricane.

478
00:28:40.501 --> 00:28:44.592
I've been waiting
for you. Khione.

479
00:28:44.592 --> 00:28:47.595
You're the only one left

480
00:28:47.595 --> 00:28:49.510
that I have to take
off the board

481
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:52.992
before I can get everything
I want--

482
00:28:52.992 --> 00:28:55.298
the only one
who can protect her.

483
00:28:57.431 --> 00:29:01.174
So.. let's do this.

484
00:29:03.219 --> 00:29:04.743
Bring it on.

485
00:29:12.881 --> 00:29:15.275
Something's
different about you.

486
00:29:15.275 --> 00:29:17.320
The Speed Force
helped me embrace

487
00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:21.977
all the power that's inside me.
and it is a lot of power.

488
00:29:21.977 --> 00:29:24.110
But I don't wanna hurt you.

489
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:27.983
so I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

490
00:29:27.983 --> 00:29:30.638
Leave my friend's body

491
00:29:30.638 --> 00:29:35.904
and crawl back to whatever hole
in the universe you came from.

492
00:29:40.822 --> 00:29:42.345
There's not a chance.

493
00:29:42.345 --> 00:29:45.740
See. if you wanna take me out.

494
00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:48.221
you've got to murder
your best friend.

495
00:29:48.221 --> 00:29:50.005
What are you talking about?

496
00:29:50.005 --> 00:29:52.965
Oh. did your life coach
not get into the nitty-gritty

497
00:29:52.965 --> 00:29:55.184
with you when she gave you
your little pep talk?

498
00:29:55.184 --> 00:29:58.840
So here's the deal.

499
00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:05.368
Mark--he's still in here.
and I am not leaving this body.

500
00:30:05.368 --> 00:30:09.459
So if you wanna stop me.
really stop me.

501
00:30:09.459 --> 00:30:12.245
the only way is to kill Mark.

502
00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:23.996
Gideon?

503
00:30:23.996 --> 00:30:26.346
Can you scan me
for anything unusual?

504
00:30:26.346 --> 00:30:29.349
<i>Of course. Scanning.</i>

505
00:30:29.349 --> 00:30:30.959
<i>You're having
mild contractions.</i>

506
00:30:30.959 --> 00:30:32.395
I'm in labor?

507
00:30:36.443 --> 00:30:43.232
So long as I have
this crystal...

508
00:30:43.232 --> 00:30:46.322
I am in charge.

509
00:30:46.322 --> 00:30:48.411
I know.

510
00:30:48.411 --> 00:30:50.413
That's why I'm removing it.

511
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:54.129
Sorry. Mark.

512
00:31:54.129 --> 00:31:56.305
This is gonna hurt.

513
00:32:23.593 --> 00:32:24.899
What the hell?

514
00:32:24.899 --> 00:32:29.599
What'd you do to me?

515
00:32:29.599 --> 00:32:31.297
I saved you.

516
00:32:31.297 --> 00:32:32.646
Huh.

517
00:32:42.569 --> 00:32:44.049
Where'd that thing go?

518
00:32:44.049 --> 00:32:49.271
I don't know.
but it can't be good.

519
00:32:49.271 --> 00:32:51.273
Oh. frak yeah!

520
00:32:51.273 --> 00:32:52.971
I'm not picking up
cobalt radiation anymore.

521
00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:54.320
Yes! Yes!

522
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.886
That means Khione won...

523
00:32:55.886 --> 00:32:57.714
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?

524
00:32:57.714 --> 00:32:59.629
Ah!

525
00:32:59.629 --> 00:33:01.240
What--what's wrong?
What happened?

526
00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.632
Oh. God. I just--

527
00:33:02.632 --> 00:33:04.852
I'm getting
a massive wave of panic--

528
00:33:04.852 --> 00:33:09.378
but also joy?

529
00:33:11.076 --> 00:33:14.993
Guys. the baby's coming.

530
00:33:17.125 --> 00:33:20.041
Iris. honey.
that's great news!

531
00:33:20.041 --> 00:33:21.608
Hey. you all right?

532
00:33:21.608 --> 00:33:23.566
I'm getting a lot
of wild emotions off of you.

533
00:33:23.566 --> 00:33:25.525
No. I am really happy.
I am.

534
00:33:25.525 --> 00:33:28.310
I just--I thought Barry
would be back in time.

535
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:31.052
Guys. what's--what's that?

536
00:33:38.146 --> 00:33:40.322
Barry?

537
00:33:40.322 --> 00:33:41.976
Iris.

538
00:33:41.976 --> 00:33:43.499
Is it really you?

539
00:33:43.499 --> 00:33:44.892
Yeah.

540
00:33:44.892 --> 00:33:46.285
I'm back.

541
00:33:46.285 --> 00:33:47.373
Oh!

542
00:33:47.373 --> 00:33:49.114
I'm back.

543
00:33:49.114 --> 00:33:51.159
Oh. man. I knew
you'd find your way home.

544
00:33:51.159 --> 00:33:52.726
Yeah. I did. too.
but. Barry.

545
00:33:52.726 --> 00:33:56.338
we gotta get Iris
to the hospital. like. now.

546
00:33:56.338 --> 00:33:58.732
- Right now?
- Yeah.

547
00:33:58.732 --> 00:34:01.039
We're having a baby.

548
00:34:07.001 --> 00:34:08.437
There you go.

549
00:34:08.437 --> 00:34:10.309
- Oof.
- You got this.

550
00:34:12.702 --> 00:34:14.313
- Okay.
- Yeah?

551
00:34:14.313 --> 00:34:15.575
I think they're gone.

552
00:34:15.575 --> 00:34:18.360
- Okay.
- Oof. Ooh.

553
00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:21.624
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

554
00:34:21.624 --> 00:34:23.148
Woo.

555
00:34:23.148 --> 00:34:25.063
I didn't think
you'd enjoy contractions.

556
00:34:25.063 --> 00:34:26.716
Oh. no. they're horrible.

557
00:34:26.716 --> 00:34:29.197
I just--

558
00:34:29.197 --> 00:34:32.113
I don't care.
just as long as you're here.

559
00:34:35.769 --> 00:34:38.163
I'm just sorry that I
wasn't there for you today.

560
00:34:38.163 --> 00:34:40.469
everything that
you went through.

561
00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:42.645
I always knew that someday.
my life would lead me

562
00:34:42.645 --> 00:34:45.561
back to that night.

563
00:34:45.561 --> 00:34:47.563
<i>the night my mom died.</i>

564
00:34:50.436 --> 00:34:54.396
I just thought that when
it came. I'd be afraid.

565
00:34:54.396 --> 00:34:56.311
I wasn't.

566
00:34:56.311 --> 00:35:00.315
I got the chance
to see my parents again.

567
00:35:00.315 --> 00:35:03.753
and I felt peace.

568
00:35:06.278 --> 00:35:07.540
I'm home now.

569
00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.846
I'm not going anywhere.

570
00:35:09.846 --> 00:35:11.587
I love you. Iris.

571
00:35:11.587 --> 00:35:13.633
I love you.

572
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:24.209
She's doing great.

573
00:35:24.209 --> 00:35:25.471
Oh. thank you.

574
00:35:25.471 --> 00:35:27.212
Oh. that's terrific.

575
00:35:27.212 --> 00:35:28.952
Allegra's almost done
with her iodine treatment.

576
00:35:28.952 --> 00:35:30.780
She'll be here any minute.

577
00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.391
Oh. tell her
to take her time.

578
00:35:32.391 --> 00:35:34.044
The doctor says
we still have a few more hours

579
00:35:34.044 --> 00:35:35.568
before the baby arrives.

580
00:35:35.568 --> 00:35:37.483
Now we just need to hope
that crystal

581
00:35:37.483 --> 00:35:39.485
doesn't show up again
in the meantime.

582
00:35:39.485 --> 00:35:43.053
Nora said Mark was possessed
by the Negative Speed Force.

583
00:35:43.053 --> 00:35:45.447
Whatever that crystal is.
it's unlike any weapon

584
00:35:45.447 --> 00:35:46.883
we've ever seen before.

585
00:35:46.883 --> 00:35:48.494
It's traveling through time.

586
00:35:48.494 --> 00:35:49.930
trying to use our friends
to kill us

587
00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:52.193
all through the timeline.
all at once.

588
00:35:52.193 --> 00:35:54.282
I'm gonna go and start
looking for this rock

589
00:35:54.282 --> 00:35:56.197
before it finds another victim.

590
00:35:58.678 --> 00:36:02.682
Mark. are you sure
you're up for that?

591
00:36:02.682 --> 00:36:04.466
You were just reborn.

592
00:36:04.466 --> 00:36:08.644
Yeah. I feel fine.
you know. physically.

593
00:36:08.644 --> 00:36:10.255
I'm just glad you're back.

594
00:36:10.255 --> 00:36:11.647
I missed my friend.

595
00:36:13.736 --> 00:36:17.479
You know. I was away
these last seven months.

596
00:36:17.479 --> 00:36:19.916
I thought
about you all the time.

597
00:36:19.916 --> 00:36:21.309
I was wondering
how you were doing.

598
00:36:21.309 --> 00:36:22.832
Look at you.

599
00:36:22.832 --> 00:36:24.965
You've already become
even more powerful

600
00:36:24.965 --> 00:36:27.402
than I ever
could have dreamed.

601
00:36:27.402 --> 00:36:30.405
You saved me
from the Negative Speed Force.

602
00:36:30.405 --> 00:36:31.667
How did you do that?

603
00:36:31.667 --> 00:36:33.495
I returned you to Earth.

604
00:36:33.495 --> 00:36:35.410
the mother of us all.

605
00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:37.586
And once you were safe
in her embrace.

606
00:36:37.586 --> 00:36:39.588
I raised you up.

607
00:36:39.588 --> 00:36:44.854
Given that kind of power.
what even are you?

608
00:36:47.379 --> 00:36:50.991
I'm a goddess.

609
00:36:50.991 --> 00:36:53.776
So what. are you like
the Speed Force now?

610
00:36:53.776 --> 00:36:55.561
Not exactly.

611
00:36:55.561 --> 00:36:59.565
I'm not just connected
to one force. or one element.

612
00:36:59.565 --> 00:37:02.045
but all of them.

613
00:37:02.045 --> 00:37:06.876
And if I'm gonna explore
what that really entails...

614
00:37:11.577 --> 00:37:14.667
I don't think it's my destiny

615
00:37:14.667 --> 00:37:17.583
to protect just this team.
or this city.

616
00:37:20.542 --> 00:37:22.892
Everything's got to change.

617
00:37:22.892 --> 00:37:24.720
What are you saying. exactly?

618
00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:28.942
I don't think
I can stay here--

619
00:37:28.942 --> 00:37:31.945
with you. with this team.

620
00:37:34.077 --> 00:37:35.731
I think I need to leave.

621
00:37:38.081 --> 00:37:40.954
Uh. what?

622
00:37:40.954 --> 00:37:42.564
Not yet.

623
00:37:42.564 --> 00:37:45.741
First. I'll help you stop
the negative Speed Force.

624
00:37:45.741 --> 00:37:48.875
Look. Khione.
whatever you need. we--ah!

625
00:37:48.875 --> 00:37:50.006
Oh. no!

626
00:37:50.006 --> 00:37:52.008
Barry!

627
00:37:52.008 --> 00:37:53.488
I can't feel him anymore.

628
00:37:56.099 --> 00:37:58.624
He's gone. again.

629
00:38:33.006 --> 00:38:34.224
Malcolm!

630
00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:39.186
Stop what you're doing. okay?
This is a crime.

631
00:38:39.186 --> 00:38:41.623
I need to see his corpse.

632
00:38:43.799 --> 00:38:45.671
It's the only way
I'll know the truth.

633
00:38:45.671 --> 00:38:47.063
About what?

634
00:38:47.063 --> 00:38:48.456
This is insane!

635
00:38:48.456 --> 00:38:51.154
I look like him!

636
00:38:51.154 --> 00:38:54.027
I have visions of his memories!

637
00:38:54.027 --> 00:38:58.510
And there's this voice
in my head.

638
00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:00.425
pushing and pushing!

639
00:39:00.425 --> 00:39:02.775
You can't be him.

640
00:39:02.775 --> 00:39:07.388
It's all just coincidence.

641
00:39:15.004 --> 00:39:16.832
There's no such thing
as a coincidence.

642
00:39:16.832 --> 00:39:22.142
No such thing
as a coincidence.

643
00:39:32.848 --> 00:39:35.329
Ah!

644
00:39:37.157 --> 00:39:39.507
I couldn't wait.

645
00:39:39.507 --> 00:39:40.552
I love you.

646
00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:46.862
Detective?

647
00:39:46.862 --> 00:39:48.124
Eddie. we need your help.

648
00:39:48.124 --> 00:39:51.432
Iris West.

649
00:39:51.432 --> 00:39:54.174
Eddie?
Eddie!

650
00:39:58.396 --> 00:40:07.622
What did you do?

651
00:40:07.622 --> 00:40:09.276
Eddie. no!
It's just you and me. okay?

652
00:40:09.276 --> 00:40:10.930
Say it.

653
00:40:16.022 --> 00:40:18.807
No.

654
00:40:18.807 --> 00:40:20.330
No!
Eddie!

655
00:40:22.898 --> 00:40:24.639
I remember everything.

656
00:40:28.164 --> 00:40:34.693
I shot myself in the chest.

657
00:40:36.129 --> 00:40:38.653
That wasn't you.

658
00:40:38.653 --> 00:40:41.351
Now put your hands
behind your back.

659
00:40:43.919 --> 00:40:50.317
I am Eddie Thawne.

660
00:40:50.317 --> 00:40:54.582
and I'll prove it to you.

661
00:41:12.644 --> 00:41:14.994
Now do you believe me?

662
00:41:44.327 --> 00:41:45.851
