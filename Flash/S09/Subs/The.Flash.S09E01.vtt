00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:02.785
<i>Last season on
"The Flash"...</i>

2
00:00:02.785 --> 00:00:03.873
<i>There's no sign of
your time sickness.</i>

3
00:00:03.873 --> 00:00:05.179
<i>You're completely cured.</i>
- Barry!

4
00:00:05.179 --> 00:00:07.703
- Iris?
<i>- I reignited our spark.</i>

5
00:00:07.703 --> 00:00:09.096
You're my lightning rod too.

6
00:00:09.096 --> 00:00:11.098
<i>I don't know how.</i>

7
00:00:11.098 --> 00:00:13.448
<i>You're the most powerful meta
this planet has ever seen.</i>

8
00:00:13.448 --> 00:00:16.407
You are date-worthy
in all the major categories.

9
00:00:16.407 --> 00:00:19.454
- I am?
- Yeah. definitely.

10
00:00:19.454 --> 00:00:21.717
Frost was supposed to live
a full life.

11
00:00:21.717 --> 00:00:23.458
I'm gonna bring Frost back.

12
00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:25.851
The circuitry should
stimulate and then reactivate

13
00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:28.593
<i>Frost's residual subconscious
left inside your mind.</i>

14
00:00:28.593 --> 00:00:30.856
Who the hell are you?

15
00:00:44.783 --> 00:00:46.568
Guys. look out!

16
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.066
Welcome back.

17
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.763
Let's do this one last time.

18
00:01:07.763 --> 00:01:09.547
Help! Help!

19
00:01:09.547 --> 00:01:11.245
Initiate omega maneuvers now.

20
00:01:14.422 --> 00:01:16.293
Who says work can't be fun?

21
00:01:23.648 --> 00:01:25.215
Not today. lava-face.

22
00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:34.006
Hey. Joey.
leave my "Friends" alone.

23
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.621
Easy peasy.

24
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:41.492
Joe. now.

25
00:01:44.234 --> 00:01:46.062
You should've kept
your behind

26
00:01:46.062 --> 00:01:47.281
at Iron Heights. Monteleone.

27
00:01:57.595 --> 00:01:59.336
Nice work. Team Flash.

28
00:01:59.336 --> 00:02:01.077
You can't win. Flash.

29
00:02:01.077 --> 00:02:03.210
This is the end of everything.

30
00:02:05.168 --> 00:02:06.865
Wait.

31
00:02:09.303 --> 00:02:11.435
Frost?

32
00:02:11.435 --> 00:02:12.828
But you're dead.

33
00:02:12.828 --> 00:02:14.264
Because
you couldn't protect me.

34
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.618
- I tried to keep you safe.
- But you couldn't.

35
00:02:20.618 --> 00:02:22.664
Just like
you can't save me and Chuck.

36
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.539
I'm sorry. son.
You did the best you could.

37
00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:29.671
It just wasn't good enough.

38
00:02:34.893 --> 00:02:36.721
Iris. no. Not you.

39
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:38.462
No. please.
I'll always protect you.

40
00:02:38.462 --> 00:02:40.334
I swear.

41
00:02:40.334 --> 00:02:42.074
You can't.

42
00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.730
No. no. no. no.
No. no. no. no. no.

43
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.212
Iris? Oh. Iris. No!

44
00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:38.261
Good morning.

45
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:39.349
Hi.

46
00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:45.529
It's Wednesday already.
isn't it?

47
00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:47.879
Yeah. sorry to crash
the party.

48
00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:54.190
I'm just not ready
to go back to work.

49
00:03:55.713 --> 00:03:59.021
I was lost in time for weeks
and now I just want to

50
00:03:59.021 --> 00:04:03.025
stay in bed
where it's cozy and safe.

51
00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:04.505
I know.

52
00:04:04.505 --> 00:04:06.289
But Thawne's gone.

53
00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:09.249
So is your time sickness.

54
00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.904
It's been a great seven days.

55
00:04:12.904 --> 00:04:14.558
Yeah. it has.

56
00:04:16.473 --> 00:04:18.910
Plus. I probably have

57
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.304
a lot of CCPD paperwork

58
00:04:21.304 --> 00:04:23.132
piled up by now.

59
00:04:26.353 --> 00:04:30.487
And you have a big day
at CCC Media.

60
00:04:30.487 --> 00:04:31.749
Big day.

61
00:04:34.186 --> 00:04:36.754
Ugh.

62
00:04:36.754 --> 00:04:39.844
Okay. remember.

63
00:04:39.844 --> 00:04:41.629
just say yes.

64
00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:42.804
Yes to what?

65
00:04:42.804 --> 00:04:44.327
We'll talk about it tonight.

66
00:04:44.327 --> 00:04:46.068
Have a great day.

67
00:04:53.554 --> 00:04:55.773
Namaste.

68
00:04:58.776 --> 00:05:01.344
Your try.

69
00:05:01.344 --> 00:05:04.652
Chester. are--Chester?

70
00:05:04.652 --> 00:05:07.611
- Yeah?
- Hi.

71
00:05:07.611 --> 00:05:09.004
Oh. right. right.

72
00:05:09.004 --> 00:05:11.485
Monitoring
Cecile's neural output.

73
00:05:11.485 --> 00:05:13.356
Come on. babe.
Give it a try.

74
00:05:13.356 --> 00:05:15.358
Let's work on
your telekinetic control

75
00:05:15.358 --> 00:05:17.012
and accuracy.
- Okay.

76
00:05:17.012 --> 00:05:18.013
Just focus. You got this.

77
00:05:18.013 --> 00:05:19.014
I got this.

78
00:05:19.014 --> 00:05:21.146
I am...

79
00:05:21.146 --> 00:05:23.540
telekinetic.

80
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.150
Boom.

81
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.413
Whoa!

82
00:05:26.413 --> 00:05:29.372
Sorry!
- Damn.

83
00:05:29.372 --> 00:05:31.418
Damn. Hey. no worries. Cecile.

84
00:05:31.418 --> 00:05:32.810
Once you master
these new powers...

85
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:35.944
You're gonna be
the new muscle of Team Flash.

86
00:05:35.944 --> 00:05:38.120
- Yeah? Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

87
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.557
Did you hear that? Muscle.

88
00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.387
Um...

89
00:05:44.387 --> 00:05:45.736
okay.

90
00:05:45.736 --> 00:05:46.824
What's wrong now?

91
00:05:48.826 --> 00:05:50.480
It's nothing.

92
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.699
Stop stalling.

93
00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:55.616
I'm not stalling.

94
00:05:55.616 --> 00:05:56.704
I got this.

95
00:05:57.922 --> 00:05:59.141
I got this.

96
00:05:59.141 --> 00:06:01.317
Be the ball.

97
00:06:02.666 --> 00:06:04.015
Whoa! Look out!

98
00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:07.584
Oh. boy.

99
00:06:09.412 --> 00:06:11.327
<i>Okay. get me up to speed.</i>

100
00:06:11.327 --> 00:06:13.721
Well. Taylor is handling
our new ad-free portal.

101
00:06:13.721 --> 00:06:15.897
Oh. you two are okay
these days?

102
00:06:15.897 --> 00:06:17.507
Oh. yeah.
You missed the whole

103
00:06:17.507 --> 00:06:19.596
hostage situation
with Sunshine and Dr. Light.

104
00:06:19.596 --> 00:06:22.599
Taylor. Vanya. and Aariz know
I am a meta now

105
00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:24.906
and they are keeping my secret. so...

106
00:06:24.906 --> 00:06:27.387
Ooh!
- Oh. I am so sorry.

107
00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.519
Iris. we missed you.

108
00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:31.042
But also.
we've gotta do something

109
00:06:31.042 --> 00:06:32.522
about our filing system.

110
00:06:32.522 --> 00:06:33.871
I'm trying to fact check
my "High Life" piece

111
00:06:33.871 --> 00:06:35.090
and I can't find anything.

112
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.135
- I'll look into it.
- Thanks.

113
00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:39.964
And boss. I have a feeling

114
00:06:39.964 --> 00:06:43.141
more than just our filing
system is about to change.

115
00:06:43.141 --> 00:06:45.448
What is that supposed
to mean?

116
00:06:45.448 --> 00:06:47.102
I have a surprise for you.

117
00:06:47.102 --> 00:06:48.843
I wanted to tell you this
in person.

118
00:06:48.843 --> 00:06:51.193
so while you and Barry had
your weeklong staycation.

119
00:06:51.193 --> 00:06:54.022
I had a surprise meeting
with one Ms. Cat Grant.

120
00:06:54.022 --> 00:06:57.329
- As in CatCo. Cat Grant?
- Yes.

121
00:06:57.329 --> 00:07:00.202
CatCo Worldwide Media wants
to buy CCC Media

122
00:07:00.202 --> 00:07:01.899
and expand
your global footprint

123
00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:03.945
under the umbrella
of a major news conglomerate.

124
00:07:03.945 --> 00:07:05.773
She said it's a blank check.

125
00:07:05.773 --> 00:07:07.905
All you have to do
is just say yes.

126
00:07:09.298 --> 00:07:11.039
Iris.
this is your future empire.

127
00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:13.433
the one that Nora and Bart
are always talking about.

128
00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.086
This is how it starts.

129
00:07:15.086 --> 00:07:17.437
Maybe this is where
you win your first Pulitzer.

130
00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:20.222
Wow. Um...

131
00:07:20.222 --> 00:07:21.789
okay. that's a lot.

132
00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:23.268
So what do you think?

133
00:07:25.836 --> 00:07:28.622
I think...

134
00:07:28.622 --> 00:07:31.189
I left my phone at home.

135
00:07:32.582 --> 00:07:34.366
Uh. I will get back to you.

136
00:07:39.502 --> 00:07:40.634
Okay.

137
00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:45.595
Close the door. Allen.
We need to talk.

138
00:07:48.337 --> 00:07:50.034
Captain.
I'd like to put myself up

139
00:07:50.034 --> 00:07:52.123
for the position of director
of Central City Police.

140
00:07:52.123 --> 00:07:53.560
CSI division.

141
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.518
Wow.
You must be a mind reader.

142
00:07:55.518 --> 00:07:58.260
That's what
I was gonna talk to you about.

143
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.392
Siakam's retiring.

144
00:08:00.392 --> 00:08:02.351
Only I wasn't sure
if you'd be interested.

145
00:08:02.351 --> 00:08:06.007
I am. More than you know.

146
00:08:06.007 --> 00:08:08.226
All right. well.
there's just one thing.

147
00:08:08.226 --> 00:08:09.706
Are you sure you can balance

148
00:08:09.706 --> 00:08:12.187
being the Flash
with the added workload?

149
00:08:12.187 --> 00:08:14.929
It won't be a problem.

150
00:08:14.929 --> 00:08:16.234
Okay.

151
00:08:16.234 --> 00:08:18.367
Then I will call
the mayor's office

152
00:08:18.367 --> 00:08:20.282
and make a recommendation.

153
00:08:20.282 --> 00:08:21.413
Thank you.

154
00:08:21.413 --> 00:08:22.980
I really--
- Captain.

155
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.113
we've got a transport
under attack downtown.

156
00:08:25.113 --> 00:08:26.723
Mobile units to intercept.

157
00:09:03.455 --> 00:09:04.631
Hey. there.

158
00:09:04.631 --> 00:09:05.893
You must be new in town.

159
00:09:05.893 --> 00:09:08.460
I'm the Flash. And you are?

160
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.506
I'm your worst nightmare. dumbass.

161
00:09:10.506 --> 00:09:13.509
and please.
you can call me Captain.

162
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:15.598
You're Captain Boomerang.

163
00:09:15.598 --> 00:09:17.557
Well. look. it doesn't matter
how many sticks

164
00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.950
you throw at me. this ends
with you in Iron Heights.

165
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:21.604
You probably
have to kill me first.

166
00:09:21.604 --> 00:09:24.476
because I'm never going back
to that hellhole.

167
00:09:30.874 --> 00:09:32.223
<i>Flash. are you okay?</i>

168
00:09:32.223 --> 00:09:34.530
Yeah.
just getting my steps in.

169
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:35.879
We have a 411 on this guy?

170
00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:37.794
Yeah.
his name is Owen Mercer.

171
00:09:37.794 --> 00:09:39.143
He's been in and out
of Iron Heights

172
00:09:39.143 --> 00:09:40.667
since he was 19.

173
00:09:40.667 --> 00:09:42.233
Looks like he spent
most of his time there

174
00:09:42.233 --> 00:09:44.540
getting his butt kicked
by bigger inmates.

175
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:45.976
and now he's just
your run-of-the-mill baddie.

176
00:09:45.976 --> 00:09:48.283
Well. except for
the explosive hardware.

177
00:09:48.283 --> 00:09:49.806
Okay.

178
00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.206
Ahh!

179
00:10:00.861 --> 00:10:03.515
Flash. Mercer just teleported
out of there.

180
00:10:03.515 --> 00:10:06.170
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

181
00:10:07.781 --> 00:10:09.478
I guess we're not supposed
to catch him today.

182
00:10:09.478 --> 00:10:11.611
Uh. shouldn't we be worried
about a guy

183
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:14.396
with that kind of firepower
who jaunts on command?

184
00:10:14.396 --> 00:10:16.137
No.
We'll deal with it tomorrow.

185
00:10:16.137 --> 00:10:18.487
I got dinner plans with Iris.
You two get some rest.

186
00:10:20.097 --> 00:10:23.231
Did he just tell us to take
the rest of the day off?

187
00:10:23.231 --> 00:10:26.408
Yup. Yup.

188
00:10:34.851 --> 00:10:36.287
Babe. you okay?

189
00:10:36.287 --> 00:10:37.941
You seemed a little quiet
at dinner.

190
00:10:37.941 --> 00:10:40.335
Yeah. I'm just tired.

191
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:44.861
Did you know
about the CatCo offer?

192
00:10:44.861 --> 00:10:46.123
Yes. So I did.

193
00:10:46.123 --> 00:10:49.344
I figured it out using this.

194
00:10:49.344 --> 00:10:50.780
I call it my mapbook.

195
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.608
It's a record
I'm putting together

196
00:10:52.608 --> 00:10:54.697
of everything that's gonna
happen to us in the future.

197
00:11:01.835 --> 00:11:03.706
You're planning our future
without me?

198
00:11:03.706 --> 00:11:05.795
No. no. I'm cataloging it.

199
00:11:05.795 --> 00:11:07.188
Instead of changing
the timeline.

200
00:11:07.188 --> 00:11:08.668
we're just gonna follow it.

201
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.626
Catalog how?

202
00:11:10.626 --> 00:11:12.846
I mean. between everything
I've picked up time travelling

203
00:11:12.846 --> 00:11:14.412
and Gideon's records.

204
00:11:14.412 --> 00:11:17.285
we already know so much
about our future.

205
00:11:17.285 --> 00:11:20.462
I spent all week
putting it together.

206
00:11:20.462 --> 00:11:21.985
Why would you want
to do that?

207
00:11:23.944 --> 00:11:26.511
Look. um...

208
00:11:26.511 --> 00:11:28.078
I've been having
the same nightmare

209
00:11:28.078 --> 00:11:30.211
ever since we defeated
the negative forces.

210
00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:33.649
and in it.
I can't keep you safe.

211
00:11:33.649 --> 00:11:35.782
But with this book.

212
00:11:35.782 --> 00:11:38.393
we can see what's coming
before it happens.

213
00:11:38.393 --> 00:11:40.177
The good and bad.

214
00:11:40.177 --> 00:11:42.397
Like with Nora.

215
00:11:42.397 --> 00:11:43.703
Iris...

216
00:11:48.098 --> 00:11:51.449
You're gonna get pregnant
in three months.

217
00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:53.974
You're gonna win two Pulitzers!

218
00:11:53.974 --> 00:11:56.759
Like how great is this. right?

219
00:11:56.759 --> 00:11:58.935
Now we won't have to worry
about any Desperos

220
00:11:58.935 --> 00:12:00.981
or mirror dimensions
or time sickness

221
00:12:00.981 --> 00:12:02.504
catching us by surprise.

222
00:12:02.504 --> 00:12:04.462
We're safer now with this.

223
00:12:08.249 --> 00:12:09.816
What's wrong?

224
00:12:11.992 --> 00:12:14.777
Nothing. I'm just...

225
00:12:14.777 --> 00:12:16.605
tired.

226
00:12:19.216 --> 00:12:21.741
Can we just. um...

227
00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:25.962
talk about this tomorrow?

228
00:12:25.962 --> 00:12:27.659
Okay.

229
00:12:32.708 --> 00:12:34.754
Good night.
- Night.

230
00:13:02.869 --> 00:13:05.393
- Morning.
- Morning.

231
00:13:05.393 --> 00:13:08.178
Let's see if I catch
Captain Boomerang today.

232
00:13:11.225 --> 00:13:13.967
Hmm. Doesn't say.

233
00:13:13.967 --> 00:13:15.359
Ooh. that's happening
this weekend?

234
00:13:15.359 --> 00:13:17.448
Iris. guess what.
- Baby. please.

235
00:13:17.448 --> 00:13:20.016
Can you just take a shower
first?

236
00:13:20.016 --> 00:13:21.844
I'm still waking up.

237
00:13:21.844 --> 00:13:23.628
Yeah.
Yeah. I'll take a shower first.

238
00:13:23.628 --> 00:13:26.109
Then I'll tell you.
You're gonna love it.

239
00:13:34.552 --> 00:13:37.077
Babe. for the sake
of our marriage.

240
00:13:37.077 --> 00:13:39.731
could you please put
your smelly socks away?

241
00:13:39.731 --> 00:13:42.082
Sorry. thought I did!

242
00:13:48.871 --> 00:13:51.526
It's a new day.
You got this.

243
00:13:54.877 --> 00:13:56.400
So our online numbers
are up...

244
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.838
Up 8%. yes. Got it.

245
00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.535
So you do read
my spreadsheets. Cool.

246
00:14:00.535 --> 00:14:02.189
Also. Taylor is handling
our new--

247
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:04.539
New ad-free portal.

248
00:14:04.539 --> 00:14:08.804
- Yeah. but she also--
- Knows that you are a meta.

249
00:14:08.804 --> 00:14:10.632
Along with Aariz and Vanya.

250
00:14:10.632 --> 00:14:12.068
Allegra. we don't need
to go over this again.

251
00:14:12.068 --> 00:14:14.070
Hey. watch out.
- Ooh.

252
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.246
Oh. Iris. you're back.

253
00:14:16.246 --> 00:14:18.422
Great. 'cause we've got to do
something about--

254
00:14:18.422 --> 00:14:19.771
About our new filing system.

255
00:14:19.771 --> 00:14:21.817
I am working on it. Come on.

256
00:14:21.817 --> 00:14:23.645
Thanks. boss.

257
00:14:23.645 --> 00:14:25.255
What. are you psychic now?

258
00:14:25.255 --> 00:14:28.215
No. I'm just having
serious déjà vu.

259
00:14:28.215 --> 00:14:30.565
I know how to get you
out of that.

260
00:14:30.565 --> 00:14:31.958
I have a surprise for you.

261
00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:35.135
Something about
CatCo Media buying us?

262
00:14:35.135 --> 00:14:37.441
Did Kara tell you?
She promised to let me do it.

263
00:14:37.441 --> 00:14:39.400
No. Allegra.
we discussed this already.

264
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.663
We did?
Then why aren't you

265
00:14:41.663 --> 00:14:43.708
freaking out
that it's a blank check?

266
00:14:46.233 --> 00:14:48.931
- If I just say yes...
- Right.

267
00:14:48.931 --> 00:14:50.933
Iris. this is
your future empire.

268
00:14:50.933 --> 00:14:53.066
The one Nora and Bart are
always talking about.

269
00:14:53.066 --> 00:14:55.807
Don't say
this is how it starts

270
00:14:55.807 --> 00:14:59.942
or that this is where
I win my first Pulitzer.

271
00:14:59.942 --> 00:15:01.770
How'd you know
I was gonna say that?

272
00:15:03.424 --> 00:15:05.556
I don't know.

273
00:15:07.471 --> 00:15:10.910
Barry. what did you do
this time?

274
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.390
<i>So Director Siakim
is retiring.</i>

275
00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:16.132
<i>I wanted to talk to you about
putting a recommendation in</i>

276
00:15:16.132 --> 00:15:18.395
for you to replace him
if you're interested.

277
00:15:18.395 --> 00:15:21.833
What?
Captain. are you joking?

278
00:15:21.833 --> 00:15:23.923
You already recommended me.

279
00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.968
Well. not yet I haven't.

280
00:15:25.968 --> 00:15:27.491
Hold on.
Did you change your mind?

281
00:15:27.491 --> 00:15:29.580
You're not supposed
to change your mind.

282
00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.539
Really?

283
00:15:31.539 --> 00:15:34.411
Allen. I'm not sure that you're
ready for more responsibility.

284
00:15:34.411 --> 00:15:36.718
It seems like you may have
enough going on already.

285
00:15:36.718 --> 00:15:37.980
What do you mean?

286
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.851
That maybe being the Flash

287
00:15:39.851 --> 00:15:41.941
and a CSI
is enough on your plate.

288
00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:43.159
You can't take this back.

289
00:15:43.159 --> 00:15:44.856
It has to happen.
The book says so.

290
00:15:44.856 --> 00:15:49.296
Okay. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

291
00:15:49.296 --> 00:15:51.211
And watch your tone.

292
00:15:51.211 --> 00:15:52.560
We're done here.

293
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.301
Captain.
we've got a transport

294
00:15:54.301 --> 00:15:55.563
under attack downtown.

295
00:15:55.563 --> 00:15:57.347
Mobilize units to intercept.

296
00:16:00.176 --> 00:16:01.525
Allen.

297
00:16:06.313 --> 00:16:08.271
Ooh.

298
00:16:09.316 --> 00:16:11.057
Captain Boomerang. right?

299
00:16:11.057 --> 00:16:12.493
Didn't we do this already?

300
00:16:12.493 --> 00:16:14.451
Nope.
and since you know who I am.

301
00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:17.454
I'm sure you're aware
that I'm your worst nightmare.

302
00:16:17.454 --> 00:16:19.021
You said the same thing yesterday.

303
00:16:19.021 --> 00:16:21.545
Dumbass. we just met.
Just now.

304
00:16:21.545 --> 00:16:23.156
Let's skip to the fighting part

305
00:16:23.156 --> 00:16:24.940
so I can carve that stupid look
off your face.

306
00:16:32.513 --> 00:16:34.428
Barry.
did you time travel us?

307
00:16:34.428 --> 00:16:36.125
<i>If I did.
it wasn't on purpose.</i>

308
00:16:36.125 --> 00:16:38.780
Look. whatever's going on.
we'll figure it out.

309
00:16:55.405 --> 00:16:57.277
What? What just happened?

310
00:16:57.277 --> 00:16:58.887
I don't know.

311
00:16:58.887 --> 00:17:00.976
One second. I was
in the Cortex.

312
00:17:00.976 --> 00:17:04.023
and then there was
a white flash.

313
00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:06.547
and then I was in bed
with you.

314
00:17:06.547 --> 00:17:10.464
- I think I just died.
- What?

315
00:17:10.464 --> 00:17:13.989
How are you here?
How are we both here?

316
00:17:28.699 --> 00:17:30.527
both: We're in a time loop.

317
00:17:39.406 --> 00:17:41.103
It looks like Gideon's scans

318
00:17:41.103 --> 00:17:43.540
detected composite
temporal particles on you.

319
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:45.542
So does that mean
that my time sickness is back?

320
00:17:45.542 --> 00:17:48.545
No. but you have been exposed
to some kind

321
00:17:48.545 --> 00:17:51.200
of tachyon feedback loop.
Barry too.

322
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.680
And now. you're stuck on this

323
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.117
merry-go-round called Wednesday.

324
00:17:55.117 --> 00:17:57.337
It's called "Groundhog Day."

325
00:17:57.337 --> 00:18:00.253
Feedback loop over and over
like the movie.

326
00:18:00.253 --> 00:18:01.863
Anybody? Come on. guys.

327
00:18:01.863 --> 00:18:03.430
I can't be the only one
who's thinking this.

328
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:06.650
So this Owen Mercer.
what's his connection?

329
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.826
He robs a Kord Industries
truck every day.

330
00:18:08.826 --> 00:18:11.133
but I don't know why.
- Yo. check this out.

331
00:18:11.133 --> 00:18:13.179
So I just checked
Kord's database.

332
00:18:13.179 --> 00:18:15.137
Guess what they're
transporting today.

333
00:18:15.137 --> 00:18:16.921
A Roemer Accelerator.

334
00:18:16.921 --> 00:18:19.489
It's like a particle
accelerator. only portable.

335
00:18:19.489 --> 00:18:21.448
Barry. if your speed interacted
with this puppy.

336
00:18:21.448 --> 00:18:23.537
the reaction could've created
a temporal effect.

337
00:18:23.537 --> 00:18:24.886
like a time loop.

338
00:18:24.886 --> 00:18:26.540
Is there any way
to reverse it?

339
00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:27.932
Yeah. if we could get
our hands

340
00:18:27.932 --> 00:18:29.020
on whatever powers
the accelerator

341
00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.327
and analyze its components.

342
00:18:31.327 --> 00:18:33.112
we may be able to figure out
what chocolate

343
00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:35.070
is affecting
the proverbial peanut butter.

344
00:18:37.203 --> 00:18:39.727
Oh. where'd you get this?
- Kord Industries.

345
00:18:39.727 --> 00:18:42.033
While security was loading
the accelerator onto the truck.

346
00:18:42.033 --> 00:18:44.079
I searched the entire device
and found this inside.

347
00:18:44.079 --> 00:18:46.473
This is quantum-based
micro-circuitry.

348
00:18:46.473 --> 00:18:48.823
This is game-changing tech. yo.

349
00:18:48.823 --> 00:18:50.738
I'm gonna go get
the workshop ready.

350
00:18:50.738 --> 00:18:53.001
Barr. I'm gonna need
your help with this.

351
00:18:53.001 --> 00:18:55.046
- Yeah. okay.
- All right. well. we'll be

352
00:18:55.046 --> 00:18:56.483
standing by if you need
anything else. all right?

353
00:18:56.483 --> 00:18:58.702
- Yeah. see you.
- Mm-hmm.

354
00:18:58.702 --> 00:19:00.617
Barry. the day's already
repeated twice.

355
00:19:00.617 --> 00:19:01.966
- I know.
- What if this goes on forever?

356
00:19:01.966 --> 00:19:03.316
No. no. it won't.

357
00:19:03.316 --> 00:19:05.883
Chester and I
will find a way out.

358
00:19:05.883 --> 00:19:07.972
What do I do till then?

359
00:19:07.972 --> 00:19:10.845
Just do what you
always do today.

360
00:19:10.845 --> 00:19:12.281
Go to work. okay?

361
00:19:12.281 --> 00:19:14.283
Just go to work.
and it'll be fine.

362
00:19:14.283 --> 00:19:15.937
It's gonna be fine.

363
00:19:20.507 --> 00:19:22.073
<i>All you have to do

364
00:19:23.423 --> 00:19:25.251
Iris. this is
your future empire.

365
00:19:25.251 --> 00:19:27.731
This is how it starts.
- Let me think about it.

366
00:19:27.731 --> 00:19:29.690
Coffee?
- Okay. so

367
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:31.039
if we reverse-engineer

368
00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:32.693
the photon relays
inside this puppy.

369
00:19:32.693 --> 00:19:34.390
we should be able to trigger
a reaction

370
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:35.826
that'll negate the incursion.

371
00:19:35.826 --> 00:19:38.002
Okay.

372
00:19:38.002 --> 00:19:39.787

376

Let me guess: whatever you
and Chester did didn't work.

377
00:19:50.754 --> 00:19:51.929
Yeah. but don't worry.
we're not gonna make

378
00:19:51.929 --> 00:19:53.409
the same mistake twice.

379
00:19:53.409 --> 00:19:56.369
This is so simple.

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:03.463
What do you say?
- Not today.

384
00:20:03.463 --> 00:20:04.899
- What do you say?
- Not today.

385
00:20:04.899 --> 00:20:06.640
- What do you say?
- I say not today.

386
00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.816
Plus I need more time
to consider all the variables.

387
00:20:08.816 --> 00:20:12.211
And what I really want
is a cocktail.

388
00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:13.473
Hey. it's 5:00 somewhere.

- Nope.
- 15 times?

392
00:20:25.659 --> 00:20:27.313
We did this 15 times already?
- Yes.

393
00:20:27.313 --> 00:20:29.228
Guess I should probably keep
this suit on. huh?

394
00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:31.273
The Starchive walls are
3 feet thick.

395
00:20:31.273 --> 00:20:34.537
So I will very carefully
move it inside.

396
00:20:34.537 --> 00:20:36.713
and then we will use
a remote drone for analysis.

397
00:20:36.713 --> 00:20:39.150
Until then--
- Don't touch the battery.

Oh. thank God you're okay.

Yeah.

Absolutely nothing.

00:21:38.166 --> 00:21:40.299
Iris. I know how difficult
this is.

425
00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:42.823
but are you sure you should be
doing that right now?

426
00:21:42.823 --> 00:21:44.607
- Want a glass?
- Um--

427

'Cause it won't
really matter.

428
00:21:46.653 --> 00:21:48.176
I mean. obviously.
you weren't able to get

Iris. this is serious.

432
00:21:54.748 --> 00:21:58.142
And today. instead of being
forced into making

433
00:21:58.142 --> 00:22:00.231
a major decision.
one that...

434
00:22:00.231 --> 00:22:04.018
Seems to have already been
made for me somehow.

435
00:22:04.018 --> 00:22:08.588
I realized that I can do
whatever I want.

436
00:22:08.588 --> 00:22:10.198
I don't have to say yes.

00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:14.376
Merlot?

439
00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:16.639
That's it.

440
00:22:16.639 --> 00:22:19.033
Have you been saying no
to Cat Grant's offer?

441
00:22:20.164 --> 00:22:21.688
I haven't said either way.

442
00:22:21.688 --> 00:22:23.472
That's why we're stuck here.

443
00:22:23.472 --> 00:22:25.213
What if the time loop has
nothing to do with the battery?

444
00:22:25.213 --> 00:22:27.128
What if we're trapped here
until you say yes.

445
00:22:27.128 --> 00:22:29.086
like the book says?

446
00:22:29.086 --> 00:22:30.566
The mapbook says
I'm supposed to?

447
00:22:30.566 --> 00:22:33.047
Yes. You expand
to a second building.

448
00:22:33.047 --> 00:22:34.831
CCC Media grows exponentially.

449
00:22:34.831 --> 00:22:36.746
You get two Pulitzers.

450
00:22:36.746 --> 00:22:38.661
Don't you see?
You have to accept the offer.

451
00:22:38.661 --> 00:22:40.315
So what. now you want me
to just follow

452
00:22:40.315 --> 00:22:42.404
the mapbook's instructions
forever?

453
00:22:42.404 --> 00:22:43.840
I mean. if it's our way
out of here--

454
00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.755
Yeah. no thanks.

455
00:22:45.755 --> 00:22:47.409
Barry. if I have
to decide between

456
00:22:47.409 --> 00:22:49.324
following instructions
for the rest of my life

457
00:22:49.324 --> 00:22:51.718
or being stuck here
for the foreseeable future...

458
00:22:53.284 --> 00:22:54.503
Hmm.

459
00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:58.333
I'll have more Merlot. please.

460
00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:05.819
You want to stay
in a time loop?

461
00:23:05.819 --> 00:23:07.516
Yes. Right now. I do.

462
00:23:07.516 --> 00:23:10.432
because that mapbook
is not the answer. not for me.

463
00:23:10.432 --> 00:23:12.347
- Why not?
- Because I don't want to know

464
00:23:12.347 --> 00:23:14.784
everything that's gonna happen
and when it's gonna happen.

465
00:23:14.784 --> 00:23:17.004
It guarantees a future
where we're together and safe.

466
00:23:17.004 --> 00:23:18.875
Yes. in exchange
for our free will.

467
00:23:18.875 --> 00:23:20.790
Iris. it's not just
about today.

468
00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:23.010
I want tomorrow. too.
and the day after that

469
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:24.664
and the week after that
and everything else.

470
00:23:24.664 --> 00:23:27.057
I want all of it.
- Barry.

471
00:23:27.057 --> 00:23:28.755
Look.

472
00:23:28.755 --> 00:23:30.670
When I was lost
in the Still Force.

473
00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:33.499
bouncing between past.
present. and future.

474
00:23:33.499 --> 00:23:35.152
not knowing where
I would end up.

475
00:23:35.152 --> 00:23:37.372
that was my nightmare.

476
00:23:37.372 --> 00:23:38.895
And. look.
I know we're stuck here.

477
00:23:38.895 --> 00:23:41.071
but today is the first time
in a long time

478
00:23:41.071 --> 00:23:43.465
that I am not worrying
about anything.

479
00:23:43.465 --> 00:23:45.424
I am just living in the moment.

480
00:23:47.295 --> 00:23:49.950
Iris. I want to meet
our kids as babies.

481
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.824
And then grow old together.

482
00:23:54.824 --> 00:23:57.392
But if we don't follow
what's in this book.

483
00:23:57.392 --> 00:24:00.090
we don't get any of it.
- You don't know that.

484
00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:02.136
You don't know that.

485
00:24:02.136 --> 00:24:04.443
But don't you want
our future anymore?

486
00:24:04.443 --> 00:24:07.010
Yes. of course I do.

487
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:09.665
I just want to be able
to choose it.

488
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:16.150
I thought you already did.

489
00:24:19.719 --> 00:24:21.938
I need some air.

490
00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.538
Guess somebody else had
a bad day.

491
00:24:56.538 --> 00:24:57.626
Join us for dinner. son?

492
00:24:57.626 --> 00:24:58.888
Pasta carbonara. right?

493
00:24:58.888 --> 00:25:00.977
- How'd you know?
- Lucky guess.

494
00:25:02.413 --> 00:25:04.285
Lousy ending?

495
00:25:04.285 --> 00:25:05.634
I hate that too.

496
00:25:05.634 --> 00:25:07.157
No. the opposite.

497
00:25:07.157 --> 00:25:10.334
It's a perfect ending--
Iris' and mine.

498
00:25:10.334 --> 00:25:12.554
Is this book from 2049?

499
00:25:12.554 --> 00:25:13.947
No. I made it.

500
00:25:13.947 --> 00:25:16.863
It's a chronicle
of my future with Iris.

501
00:25:16.863 --> 00:25:18.342
Or was.

502
00:25:18.342 --> 00:25:19.996
Now I don't know
if we have one.

503
00:25:19.996 --> 00:25:21.520
You're gonna move
into this house?

504
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.825
Yeah.

505
00:25:22.825 --> 00:25:24.218
Yeah. yeah.
A couple years from now.

506
00:25:24.218 --> 00:25:26.263
Nora chips a tooth
on those stairs.

507
00:25:26.263 --> 00:25:27.613
And then right here
on this couch

508
00:25:27.613 --> 00:25:29.310
is where Bart says
his first word.

509
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:30.833
Barry.

510
00:25:30.833 --> 00:25:32.966
It sounds perfect.
- It is.

511
00:25:32.966 --> 00:25:35.011
It is. but Iris doesn't want
to be tied down

512
00:25:35.011 --> 00:25:36.970
by what's in this book.
so she's willing to risk

513
00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:38.580
letting it all go.

514
00:25:41.583 --> 00:25:44.412
And you're afraid of losing
her again. aren't you?

515
00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:48.459
I mean. these last few years.

516
00:25:48.459 --> 00:25:51.811
her time sickness.
the mirror universe. the--

517
00:25:53.726 --> 00:25:57.730
I mean. when I thought
Thawne killed her...

518
00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:00.123
my whole world fell apart.

519
00:26:00.123 --> 00:26:01.472
So when I got her back.

520
00:26:01.472 --> 00:26:02.909
I swore I would do
whatever I could

521
00:26:02.909 --> 00:26:05.389
to make sure that
we always had a future.

522
00:26:07.653 --> 00:26:09.872
You made this book yourself?

523
00:26:09.872 --> 00:26:11.526
Yeah.

524
00:26:11.526 --> 00:26:12.962
And I'm guessing
you collected

525
00:26:12.962 --> 00:26:14.660
all the facts
you possibly could.

526
00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:17.140
Just like a good detective.

527
00:26:18.533 --> 00:26:20.187
Barry.

528
00:26:20.187 --> 00:26:22.668
this book of yours may predict

529
00:26:22.668 --> 00:26:27.107
a future where Iris
is safe with you.

530
00:26:27.107 --> 00:26:29.892
but is she happy?

531
00:26:29.892 --> 00:26:32.678
Because one thing
this book doesn't do

532
00:26:32.678 --> 00:26:38.379
is tell you why things happened
the way they did.

533
00:26:38.379 --> 00:26:43.993
And it damn sure can't tell you
how people feel about it.

534
00:26:43.993 --> 00:26:46.561
Barry. honey. Joe's right.

535
00:26:46.561 --> 00:26:48.955
The future isn't something
that you can map out

536
00:26:48.955 --> 00:26:50.391
and put in a book.

537
00:26:50.391 --> 00:26:54.351
The future is something
that you...

538
00:26:54.351 --> 00:26:58.225
it's something that you create

539
00:26:58.225 --> 00:27:00.357
with the people that you love.

540
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:27.036
You've been gone all day.

541
00:27:27.036 --> 00:27:31.562
I had a lot to think about.

542
00:27:31.562 --> 00:27:34.827
- I haven't changed my mind.
- You don't have to.

543
00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:39.614
This book.

544
00:27:39.614 --> 00:27:42.704
it's a love story.

545
00:27:42.704 --> 00:27:46.055
but it's just a story.

546
00:27:46.055 --> 00:27:48.492
The real thing.
that's you and me.

547
00:27:48.492 --> 00:27:51.931
and that's all we need.
It's all I need.

548
00:27:51.931 --> 00:27:54.803
Which is why I want to just

549
00:27:54.803 --> 00:27:59.765
appreciate every second
of our lives

550
00:27:59.765 --> 00:28:02.115
while it's happening

551
00:28:02.115 --> 00:28:05.814
with you.

552
00:28:05.814 --> 00:28:10.297
Even if we repeat
the same day forever?

553
00:28:10.297 --> 00:28:12.821
What's better
than living out eternity

554
00:28:12.821 --> 00:28:15.258
with the most incredible woman
on the planet?

555
00:28:22.439 --> 00:28:23.789
Wait.

556
00:28:28.054 --> 00:28:29.664
Are you sure about that?

557
00:28:33.276 --> 00:28:35.278
I'm sure about you.

558
00:28:37.367 --> 00:28:39.326
Whatever happens next...

559
00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:44.548
We'll do it together.

560
00:29:15.449 --> 00:29:18.757
- Morning.
- Mm.

561
00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:21.498
Morning.
- You ready for this?

562
00:29:24.588 --> 00:29:25.938
Let's have some fun.

563
00:29:28.941 --> 00:29:31.204
Iris. I'm so glad
you're back.

564
00:29:31.204 --> 00:29:32.814
Boy. we've got to do something...

565
00:29:32.814 --> 00:29:34.903
- About the new filing system.
- Poppy seed?

566
00:29:34.903 --> 00:29:37.732
Oh. yeah. That's my favorite.

567
00:29:37.732 --> 00:29:39.255
Iris. let me get you
up to speed.

568
00:29:39.255 --> 00:29:41.344
On your big surprise. Yes.

569
00:29:41.344 --> 00:29:44.086
Want to hand these out?
Thanks.

570
00:29:44.086 --> 00:29:45.827
Wait. What?

571
00:29:45.827 --> 00:29:47.524
How did you know it was
supposed to be a surprise?

572
00:29:47.524 --> 00:29:49.875
So I already know
about Cat Grant's offer.

573
00:29:49.875 --> 00:29:52.878
and I am good with expanding
my media footprint.

574
00:29:52.878 --> 00:29:54.357
- You are?
- She is.

575
00:29:54.357 --> 00:29:57.578
But I am expanding it
in my own way.

576
00:29:57.578 --> 00:29:59.406
This is the start
of my future empire.

577
00:29:59.406 --> 00:30:01.800
the one that Bart and Nora
are always talking about.

578
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.106
so I've already talked
to Sue Dearbon.

579
00:30:04.106 --> 00:30:06.152
and she is going to give CCC

580
00:30:06.152 --> 00:30:09.329
a loan to buy
the "Coast City Gazette."

581
00:30:09.329 --> 00:30:11.200
They're staff is already
experiencing layoffs.

582
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.203
so we can bring in their unique
voices under our umbrella.

583
00:30:14.203 --> 00:30:16.031
Not CatCo's.

584
00:30:16.031 --> 00:30:17.990
Okay. Wow.

585
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:19.556
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

586
00:30:19.556 --> 00:30:21.820
Ooh. we still have
a few hours to kill.

587
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.125
Well. whatever shall we do

588
00:30:23.125 --> 00:30:24.431
with all of our time.
Mr. Allen?

589
00:30:24.431 --> 00:30:27.042
I don't know.

590
00:30:27.042 --> 00:30:28.348
You guys okay?

591
00:30:28.348 --> 00:30:30.829
Sorry. Yeah.
You want to?

592
00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:31.873
See ya.

593
00:30:33.875 --> 00:30:35.834
Cannonball!

594
00:30:54.026 --> 00:30:55.592
This is way better
than a coffee break.

595
00:30:55.592 --> 00:30:57.377
How much time do we have?

596
00:30:57.377 --> 00:31:00.467
- Enough to get a refill.
- Mm.

597
00:31:00.467 --> 00:31:02.556
See my cannonball?

598
00:31:02.556 --> 00:31:04.166
- I saw your cannonball.
- It was good. right?

599
00:31:04.166 --> 00:31:05.776
- It was really good.
- Did you see the splash?

600
00:31:05.776 --> 00:31:07.213
- I did see the--
- It was a big splash. right?

601
00:31:07.213 --> 00:31:09.084
- It was a big splash.
- Yeah.

602
00:31:09.084 --> 00:31:10.433
I don't know.

603
00:31:10.433 --> 00:31:11.521
The director position
comes with

604
00:31:11.521 --> 00:31:12.696
a pretty heavy workload.

605
00:31:12.696 --> 00:31:14.002
And you're wondering if I can

606
00:31:14.002 --> 00:31:15.177
balance it
with being the Flash.

607
00:31:15.177 --> 00:31:17.832
I'll make sure he does.

608
00:31:17.832 --> 00:31:20.966
Okay.
I will call the mayor's office

609
00:31:20.966 --> 00:31:23.751
and make my recommendation.
- Thanks. Captain.

610
00:31:23.751 --> 00:31:25.666
Got to run. Mercer's gonna be
right on time.

611
00:31:25.666 --> 00:31:27.494
Who's Mercer?

612
00:31:27.494 --> 00:31:28.974
<i>Chester. Owen Mercer's
attacking</i>

613
00:31:28.974 --> 00:31:30.410
<i>a Kord Industries convoy.</i>

614
00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:33.239
<i>but don't worry.
I've got a plan.</i>

615
00:31:33.239 --> 00:31:35.241
Barr. are you
part-Nostradamus?

616
00:31:35.241 --> 00:31:36.633
Yeah. how'd you know
it was Mercer?

617
00:31:36.633 --> 00:31:37.983
<i>I'll tell you later.</i>

618
00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:41.290
I was hoping
you'd show up. Flash.

619
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.205
Right 'cause you like fighting

620
00:31:43.205 --> 00:31:45.425
ever since you got roughed up
over and over at Iron Heights.

621
00:31:45.425 --> 00:31:47.470
Now. you need to prove you're
the new big rogue on campus.

622
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:49.646
Blah. blah. blah.
- Shut up!

623
00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.961
Okay.

624
00:32:05.706 --> 00:32:07.142
Ow!

625
00:32:07.142 --> 00:32:08.796
- I'd stay back if I were you.
- Yeah.

626
00:32:08.796 --> 00:32:10.841
I got ya. I got ya. I got ya.
- Iris?

627
00:32:10.841 --> 00:32:12.974
Didn't want to miss out
on the fun.

628
00:32:12.974 --> 00:32:14.845
It's two against one. Mercer.

629
00:32:14.845 --> 00:32:16.456
You're going back
to Iron Heights.

630
00:32:16.456 --> 00:32:18.632
Yeah. I'm sorry about that. Flashy.

631
00:32:18.632 --> 00:32:21.156
I promised myself I'd never go
back to that hellhole.

632
00:32:21.156 --> 00:32:24.638
and there is one thing you
don't know about me.

633
00:32:24.638 --> 00:32:26.379
I always have a comeback.

634
00:32:26.379 --> 00:32:27.858
I'm picking up
a fusion signature

635
00:32:27.858 --> 00:32:30.600
inside the accelerator.

636
00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.038
Oh. man. He has a tactical nuke
inside that thing.

637
00:32:33.038 --> 00:32:35.475
- You set off a nuclear bomb?
- Yeah.

638
00:32:35.475 --> 00:32:39.914
- Millions of people could die.
- That's true.

639
00:32:39.914 --> 00:32:41.785
Not really my problem. though.
is it?

640
00:32:45.572 --> 00:32:47.748
Barry. you have to get
that machine out of here.

641
00:32:47.748 --> 00:32:50.011
<i>- Barry. you can't.
- She's right. Barry.</i>

642
00:32:50.011 --> 00:32:51.360
The fusion buildup
I'm picking up

643
00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.796
is going to be hella volatile.

644
00:32:52.796 --> 00:32:54.320
If you try and move
the accelerator.

645
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.626
it could explode.

646
00:32:56.626 --> 00:33:00.674
Barry. we have maybe 20 seconds
to stop this before...

647
00:33:00.674 --> 00:33:02.415
I said yes.
I don't understand.

648
00:33:02.415 --> 00:33:04.025
I know.

649
00:33:04.025 --> 00:33:06.288
We had the best day ever.
but it's not over yet.

650
00:33:08.247 --> 00:33:11.337
Ten. nine.

651
00:33:11.337 --> 00:33:13.948
<i>eight. seven.</i>

652
00:33:13.948 --> 00:33:16.298
<i>six. five.</i>

653
00:33:16.298 --> 00:33:18.779
<i>four. three.</i>

654
00:33:18.779 --> 00:33:21.173
two. one.

655
00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:24.627
Oh. my God.

656
00:34:24.627 --> 00:34:27.717
The Flash did it.
We're frakkin' alive. baby.

657
00:34:27.717 --> 00:34:29.241
Yeah.

658
00:34:29.241 --> 00:34:31.460
We're alive.
- We're alive.

659
00:34:59.271 --> 00:35:00.576
Uh...

660
00:35:15.765 --> 00:35:17.637
You still having fun.
Mrs. West-Allen?

661
00:35:19.726 --> 00:35:21.249
With you?

662
00:35:21.249 --> 00:35:23.121
Always. Mr. Allen.

663
00:35:36.308 --> 00:35:38.048
<i>Thank God it's Thursday.</i>

664
00:35:38.048 --> 00:35:39.876
<i>You wouldn't believe
all the stuff we tried.</i>

665
00:35:39.876 --> 00:35:41.443
Once we even tried connecting

666
00:35:41.443 --> 00:35:43.750
the battery
to the particle accelerator.

667
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:46.361
After 58 time loops. you kind
of throw caution to the wind.

668
00:35:46.361 --> 00:35:48.233
And apparently
you learned how to phase

669
00:35:48.233 --> 00:35:50.713
through a nuclear blast
mid-explosion.

670
00:35:50.713 --> 00:35:53.803
58 time loops?
Didn't that get boring?

671
00:35:53.803 --> 00:35:55.892
It was kind of romantic.

672
00:35:55.892 --> 00:35:57.633
Aw.

673
00:35:59.983 --> 00:36:01.985
So how'd you guys get out?

674
00:36:01.985 --> 00:36:04.336
Living the day apart
didn't work.

675
00:36:04.336 --> 00:36:07.991
so we lived it together.
the right way.

676
00:36:07.991 --> 00:36:10.211
And then let the time line
correct itself.

677
00:36:10.211 --> 00:36:13.214
Phasing. explosions.
time loops.

678
00:36:13.214 --> 00:36:18.001
You have been through a lot
in nine years.

679
00:36:18.001 --> 00:36:19.220
You both have.

680
00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.179
And I'm very proud of you.

681
00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:23.224
Thanks. Dad.
Sue's calling.

682
00:36:23.224 --> 00:36:24.834
I'm gonna take this outside.

683
00:36:24.834 --> 00:36:26.793
Hi. Sue. What's going on?

684
00:36:26.793 --> 00:36:28.273
So Owen Mercer--

685
00:36:28.273 --> 00:36:29.622
he still got away
with that battery.

686
00:36:29.622 --> 00:36:31.145
The satellites are scanning.

687
00:36:31.145 --> 00:36:32.581
so as soon as he turns up.
we'll get him.

688
00:36:32.581 --> 00:36:33.974
Pinning down a bad guy
that can teleport.

689
00:36:33.974 --> 00:36:35.541
That's gonna be tough.

690
00:36:35.541 --> 00:36:38.544
Yeah and how's
a boomerang-wielding psycho

691
00:36:38.544 --> 00:36:41.329
suddenly a tech genius?
It doesn't make sense.

692
00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:43.026
He has a partner.

693
00:36:43.026 --> 00:36:47.117
Someone who is the brains
to his brawn.

694
00:36:47.117 --> 00:36:48.815
Yeah. but who?

695
00:36:52.471 --> 00:36:55.213
Thanks for everything. Sue.
You are the best.

696
00:36:55.213 --> 00:36:56.431
And when you get back in town.

697
00:36:56.431 --> 00:36:58.346
we will celebrate
with a bottle.

698
00:36:58.346 --> 00:37:00.957
Or two. Okay. bye.

699
00:37:04.874 --> 00:37:06.876
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

700
00:37:06.876 --> 00:37:09.705
- Yeah?
- Everything is more than okay.

701
00:37:09.705 --> 00:37:13.753
"Coast City Gazette" is now
a part of the CCC Media empire.

702
00:37:13.753 --> 00:37:15.407
I got everything
the book said I would.

703
00:37:15.407 --> 00:37:17.235
except I did it
on my own terms.

704
00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:18.540
That's great.

705
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.630
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.

706
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:24.633
So I've been thinking
about what you said.

707
00:37:24.633 --> 00:37:26.287
how we should write
our own future

708
00:37:26.287 --> 00:37:28.202
and enjoy every moment.

709
00:37:28.202 --> 00:37:30.248
These last few years.
you know. it feels like

710
00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:33.076
we've spent so much time
saving the world.

711
00:37:33.076 --> 00:37:38.386
We never really got that
classic newlywed experience.

712
00:37:38.386 --> 00:37:41.520
Yeah. I know. I'm gonna be
pregnant in three months.

713
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.827
Feels like we just can't
catch a break.

714
00:37:44.827 --> 00:37:47.439
So let's make one. Together.

715
00:37:49.832 --> 00:37:54.184
So what? You're suggesting
a baby-moon adventure?

716
00:37:54.184 --> 00:37:57.797
Only let's not wait
until the third trimester.

717
00:37:57.797 --> 00:38:00.756
Just start right now.

718
00:38:00.756 --> 00:38:03.324
Okay.

719
00:38:03.324 --> 00:38:05.108
- Okay.
- Okay.

720
00:38:11.332 --> 00:38:12.725
I did it.

721
00:38:12.725 --> 00:38:14.683
Joe. I did it.
Oh. let all tires

722
00:38:14.683 --> 00:38:17.425
near and far be warned.
'cause baby. I did it.

723
00:38:17.425 --> 00:38:19.297
I knew you could. babe.

724
00:38:23.605 --> 00:38:25.346
Okay.

725
00:38:25.346 --> 00:38:30.395
Okay. okay. you've been
super anxious all day.

726
00:38:30.395 --> 00:38:31.961
and you're not telling me
what's going on.

727
00:38:31.961 --> 00:38:35.661
I know it's not
about my football skills.

728
00:38:35.661 --> 00:38:37.010
What's the deal?

729
00:38:41.536 --> 00:38:43.886
Nine years
in this superhero life.

730
00:38:43.886 --> 00:38:46.062
That's how long it's been. Cecile.

731
00:38:46.062 --> 00:38:48.326
And don't get me wrong.
it's been

732
00:38:48.326 --> 00:38:52.242
equal parts incredible
and terrifying.

733
00:38:52.242 --> 00:38:54.462
And it will be
even more incredible

734
00:38:54.462 --> 00:38:56.943
with your new abilities.

735
00:38:56.943 --> 00:38:59.162
I'm sensing a but coming.

736
00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:04.646
It makes me ask

737
00:39:04.646 --> 00:39:07.301
what's next for us?

738
00:39:07.301 --> 00:39:09.651
Not just you and me.

739
00:39:09.651 --> 00:39:11.958
for our whole family.

740
00:39:14.264 --> 00:39:16.092
Joe. what are you saying?

741
00:39:21.533 --> 00:39:23.970
I think we should leave
Central City.

742
00:39:47.602 --> 00:39:49.822
Caitlin. I got your alert.
What's wrong?

743
00:39:53.782 --> 00:39:54.827
Caitlin?

744
00:39:59.614 --> 00:40:01.094
Frost. is that you?

745
00:40:04.358 --> 00:40:08.536
I'm neither.
I'm afraid.

746
00:40:08.536 --> 00:40:11.191
And I'm sorry to meet you
like this. but...

747
00:40:11.191 --> 00:40:14.107
I'm glad you came.

748
00:40:14.107 --> 00:40:16.283
You sent that alert?

749
00:40:16.283 --> 00:40:19.242
From Caitlin's phone. yes.

750
00:40:19.242 --> 00:40:23.333
This is strange. I know.
but I'll explain everything.

751
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:28.469
If you're not Frost
or Caitlin.

752
00:40:28.469 --> 00:40:29.775
then who are you?

753
00:40:41.743 --> 00:40:44.398
All that for this. huh?

754
00:40:44.398 --> 00:40:46.879
Sure it was worth it. 'cause
I'm kind of. you know.

755
00:40:46.879 --> 00:40:49.838
running out of boomerangs.

756
00:40:56.628 --> 00:40:58.020
Hello?

757
00:41:01.937 --> 00:41:02.982
Creepy.

758
00:41:07.508 --> 00:41:10.032
Oh. now that's
what I'm talking about.

759
00:41:13.819 --> 00:41:15.473
Fine.

760
00:41:15.473 --> 00:41:16.691
What's our next move?

761
00:41:16.691 --> 00:41:18.345
Not what.

762
00:41:18.345 --> 00:41:21.348
Who.

763
00:41:21.348 --> 00:41:24.482
The Flash is never truly alone.

764
00:41:24.482 --> 00:41:26.658
but once I'm done with him.

765
00:41:26.658 --> 00:41:29.095
he will be.

766
00:41:58.907 --> 00:42:00.474
Greg. move your head.
