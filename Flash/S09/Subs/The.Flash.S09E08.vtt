<i>Intruder alert.
All units respond.</i>

2
00:01:17.164 --> 00:01:21.081
And we are done.

3
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.649
What do you think?
Think Nora's gonna like it?

4
00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.567
Well. you can ask her
yourself in seven months.

5
00:01:29.567 --> 00:01:31.439
I know. I know.
I'm jumping the gun.

6
00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.136
I just--I can't wait
to be a dad.

7
00:01:33.136 --> 00:01:34.572
Is that why there's a freezer

8
00:01:34.572 --> 00:01:36.487
full of cookie dough ice cream?

9
00:01:36.487 --> 00:01:37.967
That's Nora's favorite.

10
00:01:37.967 --> 00:01:39.969
- Yeah. when she's 23.
- Yeah.

11
00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:41.666
Ooh. you know what I could
go for right now

12
00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:43.233
is some of that--

13
00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:45.366
Vanilla bean
from that organic dairy farm

14
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:47.237
in Coast City?

15
00:01:47.237 --> 00:01:50.371
Yes.
- Yeah.

16
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:53.896
Actually. that reminds me...
for you.

17
00:01:59.902 --> 00:02:02.644
No way.

18
00:02:02.644 --> 00:02:04.602
Iris. this is
in mint condition.

19
00:02:04.602 --> 00:02:06.387
How did you find this?
I've been looking for a copy

20
00:02:06.387 --> 00:02:08.040
ever since I lost my dad's
as a kid.

21
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.955
Enjoy.

22
00:02:09.955 --> 00:02:11.827
I mean. I can't believe
you did this.

23
00:02:11.827 --> 00:02:13.481
I mentioned it once
six months ago.

24
00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:16.310
And that's how we do. boo.

25
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.399
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

26
00:02:21.315 --> 00:02:23.882
I gotta go.
I scheduled a mold inspection

27
00:02:23.882 --> 00:02:25.493
so it was safe to bring Nora
to work with us.

28
00:02:25.493 --> 00:02:27.059
But is having a stranger

29
00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:28.452
wandering around S.T.A.R. Labs
a good idea?

30
00:02:28.452 --> 00:02:29.801
I mean.
the Starchives are sealed.

31
00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:31.499
and I had Chester
and Khione store

32
00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:33.631
all the other Team Flash stuff
in the Time Vault.

33
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:35.459
Well. just make sure
you bring me

34
00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.157
some of Cecile's
leftover casserole.

35
00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.593
Done deal.
See you in a few hours.

36
00:02:38.593 --> 00:02:39.724
All right.

37
00:02:45.295 --> 00:02:48.646
Trust me.
I know Carla Tannhauser.

38
00:02:48.646 --> 00:02:50.300
You have nothing
to worry about.

39
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.346
But I don't know her.

40
00:02:52.346 --> 00:02:54.652
Don't get me wrong. I'm touched
that she wants to meet me.

41
00:02:54.652 --> 00:02:56.306
but I'm not her daughter.

42
00:02:56.306 --> 00:02:58.221
Well. neither was Frost.
and Carla loved her

43
00:02:58.221 --> 00:02:59.962
the same as she loved Caitlin.

44
00:02:59.962 --> 00:03:01.833
She probably just wants
to get to know you better.

45
00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:04.227
What if I say something wrong

46
00:03:04.227 --> 00:03:05.489
and then things get awkward?

47
00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.578
She might walk out...

48
00:03:07.578 --> 00:03:09.798
like Mark did.

49
00:03:11.887 --> 00:03:15.586
Look. Khione. I know how much
it must have hurt

50
00:03:15.586 --> 00:03:17.719
having Mark walk out on you.

51
00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:21.940
and I don't know how things
are gonna go with Carla.

52
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.378
Just go and have coffee.

53
00:03:24.378 --> 00:03:27.119
See what happens.

54
00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:29.209
I just got an alert
that the mold inspector

55
00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.340
checked in with security.

56
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.863
Great.

57
00:03:31.863 --> 00:03:33.038
You sure you don't want us
to stick around?

58
00:03:33.038 --> 00:03:35.215
No. it's your day off. Relax.

59
00:03:37.695 --> 00:03:39.393
I'm the Flash.

60
00:03:39.393 --> 00:03:42.004
I'm pretty sure I can handle
one mold inspector.

61
00:03:55.583 --> 00:03:58.716
- Mr. Allen. I take it?
- Yes.

62
00:03:58.716 --> 00:04:00.805
Are you all here to find mold?

63
00:04:00.805 --> 00:04:03.068
Negative. broseph.
Mold's my turf.

64
00:04:03.068 --> 00:04:04.505
But when you hit me up...

65
00:04:04.505 --> 00:04:06.637
It alerted Code Enforcement.

66
00:04:06.637 --> 00:04:08.857
This lab's operating permits
haven't been renewed

67
00:04:08.857 --> 00:04:11.425
since your infamous
particle accelerator exploded.

68
00:04:11.425 --> 00:04:12.861
- Oh.
- That's why we'll be

69
00:04:12.861 --> 00:04:15.211
conducting a full
DOE inspection today.

70
00:04:15.211 --> 00:04:18.432
Okay.

71
00:04:18.432 --> 00:04:20.738
What are you looking for
besides mold?

72
00:04:20.738 --> 00:04:23.088
I'll be measuring
and studying any device energy

73
00:04:23.088 --> 00:04:27.615
or matter that emits
ionized radiation or particles.

74
00:04:27.615 --> 00:04:29.443
It looks like you have
a lot of that around here.

75
00:04:29.443 --> 00:04:31.358
- Yeah. well--
- And I'm here to check out

76
00:04:31.358 --> 00:04:33.098
all of your electrical.

77
00:04:35.492 --> 00:04:38.234
Sure--yeah. I guess
let's get started. then.

78
00:04:38.234 --> 00:04:39.801
Oh. hi...

79
00:04:39.801 --> 00:04:41.455
- Hi.
- Everybody.

80
00:04:41.455 --> 00:04:44.414
Ooh. That smells delicious.

81
00:04:44.414 --> 00:04:45.807
I'm sorry. and you are?

82
00:04:45.807 --> 00:04:47.417
Hungry.

83
00:04:47.417 --> 00:04:48.897
And you are?

84
00:04:48.897 --> 00:04:50.246
Inspector Howard.

85
00:04:50.246 --> 00:04:52.030
Inspector Howard.
this is my wife.

86
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.989
Iris West-Allen.

87
00:04:53.989 --> 00:04:56.513
She's here.
- Fantastic.

88
00:04:56.513 --> 00:04:57.601
Can we start now?

89
00:04:57.601 --> 00:04:59.603
Sure.

90
00:04:59.603 --> 00:05:01.344
You know what.
just straight down this hall

91
00:05:01.344 --> 00:05:04.695
to the Speed Lab.
two lefts and a right.

92
00:05:04.695 --> 00:05:06.741
I'll be with you in a minute.

93
00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:10.397
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

94
00:05:10.397 --> 00:05:11.789
My bad.

95
00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.791
I thought you were
resting at home.

96
00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:16.011
Oh. um. yeah.

97
00:05:16.011 --> 00:05:17.839
I just--I couldn't wait
for my casserole.

98
00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:19.406
- Ah.
- Yeah.

99
00:05:19.406 --> 00:05:21.364
So what's up
with the City Hall gang?

100
00:05:21.364 --> 00:05:23.540
Apparently.
a mold inspection triggers

101
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.760
every other
city inspection too.

102
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.763
which is way more prying eyes
than I expected.

103
00:05:28.763 --> 00:05:30.504
Let me help.

104
00:05:30.504 --> 00:05:33.681
No. look. I know people
like this chief guy.

105
00:05:33.681 --> 00:05:36.031
and he's just itching
for a reason to shut us down.

106
00:05:36.031 --> 00:05:37.467
I can tell.

107
00:05:37.467 --> 00:05:39.295
You sure you don't mind?
I mean--

108
00:05:39.295 --> 00:05:42.385
Handling bureaucratic
jackassery is. like. my thing.

109
00:05:42.385 --> 00:05:44.256
- Okay.
- We got this.

110
00:05:45.954 --> 00:05:47.564
Mr. Allen.

111
00:05:47.564 --> 00:05:49.914
Inspector. sir.

112
00:05:59.924 --> 00:06:01.622
Oh!

113
00:06:01.622 --> 00:06:03.841
Whoa. whoo!

114
00:06:03.841 --> 00:06:07.367
Oh.

115
00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.153
No mold up there. man.

116
00:06:11.153 --> 00:06:12.676
Oh.

117
00:06:12.676 --> 00:06:14.025
- Could've told him that.
- Great.

118
00:06:14.025 --> 00:06:15.940
- Whoo!
- Is this ramp used

119
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.116
for declivity
or purely entertainment?

120
00:06:18.116 --> 00:06:19.814
Oh...

121
00:06:19.814 --> 00:06:21.729
- Both?
- Both.

122
00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:24.993
So your thing with
the electrical stuff in it?

123
00:06:24.993 --> 00:06:28.300
Thing with all the elec--
uh. the breaker box?

124
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.607
Right. the breaker box.

125
00:06:30.607 --> 00:06:32.174
Breaker--it's in the--

126
00:06:32.174 --> 00:06:34.785
What's a Speed Lab for. anyway?

127
00:06:34.785 --> 00:06:36.483
Oh. well--

128
00:06:36.483 --> 00:06:38.963
You know. it's crazy
'cause we--

129
00:06:38.963 --> 00:06:40.835
as big as this place is.
we actually really don't spend

130
00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:42.489
a lot of time in here. right?

131
00:06:42.489 --> 00:06:43.968
- Hardly ever.
- Hardly ever.

132
00:06:43.968 --> 00:06:47.494
So I feel like
we should just move on.

133
00:06:47.494 --> 00:06:49.104
Yeah?

134
00:06:49.104 --> 00:06:51.802
Yeah.

135
00:06:51.802 --> 00:06:53.064
Fine.

136
00:06:53.064 --> 00:06:55.284
- Yeah?
- Let's go. folks.

137
00:06:55.284 --> 00:06:57.025
Let's go. folks.

138
00:06:59.941 --> 00:07:01.899
Electrician's unusual.

139
00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:04.075
Yeah. if you ask me.
they all seem like

140
00:07:04.075 --> 00:07:06.034
characters from a sitcom.

141
00:07:06.034 --> 00:07:08.166
"Inspectors."
coming this fall.

142
00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:15.870
Okay. breaker box is
just right over here.

143
00:07:24.792 --> 00:07:27.011
We just left this room.

144
00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:29.753
What are you trying to pull?

145
00:07:29.753 --> 00:07:32.756
We...

146
00:07:32.756 --> 00:07:35.063
we must have
taken a wrong turn.

147
00:07:35.063 --> 00:07:36.978
In your own facility?

148
00:07:36.978 --> 00:07:40.285
Okay. this is super trippy.

149
00:07:40.285 --> 00:07:41.852
Not sure I would have
phrased it that way.

150
00:07:41.852 --> 00:07:43.724
but I concur.

151
00:07:43.724 --> 00:07:45.073
Allen. I hate shenanigans.

152
00:07:45.073 --> 00:07:46.204
If this is
some kind of a joke--

153
00:07:46.204 --> 00:07:48.163
Joke? No. No.

154
00:07:48.163 --> 00:07:50.295
Barry's not even a funny guy.
like. at all.

155
00:07:50.295 --> 00:07:51.993
I mean. this stuff happens
all the time. right?

156
00:07:51.993 --> 00:07:53.690
I mean. this place is so big.
we get lost in here.

157
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.518
what. once. twice a day?

158
00:07:55.518 --> 00:07:57.041
Yeah. or every
couple of hours.

159
00:07:57.041 --> 00:07:58.565
Every couple of hours.

160
00:07:58.565 --> 00:08:00.784
- It's a real labyrinth.
- It's a real labyrinth.

161
00:08:00.784 --> 00:08:03.134
So...

162
00:08:03.134 --> 00:08:04.571
Yeah. it's just here.

163
00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:05.963
- Yes.
- Sorry. Excuse me.

164
00:08:05.963 --> 00:08:07.269
I'll just squeeze
right by you.

165
00:08:07.269 --> 00:08:08.966
Here we go. Yeah.

166
00:08:11.229 --> 00:08:13.710
Okay. so sorry about that.

167
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:14.929
Here we go. Just--

168
00:08:18.106 --> 00:08:20.195
You've gotta be kidding me.

169
00:08:20.195 --> 00:08:22.502
No. no. no. no. no. no.

170
00:08:24.634 --> 00:08:26.984
All right. what in
the H-E-double hockey sticks

171
00:08:26.984 --> 00:08:30.031
is going on here?

172
00:08:30.031 --> 00:08:33.513
Honestly. no idea.

173
00:08:35.036 --> 00:08:36.254
Don't look at me.

174
00:08:36.254 --> 00:08:38.387
Don't know.

175
00:08:38.387 --> 00:08:41.782
Whoa. was that there before?

176
00:08:48.832 --> 00:08:50.399
No.

177
00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:52.314
I have excellent
spatial retention.

178
00:08:52.314 --> 00:08:54.664
I can say with near certainty

179
00:08:54.664 --> 00:08:58.581
that grandfather clock was
not here before.

180
00:08:58.581 --> 00:09:00.365
Barry.

181
00:09:00.365 --> 00:09:03.499
how did a grandfather clock
get into the Speed Lab?

182
00:09:03.499 --> 00:09:05.196
I don't know.

183
00:09:05.196 --> 00:09:07.068
And why can't we get
out of this room?

184
00:09:07.068 --> 00:09:08.765
I don't know.

185
00:09:21.865 --> 00:09:25.913
This would fetch a lot
at the "Antiques Roadshow."

186
00:09:25.913 --> 00:09:30.482
It's from the 19th century. only...

187
00:09:30.482 --> 00:09:32.876
it looks like
it was built yesterday.

188
00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:36.837
I don't know
why you're playing a prank.

189
00:09:36.837 --> 00:09:39.840
but I know how.

190
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.450
Clearly there are
two identical labs

191
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.887
in this immediate vicinity.

192
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:47.761
You got us.

193
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:49.545
- Ha!
- That's right.

194
00:09:49.545 --> 00:09:51.068
You know what.
can we just have a second?

195
00:09:51.068 --> 00:09:52.809
- Mm-hmm.
- We'll be right back. Okay.

196
00:09:52.809 --> 00:09:54.202
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

197
00:09:56.204 --> 00:09:57.509
Barry.
- Hmm?

198
00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:58.989
What the hell's going on?

199
00:09:58.989 --> 00:10:00.338
And what's up
with the rando antique?

200
00:10:00.338 --> 00:10:02.036
I don't know. I don't know.

201
00:10:02.036 --> 00:10:04.255
I'm trying to call the team.
I can't get a signal.

202
00:10:04.255 --> 00:10:05.909
It's like we're cut off
from the rest of the world.

203
00:10:05.909 --> 00:10:07.781
Okay. first a time loop.
and then Mia and I are

204
00:10:07.781 --> 00:10:09.173
stuck in a dream. and now this?

205
00:10:09.173 --> 00:10:10.784
Maybe it's
some kind of illusion.

206
00:10:10.784 --> 00:10:12.350
I mean. there's at least
a dozen metas that have

207
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:13.787
the ability to create one
this powerful.

208
00:10:13.787 --> 00:10:15.702
Except. I don't know.
this doesn't feel

209
00:10:15.702 --> 00:10:17.138
like an attack or an illusion.

210
00:10:17.138 --> 00:10:18.705
I know.
Okay. but don't worry.

211
00:10:18.705 --> 00:10:20.620
We're gonna find a way out.
It's what we do.

212
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.186
Can we hurry.

213
00:10:22.186 --> 00:10:24.449
because our future speedster
needs a snack.

214
00:10:24.449 --> 00:10:26.147
- That's it?
- What?

215
00:10:26.147 --> 00:10:28.366
That's it. That's it.
I'll run to the future.

216
00:10:28.366 --> 00:10:29.846
I can find out how we escaped.
- No.

217
00:10:29.846 --> 00:10:31.456
And then I can run back
and fix it.

218
00:10:31.456 --> 00:10:32.936
No. Barry. I don't know.
I think we should

219
00:10:32.936 --> 00:10:34.938
think this through
and weigh our options

220
00:10:34.938 --> 00:10:36.287
before you start
zooming through time.

221
00:10:36.287 --> 00:10:37.854
Iris. it's not just about us.

222
00:10:37.854 --> 00:10:39.987
It's about Nora now too.

223
00:10:39.987 --> 00:10:41.728
Whatever's happening
has just started.

224
00:10:41.728 --> 00:10:43.207
but it's gonna escalate fast.

225
00:10:43.207 --> 00:10:44.426
It always does.

226
00:10:44.426 --> 00:10:45.862
That's why my gut is telling me

227
00:10:45.862 --> 00:10:48.952
those people in there are
in real danger.

228
00:10:48.952 --> 00:10:52.826
Isn't yours telling you
the same thing?

229
00:10:52.826 --> 00:10:55.045
Fine.

230
00:10:55.045 --> 00:10:56.873
Just make sure you bring me
back a decent snack

231
00:10:56.873 --> 00:10:58.353
from the future.
- Okay.

232
00:10:58.353 --> 00:11:02.705
Something with pistachios.

233
00:11:02.705 --> 00:11:04.359
♪ You got a Z ♪

234
00:11:04.359 --> 00:11:06.187
♪ We got an A ♪

235
00:11:06.187 --> 00:11:08.798
♪ And what else.
'cause za's not a word ♪

236
00:11:08.798 --> 00:11:11.105
Yeah. it is. Za. like pizza.

237
00:11:11.105 --> 00:11:13.716
Pizza. pizza. pizza!

238
00:11:13.716 --> 00:11:15.849
- Girl. you did not just echo.
- I echoed.

239
00:11:15.849 --> 00:11:17.633
- You are my favorite human.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

240
00:11:17.633 --> 00:11:19.722
But za is not a word.

241
00:11:19.722 --> 00:11:21.463
Why would you say za
instead of pizza?

242
00:11:21.463 --> 00:11:25.336
Pizza just feels good
when you say "pizza."

243
00:11:25.336 --> 00:11:29.036
What's wrong?

244
00:11:29.036 --> 00:11:30.864
You know when I went all nova

245
00:11:30.864 --> 00:11:32.561
at O'Shaughnessy's
a couple weeks ago?

246
00:11:36.347 --> 00:11:38.045
Of course I do.
You were so badass.

247
00:11:38.045 --> 00:11:39.568
Thanks.

248
00:11:39.568 --> 00:11:42.527
Well. now social media
is buzzing

249
00:11:42.527 --> 00:11:44.834
with descriptions
of a new light meta.

250
00:11:44.834 --> 00:11:48.751
descriptions that sound
exactly like me.

251
00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:53.451
Chuck. what if
everyone finds out?

252
00:11:53.451 --> 00:11:58.848
I mean. well. then you'll be
the new celebrity superhero.

253
00:11:58.848 --> 00:12:00.720
I mean. that could be fun.
Think about it.

254
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.548
The mayor would probably invite
you to some fancy parties.

255
00:12:03.548 --> 00:12:05.637
You get to hobnob
with the in crowd.

256
00:12:05.637 --> 00:12:08.249
I don't wanna hobnob
with anyone but you.

257
00:12:08.249 --> 00:12:11.208
I like hobnobbing
with you too.

258
00:12:11.208 --> 00:12:12.993
I mean. hey. look.
let's be real.

259
00:12:12.993 --> 00:12:15.996
You are the most incredible
person I've ever met.

260
00:12:15.996 --> 00:12:19.608
And I have no idea how I got
so lucky as to end up

261
00:12:19.608 --> 00:12:22.219
with someone who's so far
out of my league.

262
00:12:22.219 --> 00:12:23.699
but I'm not even gonna ask
that question

263
00:12:23.699 --> 00:12:25.832
'cause all I know
is that I love you

264
00:12:25.832 --> 00:12:29.270
and you mean the world to... me.

265
00:12:34.231 --> 00:12:38.148
I didn't mean that.

266
00:12:38.148 --> 00:12:39.802
No. I definitely did mean it.
I love you a lot.

267
00:12:39.802 --> 00:12:41.673
And I don't know
why I said it again.

268
00:12:41.673 --> 00:12:43.327
What is wrong with me?
I need to stop talking.

269
00:12:43.327 --> 00:12:45.199
Okay. now you talk.

270
00:12:45.199 --> 00:12:48.898
I--

271
00:12:48.898 --> 00:12:51.161
Oh. hey. guys.

272
00:12:53.381 --> 00:12:54.904
Look at you two lovebirds.

273
00:12:54.904 --> 00:12:56.384
You are just
the cutest thing ever.

274
00:12:56.384 --> 00:12:57.994
Okay. don't mind me.
I am not looking.

275
00:12:57.994 --> 00:12:59.779
I see nothing.
I'm going upstairs.

276
00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:03.304
No. no. no. no. don't.
Stay. Join us.

277
00:13:03.304 --> 00:13:06.655
With three of us. we can play
"Settlers of Catan."

278
00:13:08.396 --> 00:13:10.354
But what about
our "Scrabble" game?

279
00:13:10.354 --> 00:13:11.791
Let's be real.
You were letting me win.

280
00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:13.140
Za's probably not a word.

281
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.358
Do the settlers come
with wine.

282
00:13:14.358 --> 00:13:15.446
'cause I like wine.

283
00:13:15.446 --> 00:13:16.578
- Yes.
- Yay.

284
00:13:16.578 --> 00:13:17.971
Wine. I'll get us wine.

285
00:13:17.971 --> 00:13:19.146
Yay.

286
00:13:21.235 --> 00:13:24.847
Are you guys okay?

287
00:13:24.847 --> 00:13:26.762
- Yes.
- Yeah.

288
00:13:32.724 --> 00:13:34.291
Where's Mr. Allen?

289
00:13:34.291 --> 00:13:35.771
The bathroom.

290
00:13:35.771 --> 00:13:39.296
He's gonna be a while.
Quite a while.

291
00:13:41.168 --> 00:13:44.258
What's that sound?

292
00:13:44.258 --> 00:13:46.129
Uh. I'm starving.

293
00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:48.175
Is anybody else hungry?
I'm buying.

294
00:14:01.579 --> 00:14:04.234
Dude. what was that?

295
00:14:14.114 --> 00:14:16.464
Uh. another prank!

296
00:14:20.163 --> 00:14:21.251
Gotcha.

297
00:14:21.251 --> 00:14:22.818
Okay. I've had enough.

298
00:14:22.818 --> 00:14:25.603
Johnson. you can come out now!

299
00:14:25.603 --> 00:14:26.909
- Who's Johnson?
- Your accomplice.

300
00:14:26.909 --> 00:14:28.476
Johnson from division.

301
00:14:28.476 --> 00:14:29.956
He called ahead. didn't he?
That little...

302
00:14:29.956 --> 00:14:31.174
- Yeah.
- Prankster.

303
00:14:31.174 --> 00:14:32.436
I'm on to you. Johnson!

304
00:14:42.446 --> 00:14:44.971
Okay. this is bad.

305
00:14:44.971 --> 00:14:46.668
- "Star Wars"?
- Oh. I'll say.

306
00:14:46.668 --> 00:14:48.844
You think you're so funny

307
00:14:48.844 --> 00:14:50.498
to mock the guy
who likes sci-fi. huh?

308
00:14:50.498 --> 00:14:52.630
I'll tell you something
that's funny. okay?

309
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:56.460
S.T.A.R. Labs is getting
an F minus

310
00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.245
for how funny you are!

311
00:14:58.245 --> 00:15:00.421
Sir. we have
a larger problem.

312
00:15:14.826 --> 00:15:17.960
Why can't I just go home
and feed my parakeets?

313
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.180
Okay. this is seriously
freaking me out.

314
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.486
Are we in danger?

315
00:15:22.486 --> 00:15:24.793
Um...

316
00:15:24.793 --> 00:15:28.318
Johnson isn't behind this.

317
00:15:28.318 --> 00:15:29.406
Is he?

318
00:15:29.406 --> 00:15:31.495
No. he's not.

319
00:15:31.495 --> 00:15:34.281
How do you know.
and why should we trust you?

320
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.075
Because I'm the Flash.

321
00:15:46.075 --> 00:15:50.210
And whatever's going on here.
it's definitely not good.

322
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.953
Okay. that makes sense.

323
00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:57.173
You know what?

324
00:15:57.173 --> 00:15:59.088
Oh!

325
00:16:07.053 --> 00:16:10.012
Dude. you really are
the Flash.

326
00:16:10.012 --> 00:16:12.493
I've never met
a superhero before.

327
00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.366
I know that we're
in a situation here.

328
00:16:16.366 --> 00:16:19.239
but if we get out of this.
I would love to study

329
00:16:19.239 --> 00:16:21.589
some of your
quantum biochemistry sometime.

330
00:16:21.589 --> 00:16:23.721
If we get out?

331
00:16:23.721 --> 00:16:25.767
No. Are we gonna die?

332
00:16:25.767 --> 00:16:27.812
Oh. man. No.

333
00:16:27.812 --> 00:16:30.032
- Hey. nobody is gonna die.
- No.

334
00:16:30.032 --> 00:16:31.642
No. we just need to figure out

335
00:16:31.642 --> 00:16:35.124
why these objects keep
showing up.

336
00:16:35.124 --> 00:16:37.735
I have a theory about that.

337
00:16:37.735 --> 00:16:42.001
Imagine this is all space-time.

338
00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:46.048
Normally. it flows
and stretches like this.

339
00:16:46.048 --> 00:16:49.791
We move from one room.
one moment to the next.

340
00:16:49.791 --> 00:16:51.401
but we can't do that.

341
00:16:51.401 --> 00:16:53.142
We're stuck.

342
00:16:53.142 --> 00:16:57.190
Because space and time
for us has lost elasticity.

343
00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:59.366
It's like some kind
of gravitational force

344
00:16:59.366 --> 00:17:01.411
is creating a zone
that we can't escape from

345
00:17:01.411 --> 00:17:04.501
and pulling objects
out of time too.

346
00:17:04.501 --> 00:17:07.417
It's called a time magnet.

347
00:17:10.072 --> 00:17:12.683
I really like
science fiction. so...

348
00:17:12.683 --> 00:17:16.383
When I was doing research
for the map book.

349
00:17:16.383 --> 00:17:18.863
I found out
that 100 years from now.

350
00:17:18.863 --> 00:17:20.996
a weapons vault would be
right here.

351
00:17:20.996 --> 00:17:22.563
Let me guess:
one of those weapons

352
00:17:22.563 --> 00:17:24.217
will be a time magnet.

353
00:17:24.217 --> 00:17:26.523
Why is it here now
and not in the future?

354
00:17:26.523 --> 00:17:29.265
Unknown. but in order
to prevent the temporal anomaly

355
00:17:29.265 --> 00:17:30.875
that we're stuck in
from happening.

356
00:17:30.875 --> 00:17:32.964
this future weapons vault
would have paired

357
00:17:32.964 --> 00:17:35.141
the time magnet
with some kind of stabilizer.

358
00:17:35.141 --> 00:17:37.621
So whoever brought
the magnet with them

359
00:17:37.621 --> 00:17:40.885
from the past forgot to bring
the stabilizer with them?

360
00:17:43.149 --> 00:17:45.020
Maybe they were in a hurry.

361
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:48.850
Why would they be in a hurry?

362
00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.939
Because they were
stealing it.

363
00:17:50.939 --> 00:17:52.723
Think about it.
it could be a thief.

364
00:17:52.723 --> 00:17:56.205
a time thief trying to escape
their past to get away.

365
00:17:56.205 --> 00:17:57.685
Now hold on.

366
00:17:57.685 --> 00:17:59.208
We haven't seen
anybody come through here

367
00:17:59.208 --> 00:18:01.297
except for the people
in this room.

368
00:18:01.297 --> 00:18:04.344
You're right.

369
00:18:04.344 --> 00:18:09.740
So that means that somebody
in this room is a...

370
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.828
thief.

371
00:18:17.139 --> 00:18:19.185
Let's not jump
to conclusions.

372
00:18:19.185 --> 00:18:20.838
Jane. is there any way
to find out

373
00:18:20.838 --> 00:18:22.492
if someone is from
a different time?

374
00:18:22.492 --> 00:18:24.233
Theoretically.
a time traveler might

375
00:18:24.233 --> 00:18:26.627
give off excess radiation.

376
00:18:26.627 --> 00:18:28.803
and we have
a radiation scanner.

377
00:18:28.803 --> 00:18:30.761
Okay.

378
00:18:30.761 --> 00:18:34.504
Well. let's test that theory.

379
00:18:44.862 --> 00:18:46.821
Well. I guess I can't go.

380
00:18:46.821 --> 00:18:48.997
which means it's your turn. Allegra.

381
00:18:48.997 --> 00:18:50.781
and by the looks of it.
you have

382
00:18:50.781 --> 00:18:55.046
enough lumber and brick
to build two roads.

383
00:18:55.046 --> 00:18:58.485
Which means you have
the longest road.

384
00:19:00.051 --> 00:19:02.228
Which means I win. I think.

385
00:19:02.228 --> 00:19:03.925
- Mm.
- Oh! Yay.

386
00:19:03.925 --> 00:19:06.406
You know.
the thing about roads is.

387
00:19:06.406 --> 00:19:08.756
when you go down a road.
you can always come back.

388
00:19:08.756 --> 00:19:10.192
You just turn around

389
00:19:10.192 --> 00:19:13.848
and go back
to where you started...

390
00:19:13.848 --> 00:19:16.067
or where we started.

391
00:19:19.723 --> 00:19:21.334
You know.
I have some legal briefs

392
00:19:21.334 --> 00:19:22.726
upstairs that I need
to work on.

393
00:19:22.726 --> 00:19:23.901
so I'm just gonna
mosey on upstairs--

394
00:19:23.901 --> 00:19:25.207
No. don't.

395
00:19:25.207 --> 00:19:26.774
Best two out of three.

396
00:19:26.774 --> 00:19:29.037
Right?

397
00:19:29.037 --> 00:19:31.039
It's okay. Allegra.

398
00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:33.955
I'll just--I'll just go.

399
00:19:40.962 --> 00:19:42.703
Okay.
now that Chester's gone.

400
00:19:42.703 --> 00:19:44.748
you wanna tell me
what happened?

401
00:19:46.924 --> 00:19:49.884
]

402
00:19:56.499 --> 00:19:59.633
Hmm.

403
00:19:59.633 --> 00:20:01.156
Clear.

404
00:20:04.899 --> 00:20:07.249
You seem to know
a lot about this. Jane.

405
00:20:07.249 --> 00:20:09.120
Maybe you're the time thief.

406
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.731
I am the only one
in this room

407
00:20:10.731 --> 00:20:13.995
with the mathematical expertise.

408
00:20:13.995 --> 00:20:17.520
I suppose it is possible
that time travel induces

409
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.480
temporary amnesia
such that I could be

410
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.395
the time thief
without remembering.

411
00:20:34.102 --> 00:20:36.626
You're clear too. Jane.

412
00:20:52.729 --> 00:20:54.209
Clear.

413
00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:58.909
Wow.

414
00:20:58.909 --> 00:21:01.521
Look. I'm not
some kind of time traveler.

415
00:21:01.521 --> 00:21:03.784
This is a ruse.

416
00:21:03.784 --> 00:21:06.613
a distraction to cover
for your broken facility!

417
00:21:06.613 --> 00:21:08.136
And when I get out of here.
I am report--

418
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:11.748
What is it?

419
00:21:11.748 --> 00:21:14.229
Howard. what is it?

420
00:21:26.067 --> 00:21:28.199
Oh. God.

421
00:21:28.199 --> 00:21:31.115
He's a statue.

422
00:21:31.115 --> 00:21:32.856
We're all gonna be statues.

423
00:21:32.856 --> 00:21:34.815
He's not a statue.

424
00:21:34.815 --> 00:21:36.643
He's dead.
- De--

425
00:21:36.643 --> 00:21:38.514
Scattered through time
and space in a collection

426
00:21:38.514 --> 00:21:40.516
of free-floating
subatomic particles.

427
00:21:40.516 --> 00:21:43.954
So he was erased
and replaced with a statue?

428
00:21:43.954 --> 00:21:47.088
It's the law
of conservation of matter.

429
00:21:47.088 --> 00:21:51.005
If we don't all get out
of here soon. we're next.

430
00:21:57.272 --> 00:21:58.404
Okay. I'm freaking out. man.

431
00:21:58.404 --> 00:22:00.493
This is--this is way too heavy.

432
00:22:00.493 --> 00:22:01.885
Everybody stay calm.

433
00:22:01.885 --> 00:22:03.626
Flash. you gotta save us.

434
00:22:03.626 --> 00:22:05.672
I don't wanna become a creepy
nude dude made of stone.

435
00:22:05.672 --> 00:22:07.151
Poor Chief Howard.

436
00:22:07.151 --> 00:22:09.980
What could have caused that
to happen?

437
00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.156
She did it.

438
00:22:12.156 --> 00:22:13.332
Mrs. Flash?

439
00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:14.811
Seriously?
- Me?

440
00:22:14.811 --> 00:22:16.204
I didn't even get
a chance to scan him.

441
00:22:16.204 --> 00:22:17.988
Why should we believe you?

442
00:22:17.988 --> 00:22:19.773
Maybe the scanner did something
you're not aware of.

443
00:22:19.773 --> 00:22:21.470
She's right.

444
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.298
I need to run
through some more equations.

445
00:22:23.298 --> 00:22:24.908
I think better when I'm running
through the variables.

446
00:22:24.908 --> 00:22:27.258
- Be my guest.
- Why did I come to work today?

447
00:22:27.258 --> 00:22:29.957
I could have stayed home.
watched some cartoons.

448
00:22:29.957 --> 00:22:32.263
Look. we both know
you didn't cause

449
00:22:32.263 --> 00:22:34.004
whatever happened to Howard.
which means it has to be

450
00:22:34.004 --> 00:22:35.876
something else.
something we haven't seen yet.

451
00:22:35.876 --> 00:22:37.660
Okay. well. we need to figure
out what that is and fast.

452
00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.532
Otherwise--
- I know.

453
00:22:39.532 --> 00:22:42.491
Bad taste in clothing will be
the least of our concerns.

454
00:22:45.538 --> 00:22:49.106
Okay. I'm all ears.

455
00:22:49.106 --> 00:22:51.108
Chester told me he loves me.

456
00:22:51.108 --> 00:22:53.676
What? I knew it!

457
00:22:53.676 --> 00:22:55.548
You guys have been making
the "I'm about to say it" eyes

458
00:22:55.548 --> 00:22:59.595
at each other for so long.
and you finally did it.

459
00:22:59.595 --> 00:23:01.162
Am I confused?

460
00:23:01.162 --> 00:23:03.294
Do you not feel
the same way about him?

461
00:23:03.294 --> 00:23:05.035
I love him so much it hurts.

462
00:23:05.035 --> 00:23:07.255
Aww! Then what's the problem?

463
00:23:07.255 --> 00:23:08.735
He loves you. You love him.

464
00:23:08.735 --> 00:23:11.825
Just say it back
and get to the good stuff.

465
00:23:11.825 --> 00:23:17.352
Cecile. you know what happens
to people that I love.

466
00:23:17.352 --> 00:23:21.878
They leave or worse.
like Nash and Esperanza.

467
00:23:35.414 --> 00:23:38.591
Allegra. I can't even imagine
how tough that was

468
00:23:38.591 --> 00:23:42.595
for you to go through.
but Chester.

469
00:23:42.595 --> 00:23:46.860
if he loves you.
he's not gonna leave.

470
00:23:48.339 --> 00:23:49.863
It's the same thing
my dad said

471
00:23:49.863 --> 00:23:52.300
right before he bailed
on me and my mom.

472
00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.823
and she said it too.

473
00:23:53.823 --> 00:23:55.999
right before she kicked me
out of the house.

474
00:23:55.999 --> 00:23:57.697
I'm sorry.

475
00:23:57.697 --> 00:24:01.570
I don't want to care
for someone like that

476
00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:04.530
and then have them leave.
not again.

477
00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:06.706
I don't think
I could handle it.

478
00:24:06.706 --> 00:24:08.621
I understand.

479
00:24:08.621 --> 00:24:10.971
- Really?
- Yeah. really.

480
00:24:10.971 --> 00:24:12.755
One failed marriage over here.

481
00:24:12.755 --> 00:24:15.105
thank you very much.

482
00:24:15.105 --> 00:24:17.020
You never talk about it.

483
00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:20.284
Because it sucked.

484
00:24:20.284 --> 00:24:24.158
But. Allegra. you are not
gonna lose Chester.

485
00:24:24.158 --> 00:24:27.074
and besides.
God forbid you guys break up.

486
00:24:27.074 --> 00:24:30.120
that's. like.
way in the future.

487
00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.035
See? It could happen.

488
00:24:32.035 --> 00:24:35.604
It could happen.
You could also get married.

489
00:24:35.604 --> 00:24:38.477
Don't freak out!

490
00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:40.957
My point is.

491
00:24:40.957 --> 00:24:44.570
right now. in this moment.

492
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.049
you are falling in love.

493
00:24:46.049 --> 00:24:47.398
Everything that
you're worried about.

494
00:24:47.398 --> 00:24:50.358
that's way off in the future.

495
00:24:50.358 --> 00:24:54.667
This moment is magical.

496
00:24:54.667 --> 00:24:59.323
so why don't you just be in it?

497
00:24:59.323 --> 00:25:02.849
Give it everything you've got
and enjoy every second of it.

498
00:25:02.849 --> 00:25:05.939
because if there's one thing
that I know.

499
00:25:05.939 --> 00:25:07.854
it's that
what you and Chester have.

500
00:25:07.854 --> 00:25:11.814
it is something special.

501
00:25:15.992 --> 00:25:17.907
I don't get it.

502
00:25:17.907 --> 00:25:19.692
There's no pattern
to anything that's happening.

503
00:25:19.692 --> 00:25:21.389
Except for the fact
that we're about to be

504
00:25:21.389 --> 00:25:23.434
erased from time along with
two more innocent lives.

505
00:25:23.434 --> 00:25:25.567
Oh. my God.

506
00:25:25.567 --> 00:25:27.569
I'm sorry.

507
00:25:27.569 --> 00:25:29.702
I never should have tried
to open the Speed Force tunnel.

508
00:25:29.702 --> 00:25:31.660
No. Barry. I'm sorry.

509
00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:33.401
My thief detection plan got

510
00:25:33.401 --> 00:25:35.446
Chief Inspector Howard atomized.

511
00:25:35.446 --> 00:25:39.015
Iris. running to the future.
again. when it never works--

512
00:25:39.015 --> 00:25:42.105
I should know that by now.
but it doesn't stop me

513
00:25:42.105 --> 00:25:47.241
from building a crib
seven months in advance.

514
00:25:52.333 --> 00:25:54.727
Well. it's not like
I'm any better.

515
00:25:54.727 --> 00:25:56.990
Barry. I think I'm in denial

516
00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:00.776
about how different
things are becoming.

517
00:26:00.776 --> 00:26:03.736
and... I don't know.

518
00:26:03.736 --> 00:26:05.346
I think I'm worried
that I'm not gonna be able

519
00:26:05.346 --> 00:26:08.567
to do the things
that I used to.

520
00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:12.527
Iris. just 'cause you might
have to slow down a bit

521
00:26:12.527 --> 00:26:14.355
for your pregnancy.
it doesn't mean

522
00:26:14.355 --> 00:26:16.575
you're never gonna get to do
the things you love again.

523
00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:19.229
Yeah. I know. but. Barry.
it's like

524
00:26:19.229 --> 00:26:23.973
everything is changing.
and I can't stop it.

525
00:26:23.973 --> 00:26:27.150
Like my body.

526
00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:30.545
Barry. I can feel it changing.

527
00:26:30.545 --> 00:26:32.808
And I'm tired
all the time now too.

528
00:26:32.808 --> 00:26:35.158
and I just wanna eat
everything in sight

529
00:26:35.158 --> 00:26:37.944
and I have a pregnancy brain.
and it's like where you just--

530
00:26:37.944 --> 00:26:39.728
you talk about things
that you said.

531
00:26:39.728 --> 00:26:41.251
and then the next second
you don't even remember

532
00:26:41.251 --> 00:26:42.949
what you've said.

533
00:26:42.949 --> 00:26:44.690
I'm sorry.

534
00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:47.867
I can only imagine
how tough it is.

535
00:26:47.867 --> 00:26:49.259
Baby. I don't want you
to think

536
00:26:49.259 --> 00:26:50.696
that I regret getting pregnant.

537
00:26:50.696 --> 00:26:52.785
It's just...

538
00:26:52.785 --> 00:26:55.222
sometimes I wish I could
go back to my old self.

539
00:27:01.663 --> 00:27:04.187
What?

540
00:27:04.187 --> 00:27:05.798
It's like
I'm stuck in the past.

541
00:27:05.798 --> 00:27:07.669
and you're racing
to the future.

542
00:27:09.976 --> 00:27:12.456
And now I just want
some cookie dough ice cream.

543
00:27:12.456 --> 00:27:14.545
I think you mean
vanilla bean.

544
00:27:14.545 --> 00:27:17.287
Yeah. See? Pregnancy brain.

545
00:27:17.287 --> 00:27:19.072
It's okay.

546
00:27:19.072 --> 00:27:20.769
I'm sorry.

547
00:27:25.992 --> 00:27:27.341
You're not the only one

548
00:27:27.341 --> 00:27:30.605
that's been getting things
mixed up.

549
00:27:30.605 --> 00:27:33.739
What does that mean?

550
00:27:33.739 --> 00:27:36.437
I know who our time thief is.

551
00:27:42.878 --> 00:27:46.403
Okay. look. we're really
sorry that this is happening.

552
00:27:46.403 --> 00:27:50.930
but we both promise you that
we will get you out of here.

553
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:52.627
Thanks. Mrs. Flash.

554
00:27:52.627 --> 00:27:54.194
So. look.
Iris and I discussed it.

555
00:27:54.194 --> 00:27:55.761
and we think we know

556
00:27:55.761 --> 00:27:57.458
what might be
causing all this to happen.

557
00:27:57.458 --> 00:27:59.199
Really?

558
00:27:59.199 --> 00:28:01.636
Yeah. the Speed Lab is
where I carry out experiments

559
00:28:01.636 --> 00:28:05.118
as the Flash. so it's possible
this room is flooded

560
00:28:05.118 --> 00:28:06.815
with temporal particles.

561
00:28:06.815 --> 00:28:08.730
What does that
have to do with anything?

562
00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:10.601
I'm glad you asked that.

563
00:28:10.601 --> 00:28:13.082
Temporal particles can
become volatile

564
00:28:13.082 --> 00:28:14.997
when exposed
to electrical fields.

565
00:28:14.997 --> 00:28:17.217
- They can?
- Yes.

566
00:28:17.217 --> 00:28:19.132
And since we haven't had
this facility

567
00:28:19.132 --> 00:28:21.003
inspected in nine years.

568
00:28:21.003 --> 00:28:23.049
the wiring
throughout S.T.A.R. Labs

569
00:28:23.049 --> 00:28:26.748
is probably faulty.
including the check valves.

570
00:28:29.185 --> 00:28:32.580
We're glad that you're here.
Inspector Tao.

571
00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:36.062
Could you check those
for us. please?

572
00:28:36.062 --> 00:28:37.933
Yeah. those valves
could be reacting

573
00:28:37.933 --> 00:28:41.241
with random electrical fields.
causing time anomalies.

574
00:28:41.241 --> 00:28:42.851
- Makes sense to me.
- Hold on a minute--

575
00:28:42.851 --> 00:28:46.550
Inspector.
where do you wanna start?

576
00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:49.684
Well. first.
I'll check the wires.

577
00:28:49.684 --> 00:28:52.731
Which ones?

578
00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:57.170
The... red ones.

579
00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.999
Then I'll...

580
00:28:59.999 --> 00:29:02.001
Call a plumber.

581
00:29:02.001 --> 00:29:06.962
since check valves guide
water flow. not electricity.

582
00:29:06.962 --> 00:29:08.964
Which you would know
if you were

583
00:29:08.964 --> 00:29:12.098
a real electrical inspector.

584
00:29:12.098 --> 00:29:15.666
You're the time thief.

585
00:29:15.666 --> 00:29:17.233
Prove it.

586
00:29:17.233 --> 00:29:19.148
You didn't know
what a breaker box was.

587
00:29:19.148 --> 00:29:22.891
So your thing with
the electrical stuff in it?

588
00:29:22.891 --> 00:29:24.719
Uh. the breaker box?

589
00:29:24.719 --> 00:29:27.069
Right. um. the breaker box.

590
00:29:51.137 --> 00:29:52.834
- No. no. wait!
- Uh-uh.

591
00:29:52.834 --> 00:29:54.749
We're running out
of time. Flash.

592
00:29:54.749 --> 00:29:57.099
Now help me get
the hell out of here.

593
00:29:57.099 --> 00:29:58.971
or Mrs. Flash gets it next.

594
00:30:10.721 --> 00:30:12.027
Who are you?

595
00:30:12.027 --> 00:30:15.422
Lady Chronos.

596
00:30:15.422 --> 00:30:18.033
The greatest thief
time has ever known.

597
00:30:18.033 --> 00:30:19.382
You know what's happening.
don't you?

598
00:30:19.382 --> 00:30:21.254
We're being erased by time

599
00:30:21.254 --> 00:30:24.300
because of this.

600
00:30:28.696 --> 00:30:30.176
Nice try.

601
00:30:30.176 --> 00:30:32.047
This time magnet has
an identity matrix.

602
00:30:32.047 --> 00:30:35.007
which I reset to my biometrics.

603
00:30:35.007 --> 00:30:38.314
Anyone tries to take it
from me. they go boom.

604
00:30:38.314 --> 00:30:39.838
Yeah.

605
00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:42.797
Now get me out of here
before we all die.

606
00:30:42.797 --> 00:30:45.060
Why don't you just get rid
of the time magnet?

607
00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:46.409
Uh-uh.

608
00:30:46.409 --> 00:30:48.542
This baby is
my retirement score.

609
00:30:48.542 --> 00:30:53.895
With it. I can just relax
on the beach in the Caribbean.

610
00:30:53.895 --> 00:30:56.593
Then when I decide I wanna
steal the Mona Lisa.

611
00:30:56.593 --> 00:31:00.075
all I have to do
is activate this.

612
00:31:00.075 --> 00:31:03.122
and the magnet will
bring it to me instantly.

613
00:31:03.122 --> 00:31:04.601
If you just wanna leave.

614
00:31:04.601 --> 00:31:06.255
why'd you kill Howard
and the others?

615
00:31:06.255 --> 00:31:08.518
I didn't.

616
00:31:08.518 --> 00:31:10.738
The time magnet did.

617
00:31:10.738 --> 00:31:13.175
When I helped Howard up earlier
and he handed me his hat.

618
00:31:13.175 --> 00:31:15.482
<i>he unknowingly brushed
against the magnet</i>

619
00:31:15.482 --> 00:31:17.614
while it was cloaked.

620
00:31:17.614 --> 00:31:20.835
Then 20 minutes later. poof.

621
00:31:20.835 --> 00:31:22.968
You see. the time magnet
is attracting

622
00:31:22.968 --> 00:31:25.274
temporal displacement
particles--

623
00:31:25.274 --> 00:31:27.102
Causing everything
to transmogrify.

624
00:31:27.102 --> 00:31:28.408
Yup.

625
00:31:28.408 --> 00:31:30.018
That's why
when Howard disappeared.

626
00:31:30.018 --> 00:31:34.414
I knew I could use
the magnet as a weapon.

627
00:31:34.414 --> 00:31:36.459
So what's your plan
to get me out of here?

628
00:31:36.459 --> 00:31:38.418
I already tried
to use my speed.

629
00:31:38.418 --> 00:31:41.377
I can't even get myself out.
let alone someone else.

630
00:31:41.377 --> 00:31:43.510
Why don't you just tell us
how you got stuck here

631
00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:44.815
in the first place.
and maybe we can find

632
00:31:44.815 --> 00:31:46.165
a way out of here together?

633
00:31:46.165 --> 00:31:48.167
You probably know
this lab becomes

634
00:31:48.167 --> 00:31:51.039
a Flash museum in the future.

635
00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:53.999
<i>It's defenses
are impenetrable.</i>

636
00:31:53.999 --> 00:31:56.871
<i>But I almost beat them</i>

637
00:31:56.871 --> 00:31:59.482
<i>before security boxed me in.</i>

638
00:31:59.482 --> 00:32:01.484
<i>Then I noticed the lab's
last major inspection</i>

639
00:32:01.484 --> 00:32:06.576
<i>before becoming a museum was
dated today. April 5. 2023.</i>

640
00:32:06.576 --> 00:32:09.318
<i>Fortunately. my chrono-belt
allows me to jump through time</i>

641
00:32:09.318 --> 00:32:10.798
<i>to a single location.</i>

642
00:32:14.062 --> 00:32:16.891
<i>So I used it to travel
back here to the past.</i>

643
00:32:18.197 --> 00:32:21.200
<i>Then all I had to do
was sneak in here</i>

644
00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.202
<i>posing as an inspector.</i>

645
00:32:23.202 --> 00:32:26.901
Let's go. folks.

646
00:32:26.901 --> 00:32:29.121
<i>Then I simply traveled back
to 2123.</i>

647
00:32:29.121 --> 00:32:32.776
<i>only this time appearing
inside the weapons vault.</i>

648
00:32:32.776 --> 00:32:34.865
<i>Then I snatched
the time magnet</i>

649
00:32:34.865 --> 00:32:36.345
<i>and came back here
before anyone could</i>

650
00:32:36.345 --> 00:32:38.086
<i>notice I was gone.</i>

651
00:32:38.086 --> 00:32:41.046
<i>After that. I just had
to walk out of here.</i>

652
00:32:41.046 --> 00:32:43.135
<i>but I couldn't.</i>

653
00:32:43.135 --> 00:32:45.137
<i>You were right. Flash.</i>

654
00:32:45.137 --> 00:32:47.139
<i>The magnet's so powerful.
it's attracting objects</i>

655
00:32:47.139 --> 00:32:48.749
<i>throughout time.</i>

656
00:32:48.749 --> 00:32:51.143
<i>trapping us here
in the process.</i>

657
00:32:51.143 --> 00:32:53.884
So what's the solution. speedy?

658
00:32:53.884 --> 00:32:56.322
If your chrono-belt can
transport you through time.

659
00:32:56.322 --> 00:32:58.846
why not just go to 2123.
put the magnet back?

660
00:32:58.846 --> 00:33:00.500
I can't.

661
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.415
My belt lost its charge
after I liberated--

662
00:33:02.415 --> 00:33:04.417
- Stole.
- Permanently borrowed

663
00:33:04.417 --> 00:33:06.985
the time magnet.

664
00:33:06.985 --> 00:33:08.769
The magnet must have
affected it too.

665
00:33:08.769 --> 00:33:10.423
Then let's destroy
the magnet.

666
00:33:10.423 --> 00:33:13.208
Do that and we all get
reduced to subatomic sludge.

667
00:33:13.208 --> 00:33:15.080
If we can't destroy it.
then we need to rejoin

668
00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.082
the time magnet
with its stabilizing agent.

669
00:33:17.082 --> 00:33:19.345
Uh-uh. like I said.
parting with my retirement fund

670
00:33:19.345 --> 00:33:20.955
is not an option.

671
00:33:20.955 --> 00:33:22.522
How long do we have
before we all get erased?

672
00:33:22.522 --> 00:33:26.004
I don't know.
but it's gotta be soon.

673
00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:27.875
Unless you have
a rapid rate kinetic generator

674
00:33:27.875 --> 00:33:31.661
hiding somewhere in here.
I can't recharge my belt.

675
00:33:38.538 --> 00:33:40.018
We've got me.

676
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:46.154
If you wanna survive.
I'm your only choice.

677
00:33:55.337 --> 00:33:58.253
Working with the Flash.

678
00:33:58.253 --> 00:34:00.125
I can't believe this.

679
00:34:16.271 --> 00:34:19.013
Wait.

680
00:34:19.013 --> 00:34:21.624
How do we know
that we can trust you?

681
00:34:21.624 --> 00:34:24.192
I've had the most direct
contact with the magnet.

682
00:34:24.192 --> 00:34:27.195
so my mask can't
protect me much longer.

683
00:34:27.195 --> 00:34:30.285
If I don't restabilize
this thing.

684
00:34:30.285 --> 00:34:32.461
I'll be the first to go.

685
00:34:59.445 --> 00:35:03.579
The second I return this.
I'll be arrested.

686
00:35:03.579 --> 00:35:05.407
At least you'll be alive.

687
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:21.684
How will we know putting
the time magnet back worked?

688
00:35:34.523 --> 00:35:36.308
She did it.

689
00:35:37.831 --> 00:35:39.441
Time's reset itself.

690
00:35:39.441 --> 00:35:41.182
What about Howard
and the others?

691
00:35:41.182 --> 00:35:44.620
We're right behind you.

692
00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:46.970
Inspector Howard.

693
00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:48.102
You're okay?

694
00:35:48.102 --> 00:35:50.496
No.

695
00:35:50.496 --> 00:35:54.152
Ah. he will be
once the inspection's done.

696
00:35:54.152 --> 00:35:55.762
Exactly.

697
00:36:02.377 --> 00:36:07.600
So first thing. why do you
call this room the Speed Lab?

698
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.777
Why do we call this room
the Speed Lab?

699
00:36:10.777 --> 00:36:13.475
We just really love
the Flash.

700
00:36:13.475 --> 00:36:16.435
Yes.

701
00:36:16.435 --> 00:36:18.567
Yup. he is a really...

702
00:36:18.567 --> 00:36:21.962
- Handsome.
- Nice. handsome guy.

703
00:36:21.962 --> 00:36:23.398
Wouldn't know.

704
00:36:23.398 --> 00:36:25.183
Never met him.

705
00:36:25.183 --> 00:36:26.619
Well...

706
00:36:26.619 --> 00:36:30.579
Okay. people.
you know the drill.

707
00:36:30.579 --> 00:36:32.233
All right. people.

708
00:36:32.233 --> 00:36:34.540
Let's get started.

709
00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:37.891
- Handsome?
- I mean. yeah.

710
00:36:41.764 --> 00:36:43.462
And so you guys have been
stuck in the Speed Lab all day?

711
00:36:43.462 --> 00:36:46.465
Yeah. until the timeline
reset itself

712
00:36:46.465 --> 00:36:48.945
and Howard and all the other
inspectors walked in

713
00:36:48.945 --> 00:36:50.817
like nothing had happened.

714
00:36:50.817 --> 00:36:52.253
And they didn't
remember a thing?

715
00:36:52.253 --> 00:36:54.821
No. they just went back
to their jobs.

716
00:36:54.821 --> 00:36:58.390
So now S.T.A.R. Labs is
officially mold-free.

717
00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:00.914
And one of the safest nuclear
facilities in the world.

718
00:37:00.914 --> 00:37:02.002
Although
I could have told you

719
00:37:02.002 --> 00:37:04.134
you don't have a mold problem.

720
00:37:04.134 --> 00:37:05.440
How?

721
00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.616
I don't know. I just can.

722
00:37:07.616 --> 00:37:11.141
Well. we're just glad
we passed the inspection

723
00:37:11.141 --> 00:37:12.317
after everything
that's happened here

724
00:37:12.317 --> 00:37:14.101
in the last nine years.

725
00:37:29.159 --> 00:37:31.640
Let's just say
we were a little concerned.

726
00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.729
- Yeah.
- And what about Lady Chronos?

727
00:37:33.729 --> 00:37:35.296
Any chance she got away?

728
00:37:35.296 --> 00:37:38.560
Guess we'll find out
in 100 years.

729
00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.867
Hey. how did it go
with you and Carla?

730
00:37:40.867 --> 00:37:42.608
Turns out
she does not want me

731
00:37:42.608 --> 00:37:45.045
to replace her daughters
Caitlin or Frost.

732
00:37:45.045 --> 00:37:47.613
She just wanted
to get to know me as a friend.

733
00:37:47.613 --> 00:37:49.876
and she seems very wise.

734
00:37:49.876 --> 00:37:52.835
You know. as someone who's only
about eight weeks old.

735
00:37:52.835 --> 00:37:56.883
I really could use
a strong female mentor...

736
00:37:56.883 --> 00:37:58.363
and dinner.

737
00:37:58.363 --> 00:38:02.323
Iris. I know you're starving.

738
00:38:02.323 --> 00:38:04.891
How do you--
actually. you know what?

739
00:38:04.891 --> 00:38:06.588
It's already super freaky.
Never mind.

740
00:38:06.588 --> 00:38:09.635
How about we get
dinner for three at Helena's?

741
00:38:09.635 --> 00:38:10.897
- Cheese fries?
- Yeah.

742
00:38:10.897 --> 00:38:12.420
Yes. please.

743
00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:14.335
Sounds amazing.

744
00:38:14.335 --> 00:38:15.989
Do I like cheese fries?

745
00:38:15.989 --> 00:38:18.121
I don't know.
We'll find out.

746
00:38:23.779 --> 00:38:25.477
Hey. Chuck.

747
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:29.307
Oh. you can't even look at me.

748
00:38:29.307 --> 00:38:31.918
I guess I deserve that.

749
00:38:31.918 --> 00:38:36.270
But I have something
I have to tell you.

750
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:37.576
Just don't.

751
00:38:37.576 --> 00:38:41.797
I know I messed up. okay?
Big time.

752
00:38:41.797 --> 00:38:46.019
What I said to you earlier.
I was way out of line.

753
00:38:46.019 --> 00:38:47.629
and it was so not fair to you.

754
00:38:47.629 --> 00:38:48.674
Chuck--

755
00:38:48.674 --> 00:38:50.502
I moved way too fast.

756
00:38:50.502 --> 00:38:51.938
and I get why you freaked out.

757
00:38:51.938 --> 00:38:53.722
Anybody would.
- Chuck--

758
00:38:53.722 --> 00:38:56.551
So now you wanna call
the whole thing off. which I--

759
00:38:56.551 --> 00:38:58.945
Chuck. you didn't
mess this up.

760
00:38:58.945 --> 00:39:00.512
I did.

761
00:39:00.512 --> 00:39:03.123
I've been in a lot
of bad relationships.

762
00:39:03.123 --> 00:39:05.778
so it's hard

763
00:39:05.778 --> 00:39:10.043
for me to accept a good one
when it comes along.

764
00:39:10.043 --> 00:39:14.613
Well. not good. Great.

765
00:39:16.136 --> 00:39:18.530
"Great relationship"
as in us?

766
00:39:25.188 --> 00:39:29.018
When you said "I love you."
the first thing I thought was.

767
00:39:29.018 --> 00:39:32.544
"What if this doesn't work out
or what if I screw it up

768
00:39:32.544 --> 00:39:36.330
and I lose him."
but that's my baggage.

769
00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:38.201
not yours.

770
00:39:38.201 --> 00:39:41.291
You were worried
about losing me?

771
00:39:41.291 --> 00:39:43.816
Chuck. you're one
of the best things

772
00:39:43.816 --> 00:39:45.818
that's ever happened to me.

773
00:39:45.818 --> 00:39:49.604
and I don't wanna
push you away.

774
00:39:49.604 --> 00:39:53.434
So I guess what I'm trying
to say is...

775
00:39:55.393 --> 00:39:59.005
I love you too.

776
00:39:59.005 --> 00:40:01.268
You do?

777
00:40:01.268 --> 00:40:03.531
Yeah. I just--
I hope I'm not too late.

778
00:40:03.531 --> 00:40:05.577
No.

779
00:40:05.577 --> 00:40:07.579
No. no. definitely not.

780
00:40:14.324 --> 00:40:16.109
Do you wanna go
back to my place?

781
00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:17.632
I do.

782
00:40:17.632 --> 00:40:20.461
I--I definitely do.
but you should know

783
00:40:20.461 --> 00:40:24.900
that I was very sad.
and so I drank.

784
00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:28.469
like. seven Vibe-accinos.
you know.

785
00:40:28.469 --> 00:40:32.081
which means I'll probably be
wide awake for the next.

786
00:40:32.081 --> 00:40:35.781
you know. 10 to 12 hours.
give or take.

787
00:40:35.781 --> 00:40:40.742
Well. good thing we know how
to work off all that energy.

788
00:40:42.831 --> 00:40:45.791
Sorry about that.
Yeah. sounds great.

789
00:41:02.677 --> 00:41:04.940
How could I still be
hungry for dessert?

790
00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:06.942
Do you need help?
I could help you out.

791
00:41:06.942 --> 00:41:08.770
Get your own. pal.

792
00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:10.337
I will.

793
00:41:13.471 --> 00:41:14.994
Just so you know. you now have

794
00:41:14.994 --> 00:41:18.867
a freezer full
of your favorite ice cream.

795
00:41:18.867 --> 00:41:21.304
- Best husband ever.
- Yeah.

796
00:41:21.304 --> 00:41:23.393
Thanks. boo.

797
00:41:23.393 --> 00:41:25.831
So when do you think
Nora develops

798
00:41:25.831 --> 00:41:27.180
her cookie dough craving?

799
00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.530
No idea.
But I think I'll wait.

800
00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:32.577
Let her tell us
when she gets here.

801
00:41:32.577 --> 00:41:35.580
Till then.
let's just spend each day

802
00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:38.234
doing what we want to do
in the moment.

803
00:41:38.234 --> 00:41:40.236
To vanilla bean.

804
00:41:40.236 --> 00:41:43.022
And our little bean.
'cause when she gets here.

805
00:41:43.022 --> 00:41:45.807
we're gonna be
on her timetable for...

806
00:41:45.807 --> 00:41:48.288
Ever.

807
00:41:48.288 --> 00:41:50.029
Forever.

808
00:41:50.029 --> 00:41:51.639
Sounds good to me.

809
00:41:51.639 --> 00:41:53.772
Me too.

810
00:42:16.098 --> 00:42:17.447
