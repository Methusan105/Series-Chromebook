1
00:00:09.792 --> 00:00:11.837
Gabba gabba hey!

2
00:00:11.837 --> 00:00:13.709
Yeah. I know.

3
00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.058
Very well done.

4
00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.542
Target secured.

5
00:00:20.542 --> 00:00:22.500
Now. where's our--
where's our getaway?

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.285
Freeze!

7
00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:26.591
Drop the weapon.

8
00:00:26.591 --> 00:00:30.421
Two against one.
Guy's got a death wish.

9
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:32.336
Yeah. either that
or he's an idiot.

10
00:00:32.336 --> 00:00:35.426
Either way.
I'm gonna enjoy this.

11
00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:48.831
Thank you. Amar.

12
00:01:23.518 --> 00:01:24.910
Hmm?

13
00:01:36.444 --> 00:01:37.575
Hmm?

14
00:01:40.143 --> 00:01:41.492
Ah.
- Ah.

15
00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:04.385
Mm.

16
00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:09.477
Think she could tell
we tried that recipe

17
00:02:09.477 --> 00:02:11.392
40 times in Flashtime?

18
00:02:11.392 --> 00:02:13.568
- No.
- Yeah. yeah.

19
00:02:13.568 --> 00:02:16.136
So another great babymoon
adventure in the books.

20
00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:18.703
Yeah. tomorrow. we do
that sunset cruise off Kauai.

21
00:02:18.703 --> 00:02:20.618
and then Cabo
for a mezcal nightcap.

22
00:02:20.618 --> 00:02:22.881
At this rate. we are definitely
gonna finish the list

23
00:02:22.881 --> 00:02:24.231
before you're pregnant.

24
00:02:24.231 --> 00:02:27.103
That's great.

25
00:02:27.103 --> 00:02:28.757
CCPD Alert.

26
00:02:28.757 --> 00:02:30.976
There was a break-in
at Corbin Taft Industries.

27
00:02:30.976 --> 00:02:32.717
Do you want me
to drop you off at home?

28
00:02:32.717 --> 00:02:34.676
No. no. no. I'll go with.
I mean. Aariz could use

29
00:02:34.676 --> 00:02:36.417
a day off
from the lab break-in beat.

30
00:02:36.417 --> 00:02:39.028
Okay.
Can we get a doggy bag?

31
00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.511
Okay.
- They don't do that.

32
00:02:43.511 --> 00:02:45.121
- They don't do that?
- No.

33
00:02:48.777 --> 00:02:49.908
Come on.

34
00:02:49.908 --> 00:02:51.388
These plants are great.

35
00:02:51.388 --> 00:02:52.955
Allegra?

36
00:02:52.955 --> 00:02:56.698
Hi. Chuck... and Khione.

37
00:02:56.698 --> 00:02:59.004
Have you ever noticed
that there is nothing natural

38
00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:00.658
inside S.T.A.R. Labs?

39
00:03:00.658 --> 00:03:03.052
I mean.
there aren't even windows.

40
00:03:03.052 --> 00:03:05.881
Are we underground?

41
00:03:05.881 --> 00:03:07.317
Yeah. I can't.

42
00:03:07.317 --> 00:03:09.363
I'm on my way out. so...

43
00:03:09.363 --> 00:03:11.582
Really? 'Cause...

44
00:03:12.801 --> 00:03:14.846
I had a really great time

45
00:03:14.846 --> 00:03:16.631
getting our groove on
the other night. and...

46
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:19.938
I'm gonna take
such good care of you.

47
00:03:19.938 --> 00:03:23.377
We still haven't talked about
our other close encounter.

48
00:03:23.377 --> 00:03:25.770
Oh. that is a lovely name.

49
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.598
Sure. later.

50
00:03:27.598 --> 00:03:29.687
'Cause right now.
you have science to do.

51
00:03:29.687 --> 00:03:32.995
Oh. yeah. I did find
fragments of Mercer's boomerang

52
00:03:32.995 --> 00:03:35.389
on the dance floor. and I was
gonna run some scans. but--

53
00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.260
Great. We'll talk afterwards.

54
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.131
Okay?

55
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:40.481
I'll be around.

56
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:42.483
Somewhere.

57
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.878
Her name is Kesha.

58
00:03:46.878 --> 00:03:49.359
No. it's Allegra.

59
00:03:51.405 --> 00:03:54.495
Oh. Hello. Kesha.

60
00:03:54.495 --> 00:03:55.800
Hi.

61
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.761
Why is Allegra afraid of you?

62
00:03:59.761 --> 00:04:02.329
Honestly. I--

63
00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.593
I have no idea.

64
00:04:05.593 --> 00:04:07.290
Are you two
not friends anymore?

65
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.380
Oh. no. no.
we're definitely still friends.

66
00:04:12.208 --> 00:04:14.906
Or at least I--

67
00:04:14.906 --> 00:04:17.213
I hope so.

68
00:04:23.915 --> 00:04:26.831
Kesha. meet Bob.

69
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:29.181
Bob. Kesha.

70
00:04:32.228 --> 00:04:34.752
<i>We ID'd three assailants
from a surveillance feed.</i>

71
00:04:34.752 --> 00:04:38.278
Wozzeck. Mercer.
and a Michelle Amar. AKA--

72
00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:41.106
Murmur. yeah--we did
a story on her last year.

73
00:04:41.106 --> 00:04:43.544
She's a angry med student
turned serial killer

74
00:04:43.544 --> 00:04:45.154
who has now teamed up
with a pair

75
00:04:45.154 --> 00:04:48.679
of ruthless tech thieves.

76
00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:51.465
Well. Amar's definitely
got an upgrade.

77
00:04:51.465 --> 00:04:53.728
These filings left behind
from her weapon.

78
00:04:53.728 --> 00:04:55.773
they're almost impossible
to see without a microscope.

79
00:04:55.773 --> 00:04:58.428
but I think they're
cutting-edge nanocircuitry.

80
00:04:58.428 --> 00:05:00.474
just like the new boomerangs
Mercer is using.

81
00:05:00.474 --> 00:05:02.127
And Wozzeck's new fiddle.

82
00:05:02.127 --> 00:05:04.173
I just interviewed the lab tech
and asked him

83
00:05:04.173 --> 00:05:07.132
what Amar and the others
might have wanted.

84
00:05:07.132 --> 00:05:09.700
He said that a temporal scanner
is missing.

85
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.572
Um...

86
00:05:11.572 --> 00:05:14.531
It's a device that measures
radioactive half-lives.

87
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:16.838
It tells you
what year you're in.

88
00:05:16.838 --> 00:05:18.927
Why would they need that?

89
00:05:18.927 --> 00:05:21.799
Don't Rogues have
calendar apps?

90
00:05:21.799 --> 00:05:23.671
Everything they've stolen--

91
00:05:23.671 --> 00:05:25.934
the Roemer
accelerator battery...

92
00:05:27.414 --> 00:05:29.067
The sonic gauntlets...

93
00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:33.463
Now a temporal scanner?

94
00:05:33.463 --> 00:05:35.552
They're all components
you'd need

95
00:05:35.552 --> 00:05:38.729
to build a cosmic treadmill.

96
00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:40.427
Do I want to know
what that is?

97
00:05:40.427 --> 00:05:43.908
It's a machine
that uses kinetic energy

98
00:05:43.908 --> 00:05:46.737
to open quantum wormholes
in space and time.

99
00:05:46.737 --> 00:05:49.523
which is a lot of power
in the wrong hands.

100
00:05:49.523 --> 00:05:51.351
Yeah. I didn't.

101
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:52.830
Godspeed used one in 2049

102
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.136
when he came back to our time.

103
00:05:56.225 --> 00:05:59.054
Now you're telling me
a trio of murderous lunatics

104
00:05:59.054 --> 00:06:03.275
is trying to. what.
build a time machine?

105
00:06:03.275 --> 00:06:05.103
Why?

106
00:06:05.103 --> 00:06:07.236
Whatever their goal is.
it's not all I'm worried about.

107
00:06:07.236 --> 00:06:09.891
There's something worse
than actual time bandits?

108
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:12.720
If they take a cosmic
treadmill on a crime spree.

109
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.983
they could damage
the timeline itself.

110
00:06:14.983 --> 00:06:17.072
Just one paradox
could permanently alter

111
00:06:17.072 --> 00:06:18.639
the fabric of space-time.

112
00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.468
Great. 'cause I wasn't
worried enough before.

113
00:06:21.468 --> 00:06:23.252
I mean. they haven't
built this thing yet.

114
00:06:23.252 --> 00:06:24.819
They're still missing
one major component.

115
00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:26.908
a quantum vibration engine.

116
00:06:26.908 --> 00:06:28.431
Treadmill won't work
without it.

117
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:29.998
Where can they find
one of those?

118
00:06:29.998 --> 00:06:33.480
I don't know.

119
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.525
But I know someone who might.

120
00:06:40.182 --> 00:06:42.880
So you need
a vibration engine?

121
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.057
Not us. no--the Rogues
that stole your gauntlets.

122
00:06:46.057 --> 00:06:47.972
We think they're working
together to steal one.

123
00:06:47.972 --> 00:06:50.148
So that they can build
a more dangerous weapon.

124
00:06:50.148 --> 00:06:53.978
one that could destroy
the entire timeline.

125
00:06:53.978 --> 00:06:57.112
Well. that sounds
super ominous.

126
00:06:57.112 --> 00:06:59.680
Luckily. those jackasses will
have to get in line behind me.

127
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.421
Don't tell us that
you're thinking of moving

128
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:02.944
into time travel too.

129
00:07:02.944 --> 00:07:05.076
Oof. no.
I don't need those headaches.

130
00:07:05.076 --> 00:07:07.209
If I had a vibration engine.
I would supercharge

131
00:07:07.209 --> 00:07:09.429
the new gauntlets
I'm working on.

132
00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:13.737
Sadly. there's only
one such engine in existence--

133
00:07:13.737 --> 00:07:16.610
military-grade.
worth a million.

134
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.569
and basically untouchable.

135
00:07:23.051 --> 00:07:25.314
The DOD is keeping it
at a research facility

136
00:07:25.314 --> 00:07:27.272
outside the city.

137
00:07:27.272 --> 00:07:29.013
That's where they're headed.

138
00:07:29.013 --> 00:07:30.928
Maybe the Flash could
contact the DOD

139
00:07:30.928 --> 00:07:32.234
and see if they could move it

140
00:07:32.234 --> 00:07:33.931
to S.T.A.R. Labs
for safekeeping.

141
00:07:33.931 --> 00:07:35.716
Yeah.
that's not gonna happen.

142
00:07:35.716 --> 00:07:38.719
General Eiling?
You know this guy?

143
00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:42.200
Yeah. Team Flash had some...

144
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.246
rough encounters with him
in the past.

145
00:07:44.246 --> 00:07:46.335
He's not gonna listen to us.

146
00:07:46.335 --> 00:07:49.643
So how do we stop them
from stealing the engine?

147
00:07:49.643 --> 00:07:51.949
Well. that's obvious.

148
00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:53.995
We just have to steal it first.

149
00:07:55.257 --> 00:07:58.347
Hartley.
I'm not gonna get caught

150
00:07:58.347 --> 00:08:00.436
stealing from the DOD.

151
00:08:00.436 --> 00:08:03.352
Then don't send the Flash.

152
00:08:03.352 --> 00:08:05.746
Mercer. Wozzeck.
and Amar teamed up

153
00:08:05.746 --> 00:08:07.922
to steal this engine.
so how about we put together

154
00:08:07.922 --> 00:08:10.620
a little team of Rogues
of our own?

155
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.100
Beat them to the punch?

156
00:08:23.198 --> 00:08:25.461
The vibrational engine's
locked inside a secure vault

157
00:08:25.461 --> 00:08:26.984
in Fort L.U.K.I.A.

158
00:08:26.984 --> 00:08:28.377
But the antechamber
is outfitted

159
00:08:28.377 --> 00:08:29.987
with a heavy-duty
meta dampener.

160
00:08:29.987 --> 00:08:32.294
So we want to get
inside that vault.

161
00:08:32.294 --> 00:08:34.557
we need to cut
the dampener's power first.

162
00:08:34.557 --> 00:08:36.472
Okay. and why can't Barry

163
00:08:36.472 --> 00:08:38.126
just run there
and do it himself?

164
00:08:38.126 --> 00:08:40.171
Because the dampener
is powered

165
00:08:40.171 --> 00:08:42.260
by four different generators.

166
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.480
They all need to be
disconnected simultaneously

167
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.438
in order for me
to gain access to the engine.

168
00:08:46.438 --> 00:08:50.007
Also. each generator has
its own unique power source--

169
00:08:50.007 --> 00:08:51.879
cold fusion. thermal.
you name it.

170
00:08:51.879 --> 00:08:54.142
So we're gonna need
four specialists

171
00:08:54.142 --> 00:08:55.535
to take the generators offline.

172
00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:57.754
You mean four criminals.

173
00:08:57.754 --> 00:09:00.061
Can't we take a beat
and find some other folks

174
00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:01.149
that can help us?

175
00:09:01.149 --> 00:09:02.846
There isn't time.

176
00:09:02.846 --> 00:09:04.805
Tomorrow. the DOD's running
war games exercises

177
00:09:04.805 --> 00:09:06.720
out by Masonville.

178
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.591
It's the one night all year
the fort will be understaffed

179
00:09:08.591 --> 00:09:10.550
and our best chance
to make it inside.

180
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.682
But if you'd rather let
a time machine

181
00:09:12.682 --> 00:09:15.206
fall into the hands
of three psychopaths...

182
00:09:15.206 --> 00:09:17.034
That settles it.

183
00:09:17.034 --> 00:09:19.341
We have to trust our own Rogues
to do the right thing.

184
00:09:19.341 --> 00:09:21.169
What if they don't
feel like it?

185
00:09:21.169 --> 00:09:23.171
Time and space flow
like a river.

186
00:09:23.171 --> 00:09:24.868
If our enemies
disrupt the flow.

187
00:09:24.868 --> 00:09:27.305
then we could all drown.

188
00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.093
They'll do the right thing.
What choice do they have?

189
00:09:32.093 --> 00:09:33.529
We don't have
a choice either.

190
00:09:33.529 --> 00:09:35.705
I know this plan is risky.

191
00:09:35.705 --> 00:09:39.187
but if we go back
to the drawing board now.

192
00:09:39.187 --> 00:09:40.797
it'll be too late
to get the engine

193
00:09:40.797 --> 00:09:42.407
and keep the timeline safe.

194
00:09:42.407 --> 00:09:43.887
We just need to find out
why these other Rogues

195
00:09:43.887 --> 00:09:45.541
want it to begin with.

196
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:47.630
Okay. We'll work on that.

197
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.765
You two focus on recruiting
some old friends.

198
00:09:51.765 --> 00:09:53.549
Yeah.

199
00:09:53.549 --> 00:09:56.073
All right.
where do we start. boss?

200
00:09:56.073 --> 00:09:59.555
Well. Mercer and the others
don't have a tech background.

201
00:09:59.555 --> 00:10:01.992
so I'm guessing
they didn't wake up one morning

202
00:10:01.992 --> 00:10:04.429
and say. "Hey. let's build
a time machine."

203
00:10:04.429 --> 00:10:06.127
So you still think
there's a partner.

204
00:10:06.127 --> 00:10:08.042
Yeah. someone
that we haven't met yet

205
00:10:08.042 --> 00:10:10.218
who wants a cosmic treadmill
and is willing to bankroll

206
00:10:10.218 --> 00:10:12.220
an entire operation to get it.

207
00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.526
A benefactor.

208
00:10:14.526 --> 00:10:16.528
Chester. can you run
a comparative analysis

209
00:10:16.528 --> 00:10:18.705
on the fragment
from Mercer's boomerang

210
00:10:18.705 --> 00:10:20.532
with the filings that Barry
found on Amar's knife

211
00:10:20.532 --> 00:10:22.143
and see if there's any sort
of connection there?

212
00:10:22.143 --> 00:10:24.145
Yeah.

213
00:10:24.145 --> 00:10:26.190
Khione. do you like
scavenger hunts?

214
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.758
I have no idea.
But I can't wait to find out.

215
00:10:28.758 --> 00:10:31.239
Because we need to see
if you and Allegra can see

216
00:10:31.239 --> 00:10:33.807
if they've stolen any old
Rogue tech from the Starchives

217
00:10:33.807 --> 00:10:35.678
to build their new weapons.

218
00:10:35.678 --> 00:10:37.332
I was hoping
that Allegra could

219
00:10:37.332 --> 00:10:38.768
actually help me on this.

220
00:10:38.768 --> 00:10:40.814
Oh. I don't want Khione
to get lost.

221
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.993
Better get started.

222
00:10:51.215 --> 00:10:52.956
So sorry about that.

223
00:10:52.956 --> 00:10:56.177
There's your chia fusion
oat milk pumpkin spice latte.

224
00:10:56.177 --> 00:10:59.310
hold the whip.
iced. not hot this time.

225
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:01.617
Sometimes. I can just get
too carried away.

226
00:11:07.014 --> 00:11:08.668
Jaco.

227
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.452
Hey. it's Officer Barry Allen.

228
00:11:10.452 --> 00:11:11.801
You probably don't remember me.

229
00:11:11.801 --> 00:11:13.368
No. of course I do. Hey.

230
00:11:13.368 --> 00:11:15.152
Yeah. you cleared my name
and you got my son back.

231
00:11:15.152 --> 00:11:16.588
What's up. man?

232
00:11:16.588 --> 00:11:19.069
This is gonna sound
kind of strange.

233
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:21.550
but do you remember
how you said

234
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.291
if I ever needed anything...

235
00:11:23.291 --> 00:11:25.162
Wow. okay.
We need your meta powers

236
00:11:25.162 --> 00:11:27.034
to help save the city.

237
00:11:27.034 --> 00:11:28.383
Hell yeah!

238
00:11:28.383 --> 00:11:30.428
I hate this job.

239
00:11:30.428 --> 00:11:31.952
Let's do this.

240
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.393
Let me get this straight.

241
00:11:41.091 --> 00:11:43.528
You want me to help you

242
00:11:43.528 --> 00:11:45.705
break into a high-tech
facility.

243
00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.402
a fortress no less.

244
00:11:47.402 --> 00:11:51.232
to steal
highly classified technology?

245
00:11:51.232 --> 00:11:55.802
And yet you won't help me
bring Frost back?

246
00:11:59.936 --> 00:12:02.199
Forget about it.

247
00:12:02.199 --> 00:12:04.462
I see you're looking for her
at the bottom of that glass.

248
00:12:04.462 --> 00:12:06.856
How's that working out for you?

249
00:12:06.856 --> 00:12:09.206
You know.
if it wasn't for you.

250
00:12:09.206 --> 00:12:10.991
I could have got Frost back
and I wouldn't be

251
00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:14.429
drinking alone right now.
would I?

252
00:12:14.429 --> 00:12:16.213
I should kill you
for what you did.

253
00:12:16.213 --> 00:12:18.259
What's stopping you? Bourbon?

254
00:12:18.259 --> 00:12:20.783
Hey. hey. hey.

255
00:12:20.783 --> 00:12:22.959
I know how much you're hurting.

256
00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:26.876
But we need someone who can
shut down a thermal generator

257
00:12:26.876 --> 00:12:29.444
before Mercer. Wozzeck.
and Amar gain the power

258
00:12:29.444 --> 00:12:32.012
to destroy an entire timeline.

259
00:12:32.012 --> 00:12:35.363
You've helped us before.

260
00:12:35.363 --> 00:12:38.148
I'm asking you to do it again.

261
00:12:38.148 --> 00:12:40.324
We need you now more than ever.

262
00:12:48.376 --> 00:12:49.812
Yeah.

263
00:12:53.598 --> 00:12:55.035
Wait. so you're in?

264
00:12:57.994 --> 00:13:01.563
I'm gonna do what Frost
would have wanted. yeah.

265
00:13:01.563 --> 00:13:04.435
One thing. though.

266
00:13:04.435 --> 00:13:06.611
I am not taking orders
from him.

267
00:13:10.441 --> 00:13:12.792
<i>Hey. it'll be easier
with our next recruit.</i>

268
00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:14.445
<i>He'll trust me.</i>

269
00:13:14.445 --> 00:13:16.404
Okay.

270
00:13:16.404 --> 00:13:17.927
This is trusting you?

271
00:13:17.927 --> 00:13:20.190
He just likes
to make an entrance.

272
00:13:33.987 --> 00:13:36.467
Well. well. well.

273
00:13:36.467 --> 00:13:39.035
if it isn't my old friend.
the Chemist.

274
00:13:39.035 --> 00:13:41.559
Or should I say Officer Allen?

275
00:13:43.561 --> 00:13:45.302
Who's the new sidekick?

276
00:13:45.302 --> 00:13:47.696
I'm nobody's sidekick.
I'm the Pied Piper.

277
00:13:47.696 --> 00:13:50.090
Ah. didn't recognize you
without the hood on.

278
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:51.613
- Hmm.
- Just like your mama's

279
00:13:51.613 --> 00:13:53.354
not gonna recognize your faces

280
00:13:53.354 --> 00:13:55.660
once my associates and I are
through rearranging them.

281
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.053
You know. I ended up
doing a stint

282
00:13:57.053 --> 00:13:58.925
in Iron Heights because of you.

283
00:13:58.925 --> 00:14:00.665
Yes.

284
00:14:00.665 --> 00:14:02.406
How did you get out?

285
00:14:02.406 --> 00:14:05.105
Easy. Turned state's witness.

286
00:14:05.105 --> 00:14:06.497
Gave up the real mastermind

287
00:14:06.497 --> 00:14:08.760
behind the CCPD
hostage situation.

288
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.675
got my
get-out-of-jail-free card.

289
00:14:10.675 --> 00:14:12.460
You squealed on Amunet?

290
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.244
I thought
she was your soul mate.

291
00:14:14.244 --> 00:14:15.419
True love is a lie.

292
00:14:15.419 --> 00:14:17.204
Damn straight.

293
00:14:17.204 --> 00:14:22.426
Goldface's only sidekick
is cold. hard cash.

294
00:14:22.426 --> 00:14:24.211
He ain't some bleeding heart.

295
00:14:24.211 --> 00:14:25.821
Ain't it the truth.

296
00:14:25.821 --> 00:14:27.910
And he sure as hell
doesn't stay up all night

297
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.130
reading "Dr. Zhivago."
then sobbing

298
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.219
when Yuri dies
before finding Lara.

299
00:14:32.219 --> 00:14:34.090
Damn it. Carver!

300
00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:36.223
You were told that
in confidence.

301
00:14:36.223 --> 00:14:40.488
Book club will remain
a safe space.

302
00:14:40.488 --> 00:14:43.143
Anyway. bye-bye.

303
00:14:43.143 --> 00:14:45.188
No. no. wait.

304
00:14:45.188 --> 00:14:48.626
I'm on another undercover
assignment as the Chemist.

305
00:14:48.626 --> 00:14:50.585
I need to stop
a new group of Rogues

306
00:14:50.585 --> 00:14:52.630
from punching a hole
in the timeline.

307
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.110
You talking about
the three that have been

308
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.417
pulling tech heists all week?

309
00:14:56.417 --> 00:14:58.636
Yeah. I mean.
if they finish this machine.

310
00:14:58.636 --> 00:15:00.900
they could go back in time
and steal your turf

311
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.032
before you even got
in the game.

312
00:15:03.032 --> 00:15:05.252
Help us and you can
level the playing field

313
00:15:05.252 --> 00:15:06.644
before that happens.

314
00:15:11.998 --> 00:15:14.391
As the old proverb goes.

315
00:15:14.391 --> 00:15:16.611
"The enemy of my enemy
is my friend."

316
00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:18.265
- Yeah.
- Fine. Chemist.

317
00:15:18.265 --> 00:15:20.223
What's your plan?

318
00:15:20.223 --> 00:15:22.051
Um...

319
00:15:26.099 --> 00:15:28.928
Well. it's kind of
a work in progress right now.

320
00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:31.843
but here's what we're thinking.

321
00:15:31.843 --> 00:15:35.673
Looks like Goldface has
a few friends.

322
00:15:35.673 --> 00:15:38.154
Well. just like
the boss thought.

323
00:15:41.288 --> 00:15:44.247
They'll find out soon enough.

324
00:15:47.076 --> 00:15:51.298
And then. they'll scream.

325
00:15:57.217 --> 00:16:00.307
Lot of gold
in these walls. Allen.

326
00:16:00.307 --> 00:16:02.265
I'm supposed to believe
that you can afford all this

327
00:16:02.265 --> 00:16:05.660
on a public servant's salary?

328
00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:09.229
No. I'm missing something.

329
00:16:09.229 --> 00:16:11.535
I'm gonna find out
what it is too.

330
00:16:11.535 --> 00:16:13.189
Oh. you have no idea.

331
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:15.148
Hang on.
didn't you knock over

332
00:16:15.148 --> 00:16:17.237
my operation back in 2016?

333
00:16:17.237 --> 00:16:19.065
Operation?

334
00:16:19.065 --> 00:16:20.762
Please. the place looked like
a farmers market.

335
00:16:20.762 --> 00:16:22.546
Can we settle this later?

336
00:16:22.546 --> 00:16:23.852
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

337
00:16:23.852 --> 00:16:26.072
You listen to the man.
all right?

338
00:16:26.072 --> 00:16:28.857
This is a serious mission.
We're gonna save lives today.

339
00:16:28.857 --> 00:16:30.946
Aren't you the fool that
opened up an active volcano

340
00:16:30.946 --> 00:16:32.817
underneath Central City?

341
00:16:32.817 --> 00:16:34.906
Oh. yeah. right after he
killed my favorite bartender.

342
00:16:34.906 --> 00:16:36.647
I was cleared
of those charges.

343
00:16:36.647 --> 00:16:38.214
You're not the smartest guy
in the room.

344
00:16:38.214 --> 00:16:40.521
Exactly. I am.

345
00:16:40.521 --> 00:16:42.914
So if I could have everyone's
attention. the plan--

346
00:16:42.914 --> 00:16:44.394
Your bar plays
terrible music!

347
00:16:44.394 --> 00:16:45.787
- Excuse me?
- You cost me more gold

348
00:16:45.787 --> 00:16:46.831
than I can lift.
- Disco is dead. dude.

349
00:16:46.831 --> 00:16:47.919
Can't be that much. then.

350
00:16:47.919 --> 00:16:49.443
- Guys!
- Who cares?

351
00:16:51.053 --> 00:16:53.055
The plan.

352
00:16:53.055 --> 00:16:54.578
Ah.

353
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:03.935
Thank you.

354
00:17:03.935 --> 00:17:07.069
So you're sure the same
person made all three weapons.

355
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:08.462
No doubt.

356
00:17:08.462 --> 00:17:10.986
Mercer's boomerang.
Wozzeck's violin.

357
00:17:10.986 --> 00:17:13.336
even Amar's knife.
all uniquely designed.

358
00:17:13.336 --> 00:17:15.730
but I still can't track
where they've been manufactured

359
00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.341
or by who.

360
00:17:18.341 --> 00:17:21.301
This is my last chance
to break a story of a lifetime.

361
00:17:21.301 --> 00:17:23.085
and all I have is
a bunch of tech

362
00:17:23.085 --> 00:17:25.740
that nobody understands.

363
00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:29.439
I am going to take five.

364
00:17:35.837 --> 00:17:38.883
What's with folks today?

365
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:42.583
So then the four of you
will disable the generators

366
00:17:42.583 --> 00:17:44.846
while I use my s--

367
00:17:44.846 --> 00:17:47.066
CSI know-how

368
00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:49.981
to open the vault
and grab the engine.

369
00:17:51.809 --> 00:17:54.203
Any questions?

370
00:17:54.203 --> 00:17:57.032
What happens once we score
the vibration engine?

371
00:17:57.032 --> 00:17:59.208
Who gets it?

372
00:17:59.208 --> 00:18:01.471
No one--no one gets it.

373
00:18:01.471 --> 00:18:03.343
We'll bring it back
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

374
00:18:03.343 --> 00:18:06.911
And then I'll return it
to the DOD as soon as possible.

375
00:18:06.911 --> 00:18:08.652
That engine's worth
a cool mil.

376
00:18:08.652 --> 00:18:11.786
If I'm gonna risk my
hard-earned freedom to get it.

377
00:18:11.786 --> 00:18:13.527
I want my cut.

378
00:18:13.527 --> 00:18:15.268
Guys. we all know
that if anybody should get it.

379
00:18:15.268 --> 00:18:16.921
it's me.

380
00:18:16.921 --> 00:18:18.532
I'm the only cryogenics
engineer in this room.

381
00:18:18.532 --> 00:18:20.490
and. Barry. you know
I will put it to good use.

382
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:23.232
Guys. nobody's taking
the engine.

383
00:18:23.232 --> 00:18:26.627
Well. now. I know
stealing's wrong. Bar.

384
00:18:26.627 --> 00:18:28.368
but. you know.
I could use my cut

385
00:18:28.368 --> 00:18:30.718
to put Harold through college.

386
00:18:30.718 --> 00:18:33.634
Higher education. probably
a stretch for your offspring.

387
00:18:33.634 --> 00:18:35.375
- Say that again. buddy.
- Okay. hey.

388
00:18:35.375 --> 00:18:37.464
Look. if anybody deserves
that engine. it's me.

389
00:18:37.464 --> 00:18:39.248
- Oh. my God.
- I came up with the plan.

390
00:18:39.248 --> 00:18:41.511
I've been after it for months.
- Yeah. why?

391
00:18:41.511 --> 00:18:43.470
So you can sell it
for yourself?

392
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.907
Oh. I don't need money.

393
00:18:45.907 --> 00:18:49.171
Tech like that could push my
new gauntlets off the charts--

394
00:18:49.171 --> 00:18:50.520
to protect my team.

395
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.913
Uh-huh. Yeah.

396
00:18:51.913 --> 00:18:57.223
I'm doing this for me.
not your crew.

397
00:18:57.223 --> 00:19:00.835
There he is. the guy who
sold out the woman he loves.

398
00:19:04.317 --> 00:19:05.753
You got a big mouth.

399
00:19:06.841 --> 00:19:07.972
Mm.

400
00:19:07.972 --> 00:19:09.365
Pretty too.

401
00:19:12.542 --> 00:19:14.675
Good thing
there's no gold in these.

402
00:19:26.382 --> 00:19:27.862
That won't make a difference.

403
00:19:31.474 --> 00:19:32.997
Hey. hey!

404
00:19:34.869 --> 00:19:37.698
Nobody is taking the engine.

405
00:19:40.091 --> 00:19:41.832
We're changing the plan.
all right?

406
00:19:41.832 --> 00:19:44.270
No more splitting up.
I'm sticking with you.

407
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:46.010
Okay. we're all gonna
stick together. which means

408
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.099
I will be with all of you
every step of the way.

409
00:19:51.538 --> 00:19:55.759
You know. gentlemen.
he doesn't seem to trust us.

410
00:19:55.759 --> 00:19:58.284
Wanna know why?

411
00:19:58.284 --> 00:20:01.156
We're just a bunch
of criminals to him.

412
00:20:01.156 --> 00:20:04.725
You don't trust me either?

413
00:20:09.382 --> 00:20:13.603
Guys. this mission is
too important

414
00:20:13.603 --> 00:20:15.083
to risk screwing up.

415
00:20:15.083 --> 00:20:17.303
Well then maybe
you shouldn't be

416
00:20:17.303 --> 00:20:20.436
a part of it. Officer Allen.

417
00:20:25.702 --> 00:20:29.010
You can't be serious.

418
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:32.622
This is a five-person plan.
Okay? You need me too.

419
00:20:32.622 --> 00:20:34.885
Oof. not if I built
a cryo-circuit

420
00:20:34.885 --> 00:20:36.452
to disable
the thermal generator.

421
00:20:36.452 --> 00:20:39.803
See. 'cause then I could
take the engine myself...

422
00:20:39.803 --> 00:20:42.153
yeah. and make this
a four-man job.

423
00:20:44.547 --> 00:20:47.550
Looks like you've got
a mutiny. Caesar.

424
00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.684
Guys. if we don't
get this engine first.

425
00:20:50.684 --> 00:20:55.297
the whole timeline is at stake.

426
00:20:55.297 --> 00:20:56.559
We have to work together.

427
00:20:56.559 --> 00:20:59.562
Oh. we will.

428
00:21:04.437 --> 00:21:08.571
Jaco.

429
00:21:11.313 --> 00:21:12.880
I'm sorry. Barry.

430
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.187
If you can't trust us.

431
00:21:16.187 --> 00:21:17.885
we can't trust you.

432
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.463
The whole team's gone.

433
00:21:30.463 --> 00:21:32.465
And it's my fault.

434
00:21:32.465 --> 00:21:34.031
Let me guess. they didn't
want Big Brother

435
00:21:34.031 --> 00:21:36.469
watching their every move.

436
00:21:36.469 --> 00:21:38.427
I've reworked this plan
from every angle.

437
00:21:38.427 --> 00:21:40.299
I can't get the engine
without them.

438
00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:43.563
Maybe they'll get it
before the other Rogues do?

439
00:21:43.563 --> 00:21:45.129
Yeah. but if they don't.

440
00:21:45.129 --> 00:21:46.783
the Rogues are gonna finish
the treadmill.

441
00:21:46.783 --> 00:21:49.830
and then the whole timeline
will be in jeopardy.

442
00:21:52.093 --> 00:21:55.836
Do you have any leads
on a benefactor?

443
00:21:55.836 --> 00:21:58.665
No. All dead ends.

444
00:22:03.147 --> 00:22:05.541
I guess we're both
running out of time.

445
00:22:08.065 --> 00:22:09.980
I wish we were back in Paris.

446
00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.634
Mm.

447
00:22:13.593 --> 00:22:17.118
Hey. what is it?

448
00:22:17.118 --> 00:22:21.949
Lately. our lives have been
all about what's coming

449
00:22:21.949 --> 00:22:27.389
and how we can accomplish

450
00:22:27.389 --> 00:22:29.826
all of these tasks
before little Nora gets here.

451
00:22:29.826 --> 00:22:33.613
but there's nothing for me
to accomplish by myself.

452
00:22:35.397 --> 00:22:38.269
And I'm just worried
that once we become parents...

453
00:22:38.269 --> 00:22:42.796
You won't have time.

454
00:22:42.796 --> 00:22:45.799
That's why you wanted to come
to the crime scene.

455
00:22:45.799 --> 00:22:48.018
why you've been
pushing yourself so hard

456
00:22:48.018 --> 00:22:50.151
to find out who's bankrolling
the Rogues.

457
00:22:50.151 --> 00:22:52.675
Yeah.

458
00:22:52.675 --> 00:22:54.198
I just feel like
if I don't break

459
00:22:54.198 --> 00:22:58.507
one more big story
before Nora comes.

460
00:22:58.507 --> 00:23:00.553
that I might not get
the chance.

461
00:23:00.553 --> 00:23:04.731
Hey.

462
00:23:04.731 --> 00:23:07.603
when you're pregnant.
and afterward.

463
00:23:07.603 --> 00:23:09.823
when you're a mom.

464
00:23:09.823 --> 00:23:13.870
you will still have time
to pursue your dreams.

465
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:17.047
Because when you need
that time. I'll be there

466
00:23:17.047 --> 00:23:20.181
to change diapers

467
00:23:20.181 --> 00:23:23.619
or stay up with a bottle
for late feedings.

468
00:23:23.619 --> 00:23:25.795
Or I'll fight crime
on three hours of sleep.

469
00:23:28.189 --> 00:23:30.191
I want you
to have everything.

470
00:23:30.191 --> 00:23:34.021
Yeah. I want that
for you too. Barry.

471
00:23:34.021 --> 00:23:36.197
I think
it's easier said than done.

472
00:23:36.197 --> 00:23:39.853
I know. but we just have
to trust that

473
00:23:39.853 --> 00:23:44.205
just like we're making time
for us as a couple now.

474
00:23:44.205 --> 00:23:47.861
we'll also continue
to help each other grow.

475
00:23:49.732 --> 00:23:52.256
Two Pulitzers. remember?

476
00:23:54.302 --> 00:23:59.307
Maybe three.

477
00:24:08.534 --> 00:24:10.274
Maybe we're not the only ones

478
00:24:10.274 --> 00:24:12.494
who need the freedom
to follow our own paths.

479
00:24:16.716 --> 00:24:19.109
Yeah. you're right.

480
00:24:19.109 --> 00:24:21.068
I mean. I was so worried

481
00:24:21.068 --> 00:24:25.202
about whether or not
we could trust these Rogues.

482
00:24:25.202 --> 00:24:28.118
Now I need to give them
a reason to trust me.

483
00:24:33.167 --> 00:24:35.474
Iris. stop the presses!

484
00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:38.346
I've always wanted to say that.

485
00:24:38.346 --> 00:24:41.784
Chester. look.
about earlier. I'm sorry

486
00:24:41.784 --> 00:24:42.916
for pushing you too hard--

487
00:24:42.916 --> 00:24:44.613
Oh. no. no. Thanks for that.

488
00:24:44.613 --> 00:24:48.095
But turns out that was
just the push I needed.

489
00:24:48.095 --> 00:24:51.098
So the Rogues' new toys
resemble advanced prototypes

490
00:24:51.098 --> 00:24:53.579
being developed by the most
revolutionary company

491
00:24:53.579 --> 00:24:56.973
in the game. Wayne Enterprises.

492
00:24:56.973 --> 00:25:00.237
As in Gotham City?

493
00:25:00.237 --> 00:25:02.413
How would the benefactor
get their hands on that?

494
00:25:02.413 --> 00:25:04.024
I don't know.

495
00:25:04.024 --> 00:25:06.069
But it looks like
we need to call Gotham.

496
00:25:10.857 --> 00:25:14.469
Ah. the fresh air just
makes me feel so alive.

497
00:25:14.469 --> 00:25:17.211
And it's the perfect break
from our scavenger hunt.

498
00:25:17.211 --> 00:25:19.909
Those Starchives are
really dark and gloomy.

499
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:21.781
And we would have
been done by now

500
00:25:21.781 --> 00:25:25.175
had you not asked a question
about every single gadget.

501
00:25:25.175 --> 00:25:27.395
Do I make you uncomfortable?

502
00:25:29.658 --> 00:25:32.052
I did vote against
you staying around.

503
00:25:32.052 --> 00:25:35.316
so makes it kind of awkward.

504
00:25:35.316 --> 00:25:37.579
Not for me.

505
00:25:37.579 --> 00:25:42.018
Do I remind you
of Caitlin. or Frost?

506
00:25:42.018 --> 00:25:44.412
Were you two close?

507
00:25:44.412 --> 00:25:47.328
I have a complicated
relationship with family.

508
00:25:47.328 --> 00:25:49.983
as in I don't have one.

509
00:25:49.983 --> 00:25:53.552
And Frost was the closest thing
I had to a big sister.

510
00:25:53.552 --> 00:25:55.205
And now I'm in this situation.

511
00:25:55.205 --> 00:25:57.033
and I don't have anyone
to talk about it with.

512
00:25:57.033 --> 00:26:00.341
Is the situation
with Chester?

513
00:26:00.341 --> 00:26:03.039
Because you were
avoiding him earlier.

514
00:26:03.039 --> 00:26:04.127
Are you in love with him?

515
00:26:04.127 --> 00:26:07.740
What? No.

516
00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.743
I mean. he seems very nice
and very smart.

517
00:26:10.743 --> 00:26:14.050
He's a genius...

518
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:16.575
and a really good kisser.

519
00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:21.188
But I can't get involved
right now. so...

520
00:26:21.188 --> 00:26:23.016
Do you want
to kiss him again?

521
00:26:23.016 --> 00:26:24.365
I could talk to him for you.

522
00:26:24.365 --> 00:26:27.542
No. I'll--

523
00:26:27.542 --> 00:26:29.805
I'll figure it out.

524
00:26:29.805 --> 00:26:31.198
I see.

525
00:26:31.198 --> 00:26:33.635
You're a daffodil.

526
00:26:33.635 --> 00:26:34.897
A what?

527
00:26:34.897 --> 00:26:36.551
A daffodil.

528
00:26:36.551 --> 00:26:38.771
A daffodil seed doesn't want
to be hurt either.

529
00:26:38.771 --> 00:26:42.296
so it clings to the stem.
when really.

530
00:26:42.296 --> 00:26:44.994
in order for it to grow.
it should let go

531
00:26:44.994 --> 00:26:47.214
so it can be carried
by the wind

532
00:26:47.214 --> 00:26:50.043
and blossom into a flower.

533
00:27:10.411 --> 00:27:13.457
You guys got room
for one more?

534
00:27:17.723 --> 00:27:21.161
Look. Barry.
this isn't a good idea.

535
00:27:21.161 --> 00:27:23.206
I was wrong.

536
00:27:23.206 --> 00:27:26.470
We're gonna follow
Hartley's plan. split up.

537
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:28.168
Look. as soon
as you all started

538
00:27:28.168 --> 00:27:30.997
fighting over the engine.
I took the easy way out.

539
00:27:30.997 --> 00:27:33.695
I gave up on all of you.
instead of trusting

540
00:27:33.695 --> 00:27:36.393
we could come up
with a fair solution.

541
00:27:36.393 --> 00:27:39.962
Okay.
What might that be exactly?

542
00:27:39.962 --> 00:27:41.398
Hartley's gonna
get the engine.

543
00:27:41.398 --> 00:27:43.487
Yes!

544
00:27:43.487 --> 00:27:45.402
As long as he promises
only to use it

545
00:27:45.402 --> 00:27:46.926
to keep his team safe.

546
00:27:46.926 --> 00:27:48.928
Yeah.

547
00:27:48.928 --> 00:27:51.234
And pays you all 1/4 million
each in compensation.

548
00:27:51.234 --> 00:27:52.801
What?

549
00:27:52.801 --> 00:27:54.629
You said you didn't need
the money.

550
00:27:54.629 --> 00:27:56.892
That's a fair trade.

551
00:27:56.892 --> 00:27:58.111
Hang on.

552
00:27:58.111 --> 00:27:59.416
Something's rotten in Denmark.

553
00:27:59.416 --> 00:28:01.331
We left the city hours ago.

554
00:28:01.331 --> 00:28:03.899
How were you able
to catch up with us?

555
00:28:03.899 --> 00:28:06.510
And why do we need to disable
meta dampeners

556
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.600
so you can do "forensics"?

557
00:28:12.734 --> 00:28:14.997
Dude. come on.

558
00:28:14.997 --> 00:28:17.608
Even I figured it out.

559
00:28:17.608 --> 00:28:20.960
Barry Allen's the Flash.

560
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.876
They have the same
Jitters order.

561
00:28:23.876 --> 00:28:25.921
Officer Chemist is the--

562
00:28:25.921 --> 00:28:28.402
yeah. no. I see it now.

563
00:28:28.402 --> 00:28:29.882
All right. is there
anything else. gentlemen.

564
00:28:29.882 --> 00:28:31.622
or do you think maybe
we should proceed?

565
00:28:31.622 --> 00:28:34.060
Just don't drop my engine
when we get in there.

566
00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.540
Okay. he always thinks
we're gonna drop something.

567
00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.325
- Anybody hungry?
- I could eat.

568
00:29:06.483 --> 00:29:09.748
Dampener's live.

569
00:29:09.748 --> 00:29:12.620
I've got eyes on the vault.
Is everybody in position?

570
00:29:21.847 --> 00:29:22.978
Affirmative.

571
00:29:25.415 --> 00:29:27.766
Let's get this party started.

572
00:29:30.856 --> 00:29:33.510
Ready to ice this sucker.

573
00:29:39.516 --> 00:29:41.823
Time to light this match.

574
00:29:41.823 --> 00:29:43.912
Okay.

575
00:29:43.912 --> 00:29:48.264
Three. two. one. go.

576
00:29:56.664 --> 00:29:59.928
Feel those gold circuits fry.

577
00:30:06.239 --> 00:30:07.806
Come on. boys!

578
00:30:07.806 --> 00:30:09.546
We got this!

579
00:30:12.201 --> 00:30:14.160
It's working. Keep going.

580
00:30:41.622 --> 00:30:43.189
I've got it.

581
00:30:45.931 --> 00:30:46.888
Time to go.

582
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.937
What happened?

583
00:30:51.937 --> 00:30:53.634
The generator's back on.

584
00:30:53.634 --> 00:30:56.767
Nuh-uh.
No. mine's still down.

585
00:30:56.767 --> 00:30:59.553
- Same here.
- Who dropped the ball?

586
00:30:59.553 --> 00:31:02.208
Sorry. not sorry. Barry.

587
00:31:05.124 --> 00:31:06.995
You want the engine
for yourself.

588
00:31:06.995 --> 00:31:09.693
Mm-mm.
It's for my benefactor.

589
00:31:09.693 --> 00:31:12.218
Why am I not surprised?

590
00:31:12.218 --> 00:31:13.915
Barry. I'm on my way.

591
00:31:38.592 --> 00:31:40.811
Game over. Barry Allen.

592
00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.694
Why are you doing this?

593
00:31:53.694 --> 00:31:56.653
You're never gonna
help me bring back Frost.

594
00:31:56.653 --> 00:31:58.655
So I had no choice

595
00:31:58.655 --> 00:32:00.744
but to join up
with someone who will.

596
00:32:00.744 --> 00:32:04.313
For the record. my new boss
found me at O'Shaughnessy's

597
00:32:04.313 --> 00:32:06.185
right before you did. Speedo.

598
00:32:07.882 --> 00:32:11.842
Made me an offer
I couldn't refuse.

599
00:32:11.842 --> 00:32:13.061
Look. I know you feel like

600
00:32:13.061 --> 00:32:14.280
you've lost Frost
all over again--

601
00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.108
Shut up!

602
00:32:16.108 --> 00:32:17.761
You do not know
what it feels like

603
00:32:17.761 --> 00:32:19.938
to lose the only person
who's ever loved you.

604
00:32:24.116 --> 00:32:28.076
Think you can make it?

605
00:32:28.076 --> 00:32:31.123
Run. Barry. run.

606
00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.574
It didn't have
to be this way.

607
00:33:02.197 --> 00:33:04.373
Finally somebody
worth killing. huh?

608
00:33:04.373 --> 00:33:06.897
Now. Captain. it's gonna take
more than a few toys

609
00:33:06.897 --> 00:33:08.421
to take me down.

610
00:33:08.421 --> 00:33:10.727
<i>I got the package.
Time to go.</i>

611
00:33:10.727 --> 00:33:12.294
You're lucky I'm in a rush.

612
00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:17.517
Could've had some fun.

613
00:33:53.857 --> 00:33:55.294
What the hell?

614
00:34:42.776 --> 00:34:44.517
LIPS suck. by the way.

615
00:34:44.517 --> 00:34:46.301
You should try listening
to a real band

616
00:34:46.301 --> 00:34:47.607
like Joy Division.

617
00:34:50.653 --> 00:34:53.221
They're very influential
to the industrial metal scene.

618
00:34:53.221 --> 00:34:55.484
Oh. don't bands-plain
to me. hesher.

619
00:34:55.484 --> 00:34:57.486
I'm saying they inspired

620
00:34:57.486 --> 00:34:59.401
my new favorite band.
Nine Inch Nails.

621
00:34:59.401 --> 00:35:01.664
No way.
That's <i>my</i> favorite band.

622
00:35:01.664 --> 00:35:04.711
Wait... what?

623
00:35:06.147 --> 00:35:08.367
I like your jacket.

624
00:35:08.367 --> 00:35:11.239
I like your hair.

625
00:35:11.239 --> 00:35:14.329
I like your chain wallet.

626
00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.682
<i>Rendezvous is in one minute.
so hustle.</i>

627
00:35:19.682 --> 00:35:22.685
No. Baby.

628
00:35:31.868 --> 00:35:35.524
See you in the mosh pits.
hot stuff.

629
00:35:41.748 --> 00:35:44.968
<i>They're making off
with the engine.</i>

630
00:35:44.968 --> 00:35:48.146
<i>Sorry. Barry.</i>

631
00:35:48.146 --> 00:35:50.757
No. they're not.

632
00:35:50.757 --> 00:35:53.499
Where's our cold boy
on the inside?

633
00:35:53.499 --> 00:35:54.935
Is this him?

634
00:35:54.935 --> 00:35:57.067
We have to jet. now.

635
00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.290
Nobody's going anywhere.

636
00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:03.552
Hand over the engine.

637
00:36:03.552 --> 00:36:05.772
Sorry. Goldilocks.

638
00:36:05.772 --> 00:36:08.209
But I am all out of porridge.

639
00:36:08.209 --> 00:36:09.906
What are we gonna do?

640
00:36:09.906 --> 00:36:12.039
Can we really take on
all of them?

641
00:36:12.039 --> 00:36:14.346
Yeah. we can.

642
00:36:17.262 --> 00:36:18.306
Together.

643
00:36:45.986 --> 00:36:47.248
What?

644
00:37:04.396 --> 00:37:05.701
Thawne?

645
00:37:07.442 --> 00:37:11.054
Where's your speed now.
Flash?

646
00:37:29.638 --> 00:37:31.510
So the Rogues' new partner
is a speedster?

647
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:33.076
Yeah.

648
00:37:33.076 --> 00:37:35.340
It was the scariest thing
I've ever seen.

649
00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.037
And it gets worse.

650
00:37:37.037 --> 00:37:39.735
He's using negative speed.
which is how he was able

651
00:37:39.735 --> 00:37:42.129
to dampen my speed
for a few minutes.

652
00:37:42.129 --> 00:37:44.653
Why would a speedster need
a time machine?

653
00:37:47.047 --> 00:37:49.528
"And darkness and decay

654
00:37:49.528 --> 00:37:54.184
and the Red Death held
illimitable dominion over all."

655
00:37:54.184 --> 00:37:55.751
Edgar Allan Poe.

656
00:37:55.751 --> 00:37:57.536
Then you know the story.

657
00:37:57.536 --> 00:37:59.929
Seven revelers at a masquerade.

658
00:37:59.929 --> 00:38:02.062
killed by the stranger
in their midst.

659
00:38:04.194 --> 00:38:08.460
Look. I know
what you're all thinking.

660
00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.289
But this is about more
than stealing tech now.

661
00:38:11.289 --> 00:38:13.247
This new speedster.
I don't know who he is yet.

662
00:38:13.247 --> 00:38:15.684
I don't know why he wants
to build a time machine.

663
00:38:15.684 --> 00:38:18.905
But Team Flash can't
stop him on their own.

664
00:38:18.905 --> 00:38:21.777
especially now if he has
his own Rogue army.

665
00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.128
I need your help.

666
00:38:27.261 --> 00:38:29.132
All of you.

667
00:38:29.132 --> 00:38:32.788
Barry. this is not
what we signed up for.

668
00:38:34.616 --> 00:38:37.140
But...

669
00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.579
you know. I have a son
to keep safe in this town.

670
00:38:40.579 --> 00:38:44.713
So I guess if you need me...

671
00:38:46.976 --> 00:38:48.848
Fine.

672
00:38:48.848 --> 00:38:50.545
I always did like
a good underdog story.

673
00:38:50.545 --> 00:38:52.982
That. and if
Central City gets leveled.

674
00:38:52.982 --> 00:38:54.332
you're out of business.

675
00:38:54.332 --> 00:38:55.811
I said I'd help.

676
00:38:58.118 --> 00:39:01.774
Find out who this guy is.
find out his weakness.

677
00:39:01.774 --> 00:39:03.079
then call us.

678
00:39:08.694 --> 00:39:11.305
I guess trusting them
wasn't a bad idea after all.

679
00:39:11.305 --> 00:39:14.134
Yeah. I know.

680
00:39:14.134 --> 00:39:18.791
I just keep thinking.
this speedster.

681
00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:21.184
what if they're the new
Negative Speed Force Avatar?

682
00:39:21.184 --> 00:39:24.318
Yeah. I feel like we just
got rid of the last one.

683
00:39:24.318 --> 00:39:27.147
There's something else.

684
00:39:27.147 --> 00:39:31.020
There was a symbol
on his armor.

685
00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:32.239
It looked like a bat.

686
00:39:35.111 --> 00:39:37.723
Barry. we have to talk
to Chester.

687
00:39:40.421 --> 00:39:43.076
So I just got off the phone
with Luke Fox.

688
00:39:43.076 --> 00:39:45.295
Mercer's boomerang.
Amar's knives.

689
00:39:45.295 --> 00:39:48.255
even Wozzeck's funky violin.

690
00:39:48.255 --> 00:39:52.825
Luke thinks they all resemble
advanced WayneTech designs.

691
00:39:52.825 --> 00:39:56.698
But their nano-tech foundations
are beyond bleeding-edge.

692
00:39:56.698 --> 00:39:59.397
So he has no idea
who we're up against.

693
00:39:59.397 --> 00:40:02.095
What about this new speedster
wearing a bat symbol?

694
00:40:02.095 --> 00:40:04.619
Team Bat's never fought
a baddie dressed like that.

695
00:40:04.619 --> 00:40:08.318
But they have some drama
of their own.

696
00:40:08.318 --> 00:40:12.279
A few weeks ago.
Ryan Wilder went out on patrol.

697
00:40:14.107 --> 00:40:17.240
She never came back.

698
00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:19.025
We got a new speedster
in a bat suit.

699
00:40:19.025 --> 00:40:20.722
and Batwoman is missing?

700
00:40:20.722 --> 00:40:23.203
Could that be a coincidence?

701
00:40:23.203 --> 00:40:26.119
Okay. so what do we do now?

702
00:40:26.119 --> 00:40:27.816
We find this new speedster.

703
00:40:31.037 --> 00:40:32.778
And we stop him.

704
00:40:40.438 --> 00:40:42.178
Got you your engine.

705
00:40:42.178 --> 00:40:46.792
Oh. and now
you want a prize. abs?

706
00:40:48.968 --> 00:40:50.883
I think he needs
a little upgrade

707
00:40:50.883 --> 00:40:52.580
on his little bracelets.

708
00:40:56.715 --> 00:40:59.718
All right. look. I kept
my end of the bargain.

709
00:40:59.718 --> 00:41:02.764
It's time for you
to give me what I want.

710
00:41:02.764 --> 00:41:04.940
- Mm...
- All right. fine.

711
00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:07.465
Guess I'll take this little
puppy over to the Flash. then.

712
00:41:10.119 --> 00:41:13.558
That would be a mistake.

713
00:41:15.168 --> 00:41:17.257
Then give me
what you said you would.

714
00:41:17.257 --> 00:41:18.998
a way to bring Frost back.

715
00:41:18.998 --> 00:41:23.263
After my mission is complete.

716
00:41:23.263 --> 00:41:24.873
That wasn't the deal.

717
00:41:24.873 --> 00:41:26.832
It is now.

718
00:41:26.832 --> 00:41:29.399
How am I even supposed
to trust you. huh?

719
00:41:29.399 --> 00:41:30.923
I mean. we don't even know
who you are

720
00:41:30.923 --> 00:41:33.360
underneath that mask.

721
00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:37.495
I will tell you who I am.

722
00:41:43.283 --> 00:41:48.375
I am vengeance.

723
00:42:19.014 --> 00:42:20.276
Greg. move your head.
