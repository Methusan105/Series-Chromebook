00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:06.354
<i>To understand what
I'm about to tell you.</i>

2
00:00:06.354 --> 00:00:08.399
<i>you need to
do something first.</i>

3
00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:10.967
<i>You need to believe
in the impossible.</i>

4
00:00:10.967 --> 00:00:12.229
<i>Can you do that?</i>

5
00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:13.709
<i>Nope. I can't believe it.</i>

6
00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.754
Eddie Thawne is the avatar

7
00:00:15.754 --> 00:00:17.017
of the Negative Speed Force?

8
00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.322
Yes. That's the reason
the crystal

9
00:00:18.322 --> 00:00:20.150
has been attacking us
across time.

10
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.804
It was charging with power.

11
00:00:21.804 --> 00:00:23.284
Sounds to me like

12
00:00:23.284 --> 00:00:25.112
we could really use the Flash
right about now.

13
00:00:25.112 --> 00:00:26.765
Guys. can you hear me?

14
00:00:28.724 --> 00:00:30.073
Barry!

15
00:00:30.073 --> 00:00:31.596
Oh. thank God
you got out of there.

16
00:00:31.596 --> 00:00:32.858
Barely.

17
00:00:32.858 --> 00:00:34.208
I'm on my way back
to the hospital.

18
00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:36.036
Any sign of damage
to the timeline?

19
00:00:37.385 --> 00:00:39.256
No temporal fracturing yet. boss.

20
00:00:39.256 --> 00:00:41.867
It's already started in 2049.
If it spreads here...

21
00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:45.958
It'll threaten
our entire existence.

22
00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.628
What the hell?

23
00:01:05.543 --> 00:01:07.806
Flash!

24
00:01:07.806 --> 00:01:09.417
What did you do?

25
00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:11.636
Is this some kind of a prison?

26
00:01:11.636 --> 00:01:13.508
Because you can't hold me!

27
00:01:13.508 --> 00:01:14.422
You know that!

28
00:01:14.422 --> 00:01:17.990
Who dares disrupt my revenge?

29
00:01:20.906 --> 00:01:23.692
I was about to slit
that brat imposter's throat.

30
00:01:23.692 --> 00:01:26.695
but now. I'm going to start
with you first.

31
00:01:26.695 --> 00:01:30.916
Unless you return me to
where I came from immediately.

32
00:01:30.916 --> 00:01:36.008
And clearly you have no idea
who you're dealing with...

33
00:01:36.008 --> 00:01:40.752
otherwise you'd know how
dangerous it is to threaten me.

34
00:01:40.752 --> 00:01:43.146
Like I care.

35
00:01:43.146 --> 00:01:44.408
'Cause you're about to bleed

36
00:01:44.408 --> 00:01:46.584
like everyone else
I've slaughtered.

37
00:01:46.584 --> 00:01:49.718
You got a few screws loose.

38
00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:50.893
I like that.

39
00:01:50.893 --> 00:01:52.112
You won't when I'm plucking

40
00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.201
those baby blues
out of your corpse.

41
00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:56.899
Now. tell me why I'm here!

42
00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.596
How the hell should I know?

43
00:01:58.596 --> 00:01:59.945
Last thing I remember.

44
00:01:59.945 --> 00:02:03.601
the Flash had just sicced
his Time Wraiths on me.

45
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:06.038
So that coward

46
00:02:06.038 --> 00:02:08.215
is responsible
for bringing us here?

47
00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:10.652
I highly doubt it.

48
00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:17.963
Welcome to the
Negative Speed Force. fellas.

49
00:02:17.963 --> 00:02:19.051
First time?

50
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:21.315
You're Harry Wells.

51
00:02:21.315 --> 00:02:23.317
You're the man who helped
the Flash defeat me.

52
00:02:23.317 --> 00:02:27.408
No. That's Thawne.

53
00:02:27.408 --> 00:02:29.410
The man who helped
the Flash defeat me.

54
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.412
Any last words. Thawne?

55
00:02:31.412 --> 00:02:35.807
Never wear white
after Labor Day.

56
00:02:35.807 --> 00:02:38.027
And Zoloman--

57
00:02:38.027 --> 00:02:39.463
Love your work.

58
00:02:39.463 --> 00:02:42.249
Although slightly derivative.
don't you think?

59
00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:45.077
Pretending to be
the Flash's ally.

60
00:02:45.077 --> 00:02:47.428
Let's see.
Who's playbook is that from?

61
00:02:47.428 --> 00:02:49.691
- Are you mocking me?
- Now. you're catching on.

62
00:02:49.691 --> 00:02:51.736
Good. Zoom.
- I'm the fastest man alive.

63
00:02:51.736 --> 00:02:56.437
No. you're a strung out.
jumped-up Velocity 9 junkie.

64
00:02:56.437 --> 00:03:00.267
The fastest man alive...

65
00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:02.312
You're looking at him.
- Oh. please.

66
00:03:02.312 --> 00:03:05.272
I'm the one. true god of speed.

67
00:03:06.142 --> 00:03:07.709
No. I am.

68
00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.277
Before I bring this dimension
to its knees.

69
00:03:10.277 --> 00:03:12.975
I demand to know
who brought us here.

70
00:03:12.975 --> 00:03:16.065
I did.

71
00:03:16.065 --> 00:03:18.328
What the hell?

72
00:03:18.328 --> 00:03:20.287
Boys. meet Eddie Thawne.

73
00:03:20.287 --> 00:03:24.029
the dumbest branch
on my family tree.

74
00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:25.466
Eddie Thawne.

75
00:03:25.466 --> 00:03:27.642
You're Team Flash's
old cop friend. right?

76
00:03:27.642 --> 00:03:29.034
Well. that's--that's real good.

77
00:03:29.034 --> 00:03:31.385
'cause I am great
at killing cops.

78
00:03:31.385 --> 00:03:34.779
That's real big talk
for a bunch of dead men.

79
00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:36.259
Liar.

80
00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:37.391
I'm invincible!

81
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:38.740
You sure about that?

82
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.133
- The Time Wraiths.
- That's right.

83
00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:43.484
You died. Hunter.

84
00:03:43.484 --> 00:03:46.574
So did you. Hart.
in the year 2052.

85
00:03:46.574 --> 00:03:48.793
Oh. you. too. Savitar.
- No.

86
00:03:48.793 --> 00:03:51.318
You all died.

87
00:03:51.318 --> 00:03:55.713
Turns out none of you
were powerful enough

88
00:03:55.713 --> 00:04:00.892
or fast enough
to defeat the Flash.

89
00:04:02.851 --> 00:04:04.896
But together...

90
00:04:04.896 --> 00:04:07.899
we can do what none of you
could do on your own.

91
00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:09.553
And tell me just how

92
00:04:09.553 --> 00:04:11.990
does a complete waste
of a human being like yourself

93
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.603
plan to defeat the Flash?

94
00:04:15.603 --> 00:04:17.300
Like this.

95
00:04:32.054 --> 00:04:33.447
You want more speed?

96
00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:35.318
I'll help you get it.

97
00:04:35.318 --> 00:04:40.367
Enough to kill the Flash.

98
00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:42.064
Now. who's in?

99
00:05:27.762 --> 00:05:29.198
Iris.

100
00:05:29.198 --> 00:05:31.243
Oh. my God. You're back.

101
00:05:31.243 --> 00:05:34.072
Are you okay?
How's the baby doing?

102
00:05:34.072 --> 00:05:35.900
The contractions are
about two minutes apart

103
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.295
and Dr. Lockett said that
I have about an hour.

104
00:05:39.295 --> 00:05:43.952
Iris. there's something
you need to know.

105
00:05:43.952 --> 00:05:47.042
The Negative Speed Force...

106
00:05:47.042 --> 00:05:48.913
it chose a new avatar.

107
00:05:48.913 --> 00:05:50.654
Who?

108
00:05:50.654 --> 00:05:53.962
I hope I'm not interrupting.

109
00:05:53.962 --> 00:05:56.051
Oh. my God. Eddie?

110
00:05:56.051 --> 00:05:58.096
It's Cobalt Blue now.

111
00:05:58.096 --> 00:06:00.925
Hey. Iris. Flash.

112
00:06:00.925 --> 00:06:02.274
Take another step
closer to her.

113
00:06:02.274 --> 00:06:05.277
Oh. no.
I'm not here to fight.

114
00:06:05.277 --> 00:06:08.106
I just came to say congrats.

115
00:06:08.106 --> 00:06:09.717
Eddie. how are you alive?

116
00:06:09.717 --> 00:06:12.067
The Negative Speed Force
brought him back.

117
00:06:12.067 --> 00:06:15.636
Turned him against us.
- It showed me the truth.

118
00:06:15.636 --> 00:06:20.467
And it gave me the power
to kill Barry

119
00:06:20.467 --> 00:06:23.731
and end his bloodline forever.

120
00:06:23.731 --> 00:06:28.300
Eddie. you kill me.
you kill the Speed Force too.

121
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.345
Exactly.

122
00:06:29.345 --> 00:06:30.825
And without the Speed Force

123
00:06:30.825 --> 00:06:34.655
to bind it together.
the timeline will fall.

124
00:06:34.655 --> 00:06:38.093
And then I'll make a new one
where I'm the hero.

125
00:06:38.093 --> 00:06:39.573
It's not personal.

126
00:06:39.573 --> 00:06:41.618
I just want my life back.

127
00:06:41.618 --> 00:06:43.707
The Negative Speed Force
is a dark force of nature.

128
00:06:43.707 --> 00:06:47.145
Why would it want to help you?
- It doesn't.

129
00:06:47.145 --> 00:06:48.756
It just wants to grow unchecked

130
00:06:48.756 --> 00:06:50.758
without the positive side
standing in its way.

131
00:06:50.758 --> 00:06:53.978
The negative side
saved my life.

132
00:06:53.978 --> 00:06:55.371
It wants me to win

133
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:56.981
and I'll be the one
with a family.

134
00:06:56.981 --> 00:06:59.288
This isn't you.
You're a good man.

135
00:06:59.288 --> 00:07:00.507
Let us help you.

136
00:07:00.507 --> 00:07:02.770
You could've helped me before.

137
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.295
Instead.
you looked the other way

138
00:07:06.295 --> 00:07:08.166
while I shot myself
in the chest.

139
00:07:08.166 --> 00:07:11.169
Now. any last words?

140
00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:13.868
I've got three.

141
00:07:13.868 --> 00:07:16.914
Run. Barry. Run.

142
00:07:47.728 --> 00:07:49.991
Eddie. please. Don't do this.

143
00:07:53.255 --> 00:07:54.822
Nora.

144
00:07:54.822 --> 00:07:58.086
When Grammy Cecile calls
from 25 years in the past.

145
00:07:58.086 --> 00:07:59.217
you answer.

146
00:08:09.271 --> 00:08:11.926
Looks like
the gang's all here.

147
00:08:11.926 --> 00:08:14.450
It's over.
You can't beat us all.

148
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.279
I don't have to.
You have your team.

149
00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:18.846
But me?

150
00:08:34.557 --> 00:08:36.994
I've got a whole legion.

151
00:08:53.489 --> 00:08:56.579
Flash. Flash. Flash.

152
00:08:56.579 --> 00:08:58.320
You didn't think
I was gonna miss

153
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.497
how this all turns out.
did you?

154
00:09:01.497 --> 00:09:03.717
We're going to slaughter
your team

155
00:09:03.717 --> 00:09:06.720
and end your legacy forever.

156
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.636
No. you won't.
and that's your only warning.

157
00:09:09.636 --> 00:09:11.812
Ooh. I like her.

158
00:09:11.812 --> 00:09:14.336
But seriously. you don't
stand a chance in hell.

159
00:09:14.336 --> 00:09:16.773
Tonight we change the future.

160
00:09:16.773 --> 00:09:20.255
Last chance to surrender. Flash.

161
00:09:20.255 --> 00:09:21.604
Execute Delta maneuvers.

162
00:09:52.766 --> 00:09:57.988
Your mother escaped her fate.
but you won't!

163
00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.526
Schway.

164
00:10:23.318 --> 00:10:25.581
Virtue!
Show yourself!

165
00:10:25.581 --> 00:10:27.714
<i>August. let me help you.</i>

166
00:10:27.714 --> 00:10:29.672
<i>I can feel how scared you are.</i>

167
00:10:29.672 --> 00:10:31.892
<i>Are you afraid
you can't beat me?</i>

168
00:10:31.892 --> 00:10:33.415
<i>Or that every time you kill.</i>

169
00:10:33.415 --> 00:10:35.417
<i>you lose another piece
of your soul?</i>

170
00:10:35.417 --> 00:10:37.158
You want a piece of my soul?

171
00:10:37.158 --> 00:10:39.334
How about a few dozen?

172
00:10:59.136 --> 00:11:03.663
So you beat my copies.
but I'm the real deal.

173
00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:07.754
The one. true god of speed.

174
00:11:17.459 --> 00:11:19.461
That's what I call
mind over matter.

175
00:11:22.116 --> 00:11:23.639
Now. that's how you do it.
people!

176
00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:25.641
Whoo!

177
00:11:25.641 --> 00:11:27.121
Hey.

178
00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.954
I love what you've done
with the place.

179
00:11:33.954 --> 00:11:35.564
We're gonna find a way
to stop you.

180
00:11:35.564 --> 00:11:37.435
Maybe.

181
00:11:40.438 --> 00:11:42.658
Maybe not.

182
00:11:42.658 --> 00:11:44.573
But either way...

183
00:11:49.143 --> 00:11:51.754
And just so you know...

184
00:11:51.754 --> 00:11:53.669
Just so you're aware
of the whole...

185
00:11:53.669 --> 00:11:57.629
"Timeline" of events here.

186
00:11:57.629 --> 00:12:00.850
after I kill you
I'm gonna kill your boss

187
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.330
because I don't care

188
00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.811
what any upgraded ancestor
of mine might say.

189
00:12:04.811 --> 00:12:07.901
Barry Allen's life is mine...

190
00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:10.817
to take...
and so is yours.

191
00:12:30.619 --> 00:12:32.229
Chuck!

192
00:12:32.229 --> 00:12:35.537
No. no. no.
It's okay. it's okay.

193
00:12:35.537 --> 00:12:38.279
Chuck. Chuck.

194
00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:40.237
No. no. no. no.

195
00:12:48.942 --> 00:12:52.641
Right on cue.
Khione called it.

196
00:12:52.641 --> 00:12:54.512
What now. Chief?

197
00:12:54.512 --> 00:12:55.862
Now. we get payback.

198
00:12:55.862 --> 00:12:57.994
Get your hands in the air.
Zoom!

199
00:12:57.994 --> 00:13:00.040
This is your only warning!

200
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.695
More of CCPD's finest
for me to slaughter. huh?

201
00:13:03.695 --> 00:13:04.827
You shouldn't have!

202
00:13:09.963 --> 00:13:12.400
I already told you. Hunter.

203
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.532
No one dies tonight.

204
00:13:14.532 --> 00:13:17.144
The goddess and her sidekick.

205
00:13:17.144 --> 00:13:20.321
Too bad neither of you
are powerful enough...

206
00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:24.455
To lock up the darkness.

207
00:13:31.419 --> 00:13:32.855
Everybody. down!

208
00:13:47.609 --> 00:13:50.394
Eddie. wait!

209
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.965
Isn't this sweet?

210
00:14:38.965 --> 00:14:44.318
Not only do I get to kill
your boyfriend...

211
00:14:45.972 --> 00:14:48.017
I get to kill you.

212
00:14:48.017 --> 00:14:53.675
wearing the face
of your old mentor. Nash.

213
00:14:53.675 --> 00:14:57.679
Thawne...

214
00:14:57.679 --> 00:14:59.637
Stop talking!

215
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:16.959
Chuck.
Wake up. wake up. Chuck!

216
00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:20.267
No. no. no. no.
Wake up. Chuck.

217
00:15:20.267 --> 00:15:22.530
Chuck.

218
00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:26.186
No. Please. Wake up.

219
00:15:26.186 --> 00:15:28.362
Please. please. please.

220
00:15:28.362 --> 00:15:31.452
No!

221
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.684
Chuck.

222
00:15:48.208 --> 00:15:49.557
Chuck.

223
00:15:49.557 --> 00:15:51.602
Chuck.

224
00:15:51.602 --> 00:15:54.257
You came back to me.

225
00:15:54.257 --> 00:15:55.737
Always.

226
00:16:19.456 --> 00:16:21.371
I don't want to hurt them. Flash.

227
00:16:21.371 --> 00:16:26.986
And I won't if you surrender
and let me kill you.

228
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:43.176
No. You stole my speed.

229
00:16:43.176 --> 00:16:44.916
Just another trick
I picked up

230
00:16:44.916 --> 00:16:48.746
from my Earth-90 doppelganger.

231
00:16:48.746 --> 00:16:51.619
I'd stay down if I were you.

232
00:16:51.619 --> 00:16:53.447
Hey there. kid.

233
00:16:53.447 --> 00:16:54.709
Great timing.

234
00:16:54.709 --> 00:16:57.059
I won't let it end like this.

235
00:16:57.059 --> 00:17:00.541
I--I just need more speed.

236
00:17:24.652 --> 00:17:26.349
Eddie. stop.

237
00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:30.092
Not until
I'm the fastest man alive.

238
00:17:30.092 --> 00:17:32.790
Then I'll be the hero. Flash!

239
00:17:47.849 --> 00:17:51.983
- My God. that lightning.
- It's temporal fracturing.

240
00:17:51.983 --> 00:17:53.463
The whole timeline's
unraveling.

241
00:17:53.463 --> 00:17:54.943
Flash...

242
00:17:54.943 --> 00:17:57.989
If Eddie wants more speed.
he'll go to the source.

243
00:17:57.989 --> 00:18:00.470
The Negative Speed Force.

244
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.777
But if he keeps absorbing it...

245
00:18:02.777 --> 00:18:06.998
He'll overload
and kill himself.

246
00:18:06.998 --> 00:18:09.044
Just like Thawne.

247
00:18:18.401 --> 00:18:19.576
There's lightning
all over the city.

248
00:18:19.576 --> 00:18:20.969
Does that mean...

249
00:18:20.969 --> 00:18:22.231
The whole timeline's
breaking down.

250
00:18:22.231 --> 00:18:23.841
How do we stop Eddie?

251
00:18:23.841 --> 00:18:25.930
Now. that he's the
Negative Speed Force avatar.

252
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:29.020
the only way to defeat him is
to let it destroy himself.

253
00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:30.283
Just like that last one.

254
00:18:30.283 --> 00:18:31.675
Okay. so let's do that.

255
00:18:31.675 --> 00:18:33.373
Eddie's a hero.

256
00:18:33.373 --> 00:18:35.331
He saved my life once
by sacrificing himself

257
00:18:35.331 --> 00:18:37.072
to stop Thawne--
I won't let him die again.

258
00:18:37.072 --> 00:18:39.509
I need to find a way into the
Negative Speed Force somehow.

259
00:18:39.509 --> 00:18:41.337
Uh. I think maybe
saving the universe

260
00:18:41.337 --> 00:18:43.209
is a lot more important
than just one guy.

261
00:18:43.209 --> 00:18:44.732
My wife is in the hospital

262
00:18:44.732 --> 00:18:46.603
right now about to give birth
to our child!

263
00:18:46.603 --> 00:18:48.953
I am trying to save
the timeline <i>and</i> Eddie's life!

264
00:18:48.953 --> 00:18:54.742
Son. as hard as it sounds.
that may just be impossible.

265
00:18:56.831 --> 00:18:58.659
It can't be.

266
00:18:58.659 --> 00:19:01.314
I can get you into
the Negative Speed Force.

267
00:19:01.314 --> 00:19:05.056
but what will you do
once you're there?

268
00:19:05.056 --> 00:19:06.841
Stop Eddie from
killing himself.

269
00:19:06.841 --> 00:19:09.931
But that won't work because
they'll just pick a new avatar.

270
00:19:09.931 --> 00:19:11.280
Then what am
I supposed to do?

271
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.890
You need to change
his point of view.

272
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:14.283
How?

273
00:19:14.283 --> 00:19:15.937
The negative forces
are at war with us.

274
00:19:15.937 --> 00:19:17.243
They always will be.

275
00:19:17.243 --> 00:19:19.070
They push. we push back.

276
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.203
We get stronger. so do they.

277
00:19:21.203 --> 00:19:23.640
That's what balance means.

278
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.774
It sounds like a never-ending
cycle of violence and death.

279
00:19:26.774 --> 00:19:29.124
You think I don't know that?

280
00:19:29.124 --> 00:19:32.388
Khione. for the last nine years

281
00:19:32.388 --> 00:19:37.567
I have watched the people
I love suffer and die.

282
00:19:37.567 --> 00:19:42.833
I want a better world
for my family. for everyone.

283
00:19:42.833 --> 00:19:45.053
But I don't know how to do it.

284
00:19:45.053 --> 00:19:48.317
What if there's
another way forward?

285
00:19:48.317 --> 00:19:51.451
The more I embrace
who I truly am.

286
00:19:51.451 --> 00:19:54.889
the more I see the natural
order of things.

287
00:19:54.889 --> 00:19:59.198
You say balance
is about violence and death.

288
00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:01.417
but it doesn't
have to be that way.

289
00:20:01.417 --> 00:20:05.421
Nature is about more
than balance.

290
00:20:05.421 --> 00:20:08.294
It's about coexistence.

291
00:20:08.294 --> 00:20:10.470
All things living together.

292
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:15.083
Not in conflict.
but in mutual trust.

293
00:20:15.083 --> 00:20:18.782
Khione. the last avatar
I faced...

294
00:20:18.782 --> 00:20:21.176
I sat down.

295
00:20:21.176 --> 00:20:24.788
I stopped fighting.

296
00:20:24.788 --> 00:20:26.964
Thawne didn't.

297
00:20:26.964 --> 00:20:29.706
You want coexistence.

298
00:20:29.706 --> 00:20:31.708
but I'm sorry.

299
00:20:31.708 --> 00:20:34.494
It's impossible.

300
00:20:34.494 --> 00:20:38.672
Then you need to believe
in the impossible

301
00:20:38.672 --> 00:20:42.632
because it's the only way
to create a better world.

302
00:21:10.791 --> 00:21:12.183
Eddie!

303
00:21:21.367 --> 00:21:22.846
What have you done?

304
00:21:22.846 --> 00:21:24.457
Your connection
to the Negative Speed Force

305
00:21:24.457 --> 00:21:25.806
is gonna kill you--
You have to let it go.

306
00:21:25.806 --> 00:21:27.851
Liar!

307
00:21:31.115 --> 00:21:32.334
You just want it all
for yourself.

308
00:21:32.334 --> 00:21:33.727
I want to save you!

309
00:21:33.727 --> 00:21:35.772
All that power
is overloading your body.

310
00:21:35.772 --> 00:21:38.384
You can't survive it.
- Shut up!

311
00:21:42.213 --> 00:21:45.042
You stole my life!

312
00:21:47.131 --> 00:21:48.611
I hate you!

313
00:21:48.611 --> 00:21:50.221
I'm not gonna fight you anymore.

314
00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:03.757
You didn't stop Thawne.
I did.

315
00:22:03.757 --> 00:22:07.282
I saved everyone.
You know why?

316
00:22:07.282 --> 00:22:11.547
Because I always win. Flash.

317
00:22:11.547 --> 00:22:13.854
I always win. Flash.

318
00:22:13.854 --> 00:22:15.464
Always!

319
00:22:31.741 --> 00:22:34.788
Don't you see
what's happening?

320
00:22:34.788 --> 00:22:38.357
You've become the person
you died trying to stop.

321
00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:39.967
He lies!

322
00:22:39.967 --> 00:22:41.403
Iris isn't your wife.

323
00:22:41.403 --> 00:22:43.362
<i>Kill him now!
Take back what's yours.</i>

324
00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:44.754
- I love you.
- Eddie.

325
00:22:44.754 --> 00:22:46.800
<i>You hold the power now.
Use it!</i>

326
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.455
<i>End Barry Allen's
pathetic existence!</i>

327
00:22:49.455 --> 00:22:50.934
You have to remain
as the avatar.

328
00:22:50.934 --> 00:22:52.893
<i>Remember what
he stole from you!</i>

329
00:22:52.893 --> 00:22:54.373
You are the answer!

330
00:22:54.373 --> 00:22:55.722
Thawne gave into hate.
but you can fight it.

331
00:22:55.722 --> 00:22:57.463
<i>It can still be yours.
All of it!</i>

332
00:22:57.463 --> 00:22:58.638
<i>It's what you deserve.</i>

333
00:23:00.466 --> 00:23:02.076
That's how we'll create
a better world.

334
00:23:02.076 --> 00:23:03.599
Both sides working together.

335
00:23:03.599 --> 00:23:04.818
Now!
Kill him!

336
00:23:04.818 --> 00:23:08.169
No! Eddie!

337
00:23:08.169 --> 00:23:11.259
That's all
I ever wanted to be.

338
00:23:11.259 --> 00:23:13.043
Your hero.

339
00:23:55.695 --> 00:23:59.176
From one avatar to another.

340
00:23:59.176 --> 00:24:01.570
Just because I'm doing this.

341
00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:06.532
doesn't mean we'll always
see eye-to-eye.

342
00:24:06.532 --> 00:24:10.710
We're still on opposite sides.

343
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:13.408
I know.

344
00:24:13.408 --> 00:24:17.020
Together. we'll find a way.

345
00:24:25.899 --> 00:24:28.945
Tell Iris...

346
00:24:28.945 --> 00:24:30.207
I'm happy for her.

347
00:24:49.575 --> 00:24:51.402
- Iris.
- Hey.

348
00:24:51.402 --> 00:24:53.535
Well. Daddy.
you're just in time.

349
00:24:53.535 --> 00:24:55.494
- Really?
- Nora's coming.

350
00:24:55.494 --> 00:24:58.540
Okay. All right.

351
00:25:07.157 --> 00:25:08.855
Guys. Jay's confirmed it.

352
00:25:08.855 --> 00:25:10.944
The red lightning is gone.
The timeline is back to normal.

353
00:25:10.944 --> 00:25:12.467
Which means
the whole "legion of Zoom"

354
00:25:12.467 --> 00:25:13.773
is right back where
they belong too.

355
00:25:13.773 --> 00:25:16.602
And Barry has once again
saved the world.

356
00:25:16.602 --> 00:25:19.430
- How are you feeling. Chuck?
- Hungry.

357
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.868
But also. totally...

358
00:25:21.868 --> 00:25:22.956
normal!

359
00:25:22.956 --> 00:25:25.349
Normal. normal.

360
00:25:25.349 --> 00:25:26.786
You're good.

361
00:25:26.786 --> 00:25:28.178
Despite being hit
by enough electricity

362
00:25:28.178 --> 00:25:30.398
to kill an entire circus
full of elephants.

363
00:25:30.398 --> 00:25:32.400
Runk here doesn't have
a scratch on him.

364
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.619
And I think I know why.

365
00:25:33.619 --> 00:25:35.272
Buddy. your blood

366
00:25:35.272 --> 00:25:37.710
is generating Hawking radiation
at a molecular level.

367
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:39.059
But that's
the same kind of energy

368
00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:40.626
that you find
inside of black holes.

369
00:25:40.626 --> 00:25:42.323
So I think that
back in the day.

370
00:25:42.323 --> 00:25:44.630
when your consciousness
bonded with that black hole...

371
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:46.457
What up. party people?

372
00:25:46.457 --> 00:25:49.460
Some of that cosmic energy
bonded right back with you.

373
00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:53.290
Okay are you saying
that I have black hole powers?

374
00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.510
Like I'm a meta?

375
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.425
Technically.
your genes do contain

376
00:25:57.425 --> 00:25:58.818
a Consciousness-Honed

377
00:25:58.818 --> 00:26:00.210
Universally Neutralized
Kerr anomaly.

378
00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:02.996
Hold on.
I'm a C-H-U-N-K?

379
00:26:02.996 --> 00:26:04.345
Psh.

380
00:26:04.345 --> 00:26:06.695
I'm a CHUNK. baby!
I'm a CHUNK!

381
00:26:06.695 --> 00:26:09.480
♪ C-H-U-N-K ♪

382
00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.092

Wait. does this mean I'm gonna
be a superhero now?

384
00:26:14.616 --> 00:26:17.663
Guys. we got to go.
Baby's coming.

385
00:26:17.663 --> 00:26:19.447
Baby's coming.

386
00:26:26.672 --> 00:26:28.021
How about now?

387
00:26:28.021 --> 00:26:29.196
Your powers picking up
our grandbaby?

388
00:26:29.196 --> 00:26:30.980
No. baby.

389
00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.026
not since the last time you
asked me like 30 seconds ago.

390
00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.464
Hey. at least
she's not giving birth

391
00:26:36.464 --> 00:26:38.684
while the Thinker is trying
to take over the city.

392
00:26:38.684 --> 00:26:40.686
- That was a hell of a night.
- Yup.

393
00:26:40.686 --> 00:26:42.470
Well. today is
pretty weird too.

394
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:46.169
I mean. I'm about to be born on
the other side of that wall.

395
00:26:47.344 --> 00:26:49.303
Shrap.

396
00:26:49.303 --> 00:26:51.522
Am I breaking timeline rules
by being here?

397
00:26:51.522 --> 00:26:53.046
You--a little--

398
00:26:53.046 --> 00:26:55.004
I wasn't gonna say much.
but it's fine.

399
00:26:55.004 --> 00:26:57.703
- You're fine.
- We fixed it theoretically.

400
00:26:57.703 --> 00:26:59.095
You're fine.

401
00:27:01.402 --> 00:27:03.404
Hello. there.

402
00:27:06.189 --> 00:27:09.758
You're a Wells.
It's nice to meet you.

403
00:27:09.758 --> 00:27:12.065
It's nice to meet you.

404
00:27:12.065 --> 00:27:14.110
Did you travel
across the cosmos

405
00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:17.374
just to be here
for Barry and Iris?

406
00:27:17.374 --> 00:27:20.856
Not just them.

407
00:27:20.856 --> 00:27:23.642
The Negative Speed Force's
threat...

408
00:27:23.642 --> 00:27:26.122
it's gone.

409
00:27:26.122 --> 00:27:31.127
And so it's time for you
to ascend...

410
00:27:31.127 --> 00:27:33.260
become the natural order's
protector of all things.

411
00:27:37.699 --> 00:27:40.049
I have to say goodbye
to my family.

412
00:27:40.049 --> 00:27:41.834
I know that's
the way of nature.

413
00:27:41.834 --> 00:27:44.575
Fall becomes winter.
Winter becomes spring. but...

414
00:27:44.575 --> 00:27:47.187
But saying good bye is hard.

415
00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:53.628
Even for a time traveler.

416
00:27:53.628 --> 00:27:57.110
It's not the time travel
that matters.

417
00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:01.114
What matters is
carrying a piece

418
00:28:01.114 --> 00:28:05.858
of the ones you love wherever...

419
00:28:05.858 --> 00:28:08.512
and whenever you go.

420
00:28:15.215 --> 00:28:17.696
That's it. Iris.
You got this.

421
00:28:26.487 --> 00:28:30.926
Oh. congratulations.

422
00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:38.325
Oh. my God.
she's so beautiful.

423
00:28:38.325 --> 00:28:41.284
Oh!

424
00:28:44.635 --> 00:28:47.377
Hi. Nora.

425
00:28:47.377 --> 00:28:49.466
Nice to finally meet you.

426
00:29:22.804 --> 00:29:25.502
I remember when you were
this small.

427
00:29:25.502 --> 00:29:27.374
Holding you for the first time.

428
00:29:27.374 --> 00:29:30.377
Bringing you home.

429
00:29:30.377 --> 00:29:32.205
Now. look at you.

430
00:29:32.205 --> 00:29:35.599
I'm a granddad
and you're a mom.

431
00:29:40.082 --> 00:29:43.564
You're not my baby girl anymore.

432
00:29:43.564 --> 00:29:45.784
Yes. I am. Dad.

433
00:29:45.784 --> 00:29:48.961
I always will be.

434
00:29:48.961 --> 00:29:51.093
Oh.

435
00:29:51.093 --> 00:29:52.399
Oh. here. I'll take her.

436
00:29:52.399 --> 00:29:54.444

I can't believe
you're leaving us.

453
00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.336
It feels like just yesterday

454
00:31:00.336 --> 00:31:02.121
you were comparing me
to a daffodil seed.

455
00:31:02.121 --> 00:31:05.037
And look how
you've blossomed.

456
00:31:05.037 --> 00:31:07.953
Hey. I will take care of
Kesha. Bob. Laverne.

457
00:31:07.953 --> 00:31:10.303
Kalil. Jean-Paul. all of them.
I promise.

458
00:31:10.303 --> 00:31:12.871
And I am sure they will be
excellent companions to you

459
00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:14.002
just as they were to me.

460
00:31:19.138 --> 00:31:21.488
Khione. if it wasn't
for you last week--

461
00:31:21.488 --> 00:31:22.837
I did the same thing

462
00:31:22.837 --> 00:31:24.534
any member of Team Flash
would have done.

463
00:31:24.534 --> 00:31:27.624
And being a part
of everything you've built

464
00:31:27.624 --> 00:31:30.149
over the last nine years.

465
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:32.586
it's been the honor
of a lifetime.

466
00:31:41.421 --> 00:31:44.424
You're family now. Khione.
You take care of yourself.

467
00:31:44.424 --> 00:31:46.556
I will.

468
00:31:53.563 --> 00:31:55.000
Thank you.

469
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.698
Thank you for never
giving up on me.

470
00:31:57.698 --> 00:31:58.960
Of course.

471
00:32:05.532 --> 00:32:07.751
So where you gonna go?

472
00:32:07.751 --> 00:32:10.145
Once I truly embraced
my powers.

473
00:32:10.145 --> 00:32:12.017
I realized something.

474
00:32:12.017 --> 00:32:14.410
Nothing ever dies.
We're all connected.

475
00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:19.372
We rise from dirt
and we return to dirt.

476
00:32:19.372 --> 00:32:22.157
And that's the natural
order of things...

477
00:32:22.157 --> 00:32:25.508
what I was born to protect.

478
00:32:25.508 --> 00:32:29.643
But now. my time
in this mortal body is done.

479
00:32:29.643 --> 00:32:32.167
I'm really gonna miss you.

480
00:32:32.167 --> 00:32:33.821
Keep flourishing.

481
00:32:36.911 --> 00:32:40.480
Remember.
I will always be with you.

482
00:33:18.431 --> 00:33:21.303
Oh. my God.

483
00:33:21.303 --> 00:33:23.566
Caitlin?

484
00:33:23.566 --> 00:33:25.786
Hi. guys.

485
00:33:25.786 --> 00:33:27.135
How?

486
00:33:27.135 --> 00:33:28.615
When Khione ascended.

487
00:33:28.615 --> 00:33:30.660
she didn't need
her physical body anymore.

488
00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.967
So she used her gifts
to return Caitlin

489
00:33:32.967 --> 00:33:35.665
to her rightful place.
- With her family.

490
00:33:39.495 --> 00:33:41.149
I never thought
I'd see you again.

491
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:45.675
I know. but I'm home again.

00:34:37.162 --> 00:34:41.688
I promise I'll come by
Tannhauser as soon as I can.

502
00:34:41.688 --> 00:34:44.734
I love you too. Mom.

503
00:34:44.734 --> 00:34:46.649
No matter how many times
I tell her I'm fine.

504
00:34:46.649 --> 00:34:48.434
Carla still wants to run
more tests.

505
00:34:48.434 --> 00:34:50.000
Sounds like
somebody's anxious

506
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.177
to get back to
Team Flash full time.

507
00:34:52.177 --> 00:34:56.659
It's good.
I really missed you.

508
00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:57.747
We all did.

509
00:35:01.447 --> 00:35:04.711
Um. Caitlin...

510
00:35:04.711 --> 00:35:09.194
about how we left things...

511
00:35:09.194 --> 00:35:12.545
I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

512
00:35:12.545 --> 00:35:15.243
What you did. it showed me that

513
00:35:15.243 --> 00:35:19.117
Frost's love. her legacy...

514
00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:22.120
I'll carry that with me always.

515
00:35:23.643 --> 00:35:26.689
What I was doing trying
to bring Frost back

516
00:35:26.689 --> 00:35:29.692
was just... unnatural.

517
00:35:31.738 --> 00:35:34.044
Khione really
rubbed off on you. huh?

518
00:35:34.044 --> 00:35:35.524
Maybe I should
die my hair blue.

519
00:35:39.093 --> 00:35:41.269
Come meet Nora.
- I can't wait.

520
00:35:43.402 --> 00:35:44.968
Hi.

521
00:35:54.195 --> 00:35:58.243
That's a good. little me.

522
00:35:58.243 --> 00:36:00.419
Okay. even for us.
this is trippy.

523
00:36:00.419 --> 00:36:04.031
I know. Well.
I'm just glad you're here.

524
00:36:04.031 --> 00:36:06.076
Both of you.

525
00:36:06.076 --> 00:36:08.731
It's been pretty wild lately.

526
00:36:08.731 --> 00:36:12.692
You think it was a crazy
24 hours before I was born?

527
00:36:12.692 --> 00:36:13.954
Wait for Bart's due date.

528
00:36:17.087 --> 00:36:18.088
Great.

529
00:36:20.134 --> 00:36:22.615
Aw. they love me.

530
00:36:27.968 --> 00:36:29.404
Hey. hey.

531
00:36:30.492 --> 00:36:32.146
Ooh!

532
00:36:33.713 --> 00:36:37.195
Whoo.

533
00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:39.327
This has been a hell of a week.

534
00:36:39.327 --> 00:36:42.374
Not only did I become
a grandpa.

535
00:36:42.374 --> 00:36:47.335
our new mother here gave birth
to a healthy baby girl.

536
00:36:47.335 --> 00:36:51.774
And she won her first
Pulitzer too.

537
00:36:55.038 --> 00:36:57.084
That's two special ladies
in my life.

538
00:36:57.084 --> 00:37:01.131
but so the mother
of my third special lady

539
00:37:01.131 --> 00:37:03.133
doesn't feel left out--
Cecile?

540
00:37:03.133 --> 00:37:05.135
Oh. Well.

541
00:37:07.007 --> 00:37:10.837
Babe.
over the last few years.

542
00:37:10.837 --> 00:37:16.059
I have watched you take on
a second career.

543
00:37:16.059 --> 00:37:20.455
become a superhero.

544
00:37:20.455 --> 00:37:23.980
and be the best mother

545
00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:27.375
Jenna could ever have.

546
00:37:27.375 --> 00:37:32.293
And I know that wherever
our dreams may take us.

547
00:37:32.293 --> 00:37:38.995
we will always
keep loving each other.

548
00:37:38.995 --> 00:37:44.044
Which is why now...

549
00:37:44.044 --> 00:37:45.698
I would like to do this.

550
00:37:51.704 --> 00:37:52.966
Joe. oh. my God.

551
00:37:52.966 --> 00:37:55.055
Are you--are you about
to do what I think...

552
00:37:55.055 --> 00:37:59.277
- Mm-hmm.
- Wait. Wait.

553
00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:11.158
Cecile Horton.

554
00:38:11.158 --> 00:38:15.205
Mm-hmm?

555
00:38:18.905 --> 00:38:23.475
Will you marry me?

556
00:38:23.475 --> 00:38:24.737
Yes.

557
00:38:24.737 --> 00:38:26.869
I mean. finally.
Am I right?

558
00:38:57.335 --> 00:38:59.946
It's okay.
I got her.

559
00:38:59.946 --> 00:39:02.035
I think she likes
the sound of your voice.

560
00:39:02.035 --> 00:39:03.558
Maybe try talking to her.

561
00:39:06.082 --> 00:39:08.955
Hey.

562
00:39:08.955 --> 00:39:12.132
You want to hear a story?

563
00:39:12.132 --> 00:39:13.438
Okay. but before I start.

564
00:39:13.438 --> 00:39:16.049
I need you
to do something first.

565
00:39:16.049 --> 00:39:19.661
I need you to stop crying.

566
00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:31.020
And I need you to believe
in the impossible.

567
00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.066
Can you do that?

568
00:39:35.677 --> 00:39:38.854
Good.

569
00:39:38.854 --> 00:39:43.293
Your dad is fast.

570
00:39:43.293 --> 00:39:46.471
Faster than the speed of sound.

571
00:39:46.471 --> 00:39:49.125
And the faster I go.

572
00:39:49.125 --> 00:39:52.128
the more the world slows down.

573
00:39:52.128 --> 00:39:55.393
But it wasn't always easy.

574
00:39:55.393 --> 00:39:57.438
When I was a kid.

575
00:39:57.438 --> 00:40:02.225
I lost the people
I cared about most.

576
00:40:02.225 --> 00:40:06.099
I won't let that happen to you.

577
00:40:06.099 --> 00:40:08.841
That's why your mom and I.

578
00:40:08.841 --> 00:40:12.322
we need to do something impossible.

579
00:40:14.368 --> 00:40:18.459
<i>Our family has been blessed
with these amazing gifts.</i>

580
00:40:18.459 --> 00:40:21.201
<i>Maybe that speed shouldn't
just belong to us anymore.</i>

581
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:28.034
<i>My friend Oliver said that
the lightning chose me.</i>

582
00:40:28.034 --> 00:40:33.561
<i>Well. now.
I'm gonna do the choosing.</i>

583
00:40:33.561 --> 00:40:37.739
<i>My name's Barry Allen.
but their names...</i>

584
00:40:37.739 --> 00:40:40.263
I just had some car trouble
this morning.

585
00:40:42.048 --> 00:40:44.050
No. I don't own a car.

586
00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.356
Yeah. I will be right there.
<i>- Are Avery Ho...</i>

587
00:40:48.663 --> 00:40:52.145
Time to go home.

588
00:40:52.145 --> 00:40:53.363
<i>Max Mercury...</i>

589
00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.546
Maybe not.

590
00:41:04.374 --> 00:41:05.985
<i>Jess Chambers...</i>

591
00:41:13.035 --> 00:41:15.168
Cool.

592
00:41:15.168 --> 00:41:19.041
<i>Maybe if we share a piece
of ourselves.</i>

593
00:41:19.041 --> 00:41:23.742
<i>we can break out of our old
cycles of violence and pain.</i>

594
00:41:23.742 --> 00:41:27.310
Create a new world for you. Nora.

595
00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:29.399
A better one.

596
00:41:33.403 --> 00:41:37.103
<i>One where we can coexist.</i>

597
00:41:37.103 --> 00:41:38.974
<i>All of us.</i>

598
00:41:40.933 --> 00:41:43.109
<i>Together.</i>

599
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:47.026
<i>A world where nothing
has to be impossible...</i>

600
00:41:49.202 --> 00:41:52.118
<i>As long as we believe in it.</i>

601
00:42:17.622 --> 00:42:18.797
Greg. move your head.
