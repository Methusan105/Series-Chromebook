5

That'll teach you for betting
against my Knights. Doctor.

6
00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:23.213
Well. I'm a die-hard
Sharks fan.

7
00:01:23.213 --> 00:01:25.346
Some folks never learn.

8
00:01:25.346 --> 00:01:27.130
Anyways. thanks for the coffee.

9
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.436
Sure.

10
00:01:28.436 --> 00:01:30.264
Also. I think I left my...

11
00:01:30.264 --> 00:01:32.744
ID badge?

12
00:01:32.744 --> 00:01:34.790
Cleaning crew found it
inside the elevator.

13
00:01:36.792 --> 00:01:38.446
Thanks.

14
00:01:38.446 --> 00:01:40.361
Been looking for it
all morning.

15
00:02:16.614 --> 00:02:18.312
So...

16
00:02:18.312 --> 00:02:19.617
how's it fit?

17
00:02:19.617 --> 00:02:20.966
Uh...

18
00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:23.882
perfectly. I guess.

19
00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:33.327
I feel like Rainbow Brite.

20
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.155
Okay. Okay. yeah.

21
00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.286
No. I see that. I see that.

22
00:02:36.286 --> 00:02:37.853
But I just figured. you know.

23
00:02:37.853 --> 00:02:39.463
since you can control
all the wavelengths

24
00:02:39.463 --> 00:02:41.204
in the spectrum.
why not have

25
00:02:41.204 --> 00:02:43.380
the groovy threads to match. right?

26
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.559
Oh. my God. You hate it.

27
00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:50.735
Yes. and--and I'm sorry.

28
00:02:50.735 --> 00:02:54.130
'cause I know
how hard you worked on this

29
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.176
and that you're just trying
to protect my identity.

30
00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:58.134
which I really appreciate.

31
00:02:58.134 --> 00:03:00.789
How about just the mask?

32
00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:02.660
Chuck.
I just want to be myself

33
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.315
and feel comfortable doing it.

34
00:03:05.315 --> 00:03:07.926
Yeah.

35
00:03:07.926 --> 00:03:10.929
And I--I just...

36
00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:12.931
I just want you to be happy.

37
00:03:14.498 --> 00:03:17.022
So go on. give it back.

38
00:03:17.022 --> 00:03:21.984
I'll find a way to recycle
these materials somehow.

39
00:03:24.813 --> 00:03:27.555
You know. um.
Cecile is away

40
00:03:27.555 --> 00:03:28.817
with Joe and Jenna.

41
00:03:28.817 --> 00:03:30.471
Mm-hmm.

42
00:03:30.471 --> 00:03:31.907
Do you want to come over
to the house

43
00:03:31.907 --> 00:03:33.735
and help me take this off?

44
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:40.959
Yeah.

45
00:03:49.446 --> 00:03:51.100
Yams are ready!

46
00:03:52.797 --> 00:03:55.147
Babe. you know
you do not have to make

47
00:03:55.147 --> 00:03:56.888
an entire feast for me

48
00:03:56.888 --> 00:03:59.064
every time I come home
for the weekend.

49
00:03:59.064 --> 00:04:00.849
I don't have to.
but I want to.

50
00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.330
Oh. I mean. if you want to.

51
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.592
If you insist.

52
00:04:07.725 --> 00:04:10.641
It feels so good to be home.

53
00:04:10.641 --> 00:04:13.296
Oh. new place ain't so bad.

54
00:04:13.296 --> 00:04:15.255
No. it's not about that.

55
00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.387
It's not about the place.

56
00:04:17.387 --> 00:04:18.954
It's you.

57
00:04:18.954 --> 00:04:20.825
It's you and Jenna.

58
00:04:20.825 --> 00:04:22.479
You're my home.

59
00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.309
And these weekends.
they mean everything.

60
00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:28.572
In that case.
maybe you want to hang

61
00:04:28.572 --> 00:04:30.052
a little longer.

62
00:04:30.052 --> 00:04:31.967
maybe go to the office late
on Monday?

63
00:04:31.967 --> 00:04:35.187
Mm. is that why
I'm sensing you

64
00:04:35.187 --> 00:04:37.102
singing the blues inside?

65
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.977
Hey.

66
00:04:41.977 --> 00:04:45.241
I am so proud of the hero
you've become.

67
00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:47.330
This place that we've built
out here--

68
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.810
honestly. I feel like

69
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.986
I'm the luckiest person
in the world.

70
00:04:50.986 --> 00:04:52.640
We both are.

71
00:04:55.425 --> 00:04:57.122
Mm.

72
00:04:57.122 --> 00:04:58.472
I'm gonna go get
our little munchkin.

73
00:04:58.472 --> 00:05:00.212
- Mm.
- Jenna!

74
00:05:00.212 --> 00:05:02.911
It's lunchtime. sweetie!

75
00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:47.869
Hello. Laverne.

76
00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:50.219
Kalil. Jean-Paul.

77
00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:51.873
everyone else.

78
00:06:02.971 --> 00:06:05.321
Dear sisters
Caitlin and Frost...

79
00:06:05.321 --> 00:06:08.280
<i>you won't believe
what happened today.</i>

80
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.413
<i>The journey I've been on
for the last nine months</i>

81
00:06:10.413 --> 00:06:13.198
<i>keeps bearing fruit
in wonderful ways.</i>

82
00:06:13.198 --> 00:06:16.201
<i>Like this morning.
I refroze lake Whittier</i>

83
00:06:16.201 --> 00:06:19.291
<i>for a group of schoolkids
on an ice skating trip.</i>

84
00:06:19.291 --> 00:06:22.077
<i>Frost. I know
you'd have done the same.</i>

85
00:06:22.077 --> 00:06:23.992
<i>And Caitlin.
A.R.G.U.S. has been helping me</i>

86
00:06:23.992 --> 00:06:26.516
<i>catalog my new powers.
which is good.</i>

87
00:06:26.516 --> 00:06:30.085
<i>because every day.
another new ability crops up.</i>

88
00:06:30.085 --> 00:06:31.695
<i>There's just one person</i>

89
00:06:31.695 --> 00:06:35.003
<i>I wish I could talk to
about all this.</i>

90
00:06:35.003 --> 00:06:40.269
So wherever you are. Mark.
I hope you're okay.

91
00:06:48.538 --> 00:06:51.149
Since when do you do things
last-minute?

92
00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:52.673
I thought you'd be happy.

93
00:06:52.673 --> 00:06:53.804
I'm just--I'm trying to live
in the moment.

94
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.895
Well. speaking of.

95
00:06:57.895 --> 00:07:00.463
can I please give birth
right now?

96
00:07:00.463 --> 00:07:03.727
Seriously. I am so ready
to drink wine again.

97
00:07:03.727 --> 00:07:05.076
Any day now.

98
00:07:05.076 --> 00:07:07.122
You got this.

99
00:07:07.122 --> 00:07:09.777
So what's up
with the tiny tech?

100
00:07:09.777 --> 00:07:11.735
I'm baby-proofing the loft

101
00:07:11.735 --> 00:07:14.564
with proximity-based
meta dampeners.

102
00:07:14.564 --> 00:07:16.131
You're dampening our kid?

103
00:07:16.131 --> 00:07:17.828
I just--you know.
what if Nora

104
00:07:17.828 --> 00:07:20.701
accidentally uses her speed
and gets hurt?

105
00:07:20.701 --> 00:07:22.746
Oh. yeah.

106
00:07:22.746 --> 00:07:23.791
Oh. God.

107
00:07:23.791 --> 00:07:25.053
My back is killing me.

108
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.186
Oh. my gosh.
- What?

109
00:07:28.186 --> 00:07:30.058
My article.
"Nightmare Under Red Skies."

110
00:07:30.058 --> 00:07:31.842
has been nominated
for a Pulitzer.

111
00:07:31.842 --> 00:07:33.496
- It happened?
- Yeah.

112
00:07:33.496 --> 00:07:35.629
Iris...

113
00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:37.892
I'm so proud of you.

114
00:07:37.892 --> 00:07:39.502
And remember.

115
00:07:39.502 --> 00:07:40.721
even though
we knew this was coming.

116
00:07:40.721 --> 00:07:42.244
you earned this.

117
00:07:42.244 --> 00:07:43.985
- I'm gonna call my dad.
- All right.

118
00:07:43.985 --> 00:07:46.335
I'm gonna finish
installing these.

119
00:07:46.335 --> 00:07:47.902
Ahh! Ah!
- What is it?

120
00:07:47.902 --> 00:07:49.817
I don't know. I--

121
00:07:49.817 --> 00:07:51.514
Barry!

122
00:07:53.603 --> 00:07:54.996
Ahh!

123
00:08:02.046 --> 00:08:03.265
No...

124
00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.815
2000.

125
00:08:31.815 --> 00:08:34.165
What did I do this time?

126
00:08:46.482 --> 00:08:47.788
Time to go home.

127
00:09:05.501 --> 00:09:07.068
How the hell
do I get out of here now?

128
00:09:16.643 --> 00:09:18.383
Yeah.

129
00:09:44.627 --> 00:09:45.846
Okay.

130
00:09:47.369 --> 00:09:49.545
Where are the...

131
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:53.027
Can I help you?

132
00:09:53.027 --> 00:09:54.506
Captain Singh.

133
00:09:54.506 --> 00:09:56.117
Uh. it's Detective.

134
00:09:56.117 --> 00:09:57.118
Do I know you?

135
00:09:57.118 --> 00:09:58.380
No. No.

136
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.251
I just--
I call everyone Captain.

137
00:10:00.251 --> 00:10:01.992
So I--hey. Captain.

138
00:10:01.992 --> 00:10:03.646
Morning. Cap.

139
00:10:04.865 --> 00:10:05.909
It's a weird thing I have.

140
00:10:05.909 --> 00:10:07.650
I'm looking for Joe West.

141
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.087
I'm an old family friend.

142
00:10:10.087 --> 00:10:11.698
Okay.

143
00:10:11.698 --> 00:10:13.743
Yeah. West is right back there.

144
00:10:15.223 --> 00:10:16.616
- Thanks.
- All right.

145
00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.139
Love the hair.

146
00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:30.847
Excuse me. Officer West.

147
00:10:32.588 --> 00:10:34.024
I need your help.

148
00:10:35.765 --> 00:10:37.637
Okay.

149
00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.116
Have a seat.

150
00:10:44.078 --> 00:10:49.953
So what seems to be
the trouble. Mister...

151
00:10:49.953 --> 00:10:52.521
I can't tell you my name.

152
00:10:52.521 --> 00:10:54.088
And I know
what you're thinking.

153
00:10:54.088 --> 00:10:56.264
Then you know
I need to see ID first.

154
00:10:56.264 --> 00:10:59.093
I'm stranded
very far away from home

155
00:10:59.093 --> 00:11:00.921
with no way to get back
on my own.

156
00:11:00.921 --> 00:11:01.922
So you need a bus ticket?

157
00:11:01.922 --> 00:11:04.011
No. I...

158
00:11:04.011 --> 00:11:07.101
I need your help
to find Dr. Tina McGee.

159
00:11:07.101 --> 00:11:09.146
She's the one person
that can help

160
00:11:09.146 --> 00:11:11.671
with my specific problem.

161
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:13.237
She's not listed
in the phone book.

162
00:11:13.237 --> 00:11:14.848
I need you to use
the C-NET database

163
00:11:14.848 --> 00:11:16.284
to get me her address.

164
00:11:16.284 --> 00:11:18.242
I'm supposed to do what?

165
00:11:18.242 --> 00:11:19.679
Oh. right.

166
00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.419
That system's still
two years away.

167
00:11:21.419 --> 00:11:24.509
Um. you can check
the city registry.

168
00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:26.337
I know you can access those.

169
00:11:26.337 --> 00:11:28.078
How do you know that?

170
00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:32.779
I'm sorry. kid.
but you walked in here

171
00:11:32.779 --> 00:11:35.782
asking me
for contact information

172
00:11:35.782 --> 00:11:37.871
for a private citizen.

173
00:11:37.871 --> 00:11:39.220
And you won't even tell me
your name?

174
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.656
I told you. I can't.

175
00:11:40.656 --> 00:11:42.179
I--okay. Look. I'm sorry.

176
00:11:42.179 --> 00:11:48.359
I just--if I do or say
the wrong thing...

177
00:11:48.359 --> 00:11:50.100
everything could change.

178
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.104
Officer. I--

179
00:11:54.104 --> 00:11:57.064
people have told me
if I'm ever in trouble.

180
00:11:57.064 --> 00:11:59.631
there's one person
I can turn to:

181
00:11:59.631 --> 00:12:01.633
Joe West.

182
00:12:01.633 --> 00:12:02.983
Now. look. I--I know

183
00:12:02.983 --> 00:12:05.855
you've got no reason
to trust me.

184
00:12:05.855 --> 00:12:09.859
but I'm asking you to.

185
00:12:09.859 --> 00:12:11.121
Please.

186
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.868
Well...

187
00:12:18.868 --> 00:12:22.742
my gut says
you're a good person

188
00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:25.657
who's going through
something bad.

189
00:12:25.657 --> 00:12:27.572
so I'm going to help.

190
00:12:27.572 --> 00:12:31.011
But now that I'm trusting you.

191
00:12:31.011 --> 00:12:33.665
I need to know the truth.

192
00:12:33.665 --> 00:12:34.884
Who are you?

193
00:12:34.884 --> 00:12:37.713
Okay.

194
00:12:37.713 --> 00:12:40.629
My name is...

195
00:12:45.242 --> 00:12:46.678
No!

196
00:12:51.727 --> 00:12:53.120
I have to go.

197
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.556
Hold on.

198
00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:08.309
- Come on.
<i>- Hello?</i>

199
00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:09.789
Professor Stein.

200
00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:12.748
Um. you don't know me yet.

201
00:13:12.748 --> 00:13:14.489
but um. I need you to listen.

202
00:13:14.489 --> 00:13:15.490
<i>Who is this?</i>

203
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.361
My name's Barry Allen.

204
00:13:17.361 --> 00:13:19.450
I'm from the future.
and I need your help.

205
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.496
<i>Pranking a physics expert
with time travel.</i>

206
00:13:21.496 --> 00:13:22.932
<i>Who put you up to this?</i>
- No one.

207
00:13:22.932 --> 00:13:24.673
Look. I swear
I'm telling the truth.

208
00:13:24.673 --> 00:13:26.457
I know about your research
into quantum anomalies.

209
00:13:26.457 --> 00:13:27.937
<i>I'm hanging up.</i>

210
00:13:27.937 --> 00:13:29.156
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

211
00:14:06.062 --> 00:14:07.194
Henry!

212
00:14:14.027 --> 00:14:15.506
My goodness.

213
00:14:15.506 --> 00:14:17.073
Henry. he looks
just like my father.

214
00:14:17.073 --> 00:14:18.466
Call 911.

215
00:14:50.237 --> 00:14:51.760
No. No. no.

216
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.761
I can't be here.

217
00:14:52.761 --> 00:14:54.284
Easy. I'm Dr. Allen.

218
00:14:54.284 --> 00:14:55.677
Whoa. now!

219
00:14:55.677 --> 00:14:56.765
You're gonna be in
a lot of pain.

220
00:14:56.765 --> 00:14:58.375
Where are my clothes?

221
00:14:58.375 --> 00:14:59.942
They're in the cabinet
in a bag. but listen.

222
00:14:59.942 --> 00:15:02.162
You need to stay put
so we can examine you.

223
00:15:02.162 --> 00:15:04.294
Thank goodness you're okay.

224
00:15:04.294 --> 00:15:06.731
Oh. sorry.
This is. uh. my wife. Nora.

225
00:15:06.731 --> 00:15:08.168
- Hi.
- She was with me

226
00:15:08.168 --> 00:15:10.344
at the scene of the accident.
- Mm.

227
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:14.478
What's your name?

228
00:15:14.478 --> 00:15:18.265
I--when we found you.
you didn't have any ID on you.

229
00:15:18.265 --> 00:15:19.353
Bart.

230
00:15:19.353 --> 00:15:20.571
Bart. is there someone

231
00:15:20.571 --> 00:15:22.008
that we can call for you?

232
00:15:22.008 --> 00:15:24.184
Family member. friend?

233
00:15:26.795 --> 00:15:28.101
Uh. no.
I appreciate all this.

234
00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:29.363
I can't be here.

235
00:15:29.363 --> 00:15:30.668
I mean.
you don't have to tell us

236
00:15:30.668 --> 00:15:32.583
anything you don't want to.

237
00:15:32.583 --> 00:15:35.021
Just know that right now.

238
00:15:35.021 --> 00:15:36.848
in this moment.

239
00:15:36.848 --> 00:15:38.328
you're not alone.

240
00:15:38.328 --> 00:15:39.590
Mm-hmm.

241
00:15:42.419 --> 00:15:44.465
Let us help you. son.

242
00:15:47.642 --> 00:15:49.513
What? Oh. whoa. I got you.

243
00:15:49.513 --> 00:15:51.907
Sorry. I just--
I've been running a lot.

244
00:15:51.907 --> 00:15:53.430
I just--my blood sugar
is just really low.

245
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:54.562
Does this hurt?

246
00:15:54.562 --> 00:15:56.085
Huh? That hurt?
- Henry.

247
00:15:56.085 --> 00:15:58.870
- I'm fine.
- Henry. the boy needs to eat.

248
00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.872
What about Zatara's?

249
00:16:00.872 --> 00:16:03.484
Well. they do have
the best pizza in town.

250
00:16:03.484 --> 00:16:04.876
So how about it? Our treat.

251
00:16:04.876 --> 00:16:06.313
They make a killer
New York slice.

252
00:16:06.313 --> 00:16:08.315
You're starving.
Let us feed you.

253
00:16:10.404 --> 00:16:12.797
I really. really shouldn't.

254
00:16:12.797 --> 00:16:15.670
And I won't take no
for an answer.

255
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.889
You're fighting
a losing game. kid.

256
00:16:23.243 --> 00:16:24.679
West.

257
00:16:25.897 --> 00:16:27.421
Thought this was a hit-and-run.

258
00:16:27.421 --> 00:16:30.119
Well. it turns out
the car never hit anyone.

259
00:16:30.119 --> 00:16:31.686
David. we're missing something.

260
00:16:31.686 --> 00:16:33.253
The kid who got hurt...
- Hmm?

261
00:16:33.253 --> 00:16:35.951
He was snooping around CCPD
this morning.

262
00:16:35.951 --> 00:16:38.736
So... I mean.
what's the connection?

263
00:16:38.736 --> 00:16:40.173
I don't know. but whatever

264
00:16:40.173 --> 00:16:42.305
he was running from
got him terrified.

265
00:16:42.305 --> 00:16:45.395
and my gut is telling me
that he needs our help.

266
00:16:45.395 --> 00:16:46.831
All right.

267
00:16:46.831 --> 00:16:48.529
I'll get the others
up to speed.

268
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:54.665
Joe...

269
00:16:57.538 --> 00:16:59.148
What in the world?

270
00:17:10.116 --> 00:17:11.813
Joe.

271
00:17:11.813 --> 00:17:13.119
You all right?

272
00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:16.513
Yeah. Never better.

273
00:17:21.779 --> 00:17:24.391
I can't thank you enough.

274
00:17:24.391 --> 00:17:27.959
Your son is very lucky
to have such amazing parents.

275
00:17:27.959 --> 00:17:29.352
And what about your folks?

276
00:17:29.352 --> 00:17:30.788
Where are they?

277
00:17:33.008 --> 00:17:34.314
They died.

278
00:17:34.314 --> 00:17:35.706
Oh.

279
00:17:35.706 --> 00:17:36.838
- I am so sorry.
- No.

280
00:17:36.838 --> 00:17:39.101
It's. um...

281
00:17:39.101 --> 00:17:40.798
it was a long time ago.

282
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:46.935
Although. sometimes it hurts
like it happened yesterday.

283
00:17:46.935 --> 00:17:50.373
I guess I'm still trying
to run away from all of it.

284
00:17:50.373 --> 00:17:53.681
Bart. no one is fast enough
to run from pain like that.

285
00:17:56.031 --> 00:17:59.600
Bart. do you believe in fate?

286
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.428
Because I do.

287
00:18:01.428 --> 00:18:05.693
That's why I believe that
there's a reason that we met.

288
00:18:05.693 --> 00:18:09.218
so that even for one day.

289
00:18:09.218 --> 00:18:12.308
you don't have to go through
all of this alone.

290
00:18:14.136 --> 00:18:16.878
Amen to that.

291
00:18:16.878 --> 00:18:19.228
Do you have someplace
to stay tonight?

292
00:18:19.228 --> 00:18:20.490
You shouldn't be alone.

293
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:21.926
Of course.

294
00:18:21.926 --> 00:18:23.754
Stay at our house.

295
00:18:26.496 --> 00:18:28.150
What? What is it?
- I'm sorry.

296
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.371
I should--uh. thank you
for--for everything.

297
00:18:31.371 --> 00:18:34.417
Um. it means more to me
than you could ever know.

298
00:18:34.417 --> 00:18:35.679
- I'm sorry.
- No. I--

299
00:18:35.679 --> 00:18:36.811
Bart. wait.

300
00:18:36.811 --> 00:18:38.682
Stay.
- I can't.

301
00:19:02.967 --> 00:19:05.753
Somebody's having a bad day.

302
00:19:05.753 --> 00:19:08.321
Unfortunately...

303
00:19:08.321 --> 00:19:09.974
It's only gonna get worse.

304
00:19:09.974 --> 00:19:12.455
Every time
I think you're gone.

305
00:19:12.455 --> 00:19:16.067
you come back
to destroy my life.

306
00:19:16.067 --> 00:19:17.939
That ends today. Thawne.

307
00:19:30.343 --> 00:19:32.475
Go on!

308
00:19:32.475 --> 00:19:33.694
Do it!

309
00:19:42.442 --> 00:19:44.095
Oh. predictable as always.

310
00:19:44.095 --> 00:19:45.184
Shut up!

311
00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:46.446
So?

312
00:19:46.446 --> 00:19:48.448
What are we doing
in the year 2000?

313
00:19:48.448 --> 00:19:49.927
Cut the crap.
I know you brought me here.

314
00:19:49.927 --> 00:19:53.757
Um. no. I didn't.

315
00:19:55.803 --> 00:19:57.587
Well. then.

316
00:19:57.587 --> 00:19:59.154
I guess that makes our meeting
just a case

317
00:19:59.154 --> 00:20:02.897
of right place. right time. huh?

318
00:20:04.028 --> 00:20:06.988
Oh. Flash...

319
00:20:06.988 --> 00:20:11.427
we are gonna have the most
wonderful day together.

320
00:20:23.657 --> 00:20:25.006
To us.

321
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.228
You're not thirsty. Ah.

322
00:20:32.579 --> 00:20:34.189
Mmm.

323
00:20:35.886 --> 00:20:37.018
Mmm.

324
00:20:37.018 --> 00:20:39.063
Oh. boy. That's good.

325
00:20:40.326 --> 00:20:41.631
You seem tense;

326
00:20:41.631 --> 00:20:43.198
I really think
you should try it.

327
00:20:43.198 --> 00:20:44.721
Why don't you just tell me
what you want.

328
00:20:46.114 --> 00:20:49.073
To enjoy
this very special day.

329
00:20:49.073 --> 00:20:54.383
I mean. maybe this is
some sort of cosmic gift.

330
00:20:54.383 --> 00:20:57.125
the chance to torture you
slowly one last time

331
00:20:57.125 --> 00:20:59.823
before I end your existence entirely.

332
00:21:05.307 --> 00:21:08.092
You're here to kill me
as a child.

333
00:21:08.092 --> 00:21:10.530
You always were smart.

334
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.533
Too bad you're not smart enough
to save yourself this time.

335
00:21:13.533 --> 00:21:16.187
See. there's only two ways
you can stop me tonight.

336
00:21:16.187 --> 00:21:18.451
One is to put me
in Iron Heights right now

337
00:21:18.451 --> 00:21:20.409
and risk destroying
the timeline.

338
00:21:20.409 --> 00:21:23.499
which would wipe
that wonderful wife and family

339
00:21:23.499 --> 00:21:27.242
right from existence
in just a heartbeat.

340
00:21:27.242 --> 00:21:29.462
And the second option?

341
00:21:29.462 --> 00:21:33.640
You have to kill me.
which you won't.

342
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.946
So I guess...

343
00:21:35.946 --> 00:21:38.035
I've already won.

344
00:21:40.516 --> 00:21:44.215
How'd the parental reunion go
today?

345
00:21:44.215 --> 00:21:46.000
Did it feel good
to have them care for you

346
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.001
one last time?

347
00:21:47.001 --> 00:21:48.263
Did you feel loved?

348
00:21:48.263 --> 00:21:51.222
Did you feel like
you had a family?

349
00:21:51.222 --> 00:21:54.922
You attacked me this morning.

350
00:21:54.922 --> 00:21:56.706
You knew they'd help me.

351
00:21:56.706 --> 00:21:58.795
It must hurt
to not be able to tell them

352
00:21:58.795 --> 00:22:01.232
that you're their son.

353
00:22:01.232 --> 00:22:03.583
Tell me. does being
this close to them again

354
00:22:03.583 --> 00:22:07.369
bring back all the pain
I have ever given you?

355
00:22:11.242 --> 00:22:12.809
Good.

356
00:22:14.594 --> 00:22:16.944
If your plan's so perfect.

357
00:22:16.944 --> 00:22:19.294
why are you wasting
so much time?

358
00:22:19.294 --> 00:22:21.470
Why not just wipe me
off the face of the Earth

359
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.080
right now?

360
00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.605
And ruin
my pièce de résistance?

361
00:22:25.605 --> 00:22:26.997
No. no. no. no.

362
00:22:26.997 --> 00:22:28.825
I'm going to savor
this entire day

363
00:22:28.825 --> 00:22:31.132
and the peace
that it's brought me.

364
00:22:31.132 --> 00:22:36.050
Now. there's one last thing.

365
00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:38.487
I want to hear you say it. Barry.

366
00:22:47.148 --> 00:22:48.758
Say it.

367
00:22:51.152 --> 00:22:53.415
You win.

368
00:22:53.415 --> 00:22:55.504
I can't stop you.

369
00:23:03.599 --> 00:23:05.775
Delicious.

370
00:23:11.259 --> 00:23:14.436
You can't walk away from
what's about to happen. Barry.

371
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:22.009
I know.

372
00:23:22.009 --> 00:23:24.664
I can walk towards it.

373
00:23:31.671 --> 00:23:33.324
<i>I can't stop thinking that</i>

374
00:23:33.324 --> 00:23:34.848
<i>we should be out there
looking for him.</i>

375
00:23:34.848 --> 00:23:37.241
I know.

376
00:23:37.241 --> 00:23:39.940
I feel it too.

377
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.639
But we just met the boy.

378
00:23:43.639 --> 00:23:48.644
And you can't give someone help
who doesn't want it.

379
00:23:50.733 --> 00:23:53.823
It's not that
I don't want your help.

380
00:23:53.823 --> 00:23:55.521
We've been worried about you.

381
00:23:59.307 --> 00:24:02.179
Well. that means
the world to me.

382
00:24:02.179 --> 00:24:04.530
especially today.

383
00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:07.358
Ever since they passed.
I've never stopped wondering...

384
00:24:10.187 --> 00:24:12.712
You know. what I would give

385
00:24:12.712 --> 00:24:16.933
to have them back
for just one more day.

386
00:24:16.933 --> 00:24:20.850
And if that happened.
what I would say.

387
00:24:22.504 --> 00:24:25.855
You can tell us.

388
00:24:25.855 --> 00:24:29.511
I'd say...

389
00:24:29.511 --> 00:24:34.211
your love made me who I am.

390
00:24:36.562 --> 00:24:39.652
And despite the darkness.

391
00:24:39.652 --> 00:24:43.656
I still carry your light
inside me every single day.

392
00:24:46.136 --> 00:24:47.747
So will your granddaughter.

393
00:24:50.271 --> 00:24:52.491
I know your parents
would have loved that.

394
00:24:52.491 --> 00:24:55.232
And have no doubt.

395
00:24:55.232 --> 00:24:58.148
whoever they are.

396
00:24:58.148 --> 00:25:00.063
they're proud of you. son.

397
00:25:14.469 --> 00:25:15.775
- You okay?
- Yeah.

398
00:25:15.775 --> 00:25:17.428
I just feel like
maybe we should--

399
00:25:17.428 --> 00:25:20.649
I just--I just want
to talk to him about this.

400
00:25:20.649 --> 00:25:23.304
Bart?

401
00:25:23.304 --> 00:25:25.175
Take care of that little baby.

402
00:25:35.751 --> 00:25:40.234
Barry...

403
00:25:50.244 --> 00:25:54.727
<i>Barry...</i>

404
00:26:04.911 --> 00:26:06.260
Barry.

405
00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.478
It's okay.

406
00:26:07.478 --> 00:26:09.959
It's me.
- Joe?

407
00:26:09.959 --> 00:26:14.355
And I know you've been stuck
here in the past.

408
00:26:14.355 --> 00:26:15.922
Oh. thank God.

409
00:26:15.922 --> 00:26:17.401
I have no idea how I got here.

410
00:26:17.401 --> 00:26:19.273
Relax. son.

411
00:26:19.273 --> 00:26:20.927
Everything's fine now.
- No. it's not.

412
00:26:20.927 --> 00:26:23.843
Look. I can't make contact
with the Speed Force.

413
00:26:23.843 --> 00:26:27.020
And Thawne kills my mom today.

414
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.588
I know.

415
00:26:31.024 --> 00:26:33.113
You okay?

416
00:26:33.113 --> 00:26:35.594
Look. whatever's affecting me.
it could be affecting you also.

417
00:26:35.594 --> 00:26:37.073
Maybe that's why
you're remembering things.

418
00:26:37.073 --> 00:26:41.251
Barry.
I know what happens today...

419
00:26:41.251 --> 00:26:42.775
because I've been
waiting for it

420
00:26:42.775 --> 00:26:44.646
since the dawn of time.

421
00:26:55.614 --> 00:26:58.312
You're not Joe.

422
00:26:58.312 --> 00:27:00.357
Who are you?

423
00:27:00.357 --> 00:27:02.055
What the hell do you want?

424
00:27:02.055 --> 00:27:04.144
To level the playing field

425
00:27:04.144 --> 00:27:07.103
by correcting the imbalance
your legacy created.

426
00:27:08.888 --> 00:27:12.369
Negative Speed Force.

427
00:27:12.369 --> 00:27:15.634
You're the new Avatar?

428
00:27:15.634 --> 00:27:17.461
That's impossible.
Joe doesn't hate me.

429
00:27:17.461 --> 00:27:20.508
No. I'm not the Avatar.

430
00:27:20.508 --> 00:27:22.423
You killed him. remember?

431
00:27:25.861 --> 00:27:30.083
I'm the real deal.

432
00:27:30.083 --> 00:27:33.216
You're going to pay
for what you've done.

433
00:27:33.216 --> 00:27:35.392
You wanna fight me?

434
00:27:35.392 --> 00:27:38.004
Fine. Let Joe go.

435
00:27:38.004 --> 00:27:39.788
I can't.

436
00:27:39.788 --> 00:27:41.877
He's part of the plan.

437
00:27:41.877 --> 00:27:44.706
They all are.

438
00:27:44.706 --> 00:27:48.710
Now shut up and die.

439
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:50.451
Ahh!

440
00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.761
What's happening?

441
00:27:55.761 --> 00:27:56.805
Was that an explosion?

442
00:27:56.805 --> 00:27:57.893
Is my dad safe?

443
00:27:57.893 --> 00:27:58.981
Everyone. please. listen.

444
00:27:58.981 --> 00:28:00.461
We're calling CCPD.

445
00:28:00.461 --> 00:28:01.767
Stay calm.

446
00:28:01.767 --> 00:28:03.203
and we will get everyone
to safety.

447
00:28:03.203 --> 00:28:04.857
I promise. Come.

448
00:28:07.686 --> 00:28:08.730
We have a code green.

449
00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:10.297
Evacuate all patients.

450
00:28:10.297 --> 00:28:11.733
visitors.
and hospital personnel.

451
00:28:11.733 --> 00:28:12.778
in that order.

452
00:28:12.778 --> 00:28:13.866
Understood?

453
00:28:25.791 --> 00:28:28.184
You want to know
what's gonna happen next?

454
00:28:28.184 --> 00:28:30.447
I can tell you.

455
00:28:30.447 --> 00:28:34.321
You're going to experience
a world of pain.

456
00:28:35.714 --> 00:28:37.019
I don't think so.

457
00:28:37.019 --> 00:28:38.934
Ooh.

458
00:28:38.934 --> 00:28:40.544
Is that a threat?

459
00:28:40.544 --> 00:28:42.024
A promise.

460
00:28:42.024 --> 00:28:44.374
I'm not afraid of you. boy.

461
00:28:44.374 --> 00:28:45.680
I'm a force of nature.

462
00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.247
But this body?

463
00:28:47.247 --> 00:28:48.683
It's human.

464
00:28:48.683 --> 00:28:51.207
which means
the real Joe West

465
00:28:51.207 --> 00:28:53.819
is still trapped inside.

466
00:28:53.819 --> 00:28:55.081
That's right.

467
00:28:55.081 --> 00:28:58.040
Kill me.

468
00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.825
and you kill your own father.

469
00:28:59.825 --> 00:29:01.522
This is useless.

470
00:29:01.522 --> 00:29:03.089
Neither of us can win.

471
00:29:03.089 --> 00:29:04.438
Thawne died.

472
00:29:04.438 --> 00:29:08.224
So can you.

473
00:29:10.574 --> 00:29:11.880
Everyone. keep moving.

474
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.229
Come on. Stay calm.

475
00:29:13.229 --> 00:29:14.622
Who's in charge here?

476
00:29:14.622 --> 00:29:16.058
Dr. Rachel Rosso.
chief of surgery.

477
00:29:16.058 --> 00:29:18.365
Doctor. that felt like
a damn earthquake.

478
00:29:18.365 --> 00:29:19.845
It started
with an electrical surge

479
00:29:19.845 --> 00:29:21.237
throughout the entire building.

480
00:29:21.237 --> 00:29:22.848
Now everything
from heart monitors

481
00:29:22.848 --> 00:29:24.371
to surveillance cameras
are down.

482
00:29:24.371 --> 00:29:26.460
Okay.
We'll help with the evacuation.

483
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:27.809
Any idea
what could be causing it?

484
00:29:27.809 --> 00:29:29.898
No. but the hospital's
East Wing

485
00:29:29.898 --> 00:29:31.204
is under construction.

486
00:29:31.204 --> 00:29:32.814
I think whatever's happening

487
00:29:32.814 --> 00:29:33.989
may have started there.

488
00:29:35.512 --> 00:29:37.732
Give me that flashlight.

489
00:29:37.732 --> 00:29:39.038
I need you to call for backup.

490
00:29:39.038 --> 00:29:40.648
I'm gonna find out
what's going on.

491
00:29:40.648 --> 00:29:43.564
I need you to get you
and your staff to safety.

492
00:29:43.564 --> 00:29:45.000
Let's get him out of here.

493
00:29:50.179 --> 00:29:52.703
Come on out. son.

494
00:29:52.703 --> 00:29:57.665
'cause no matter where you go
or how fast you run.

495
00:29:57.665 --> 00:30:01.060
I'll always find you.

496
00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.844
What's it gonna be?

497
00:30:02.844 --> 00:30:07.849
You gonna come face me here
and now and risk dying?

498
00:30:07.849 --> 00:30:12.462
Or are you gonna run away
to save Mama

499
00:30:12.462 --> 00:30:16.771
and risk losing everything
by altering the timeline.

500
00:30:16.771 --> 00:30:21.254
including little Nora?

501
00:30:51.458 --> 00:30:53.242
CCPD. Show yourself!

502
00:31:09.476 --> 00:31:13.132
Give up and die. boy.

503
00:31:13.132 --> 00:31:16.657
You have no choice.

504
00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.059
No.

505
00:31:27.059 --> 00:31:29.452
No. no. no. no.

506
00:31:30.323 --> 00:31:31.411
Joe.

507
00:31:31.411 --> 00:31:32.586
Joe?

508
00:31:35.589 --> 00:31:37.156
Joe.

509
00:31:39.158 --> 00:31:43.379
You were the chosen one
for nine years.

510
00:31:43.379 --> 00:31:47.949
But tonight.
a new world begins.

511
00:32:05.358 --> 00:32:06.881
Ahh!

512
00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.171
CCPD!

513
00:32:36.171 --> 00:32:37.564
Who's up here?

514
00:33:09.248 --> 00:33:10.597
<i>Run. Barry! Run!</i>

515
00:33:12.512 --> 00:33:13.904
<i>Barry!</i>

516
00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:19.214
<i>Run. Barry. run!</i>

517
00:33:29.181 --> 00:33:32.271
You'd actually destroy
an entire timeline

518
00:33:32.271 --> 00:33:35.230
just to save
your own pathetic existence?

519
00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:37.319
No. Thawne.

520
00:33:37.319 --> 00:33:40.540
I'm not here to save myself.

521
00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:43.151
I'm here to save you.

522
00:33:51.986 --> 00:33:55.033
You want to save me.

523
00:33:55.033 --> 00:33:56.251
Is this a joke?

524
00:33:56.251 --> 00:33:58.079
No. I'm serious.

525
00:33:58.079 --> 00:33:59.689
Thawne. do you remember
that day you told me

526
00:33:59.689 --> 00:34:02.866
about 170 years from now.

527
00:34:02.866 --> 00:34:05.304
when you presented yourself
to the world.

528
00:34:05.304 --> 00:34:06.914
finally gained speed
of your own?

529
00:34:06.914 --> 00:34:09.134
Greatest day
of my entire life.

530
00:34:09.134 --> 00:34:10.918
Until now.

531
00:34:10.918 --> 00:34:14.748
Up until that point
in your life. you admired me.

532
00:34:14.748 --> 00:34:16.489
You wanted to be a hero.

533
00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:19.927
And you destroyed
everything I'd worked for.

534
00:34:19.927 --> 00:34:22.712
You saved that crowd.

535
00:34:22.712 --> 00:34:25.367
You took the credit
that I should have had.

536
00:34:25.367 --> 00:34:27.456
I know.

537
00:34:27.456 --> 00:34:28.979
And I'm sorry.

538
00:34:31.808 --> 00:34:34.028
Is that what this is all about.

539
00:34:34.028 --> 00:34:36.161
making amends
for ruining my life?

540
00:34:36.161 --> 00:34:37.814
Well. it's too late.

541
00:34:37.814 --> 00:34:40.121
No. it doesn't have to be.

542
00:34:40.121 --> 00:34:42.471
You can still have
a better life.

543
00:34:42.471 --> 00:34:44.778
the life you once saw
for yourself.

544
00:34:44.778 --> 00:34:46.084
Don't you see?

545
00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:49.261
All we do
is cause each other pain.

546
00:34:49.261 --> 00:34:54.614
But tonight.
you can change all that

547
00:34:54.614 --> 00:34:57.051
if you just walk away.

548
00:34:57.051 --> 00:34:59.009
That's not
what this is about.

549
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:06.016
You know I win tonight.

550
00:35:08.454 --> 00:35:11.021
That's what this is all about.

551
00:35:11.021 --> 00:35:14.416
You win one battle. Thawne.
not the war between us.

552
00:35:14.416 --> 00:35:17.115
Neither of us could do that.

553
00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:20.640
But if you don't walk away tonight.

554
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:24.078
you will lose everything.

555
00:35:32.391 --> 00:35:34.044
Liar.

556
00:35:34.044 --> 00:35:37.309
Don't you know who I am?

557
00:35:37.309 --> 00:35:39.049
I have always been the hero.

558
00:35:39.049 --> 00:35:41.313
You're the villain. Flash.

559
00:35:41.313 --> 00:35:44.446
You're the one
who reversed my entire life

560
00:35:44.446 --> 00:35:46.448
and dragged me into hell.

561
00:35:46.448 --> 00:35:50.583
And that's why you die tonight.
by my hand.

562
00:36:18.176 --> 00:36:20.743
Mom!

563
00:36:20.743 --> 00:36:21.831
- Barry. no!
- Mom!

564
00:36:21.831 --> 00:36:23.050
Run!

565
00:36:28.098 --> 00:36:32.146
Mom!

566
00:36:34.279 --> 00:36:36.063
Nora! Hold on!

567
00:36:43.766 --> 00:36:45.638
Run. Barry! Run!

568
00:36:46.769 --> 00:36:47.988
Barry!

569
00:36:47.988 --> 00:36:50.120
No!

570
00:37:08.574 --> 00:37:11.054
Gideon. what's happening to me?

571
00:37:11.054 --> 00:37:13.187
<i>Your ability to move
at super speed</i>

572
00:37:13.187 --> 00:37:16.277
<i>as well as travel in time
has been completely depleted.</i>

573
00:37:16.277 --> 00:37:18.932
How am I supposed
to get back?

574
00:37:18.932 --> 00:37:22.022
<i>You can't.</i>

575
00:37:37.951 --> 00:37:41.128
I don't understand.

576
00:37:41.128 --> 00:37:47.917
You saved yourself
and let me kill her instead.

577
00:37:47.917 --> 00:37:49.571
Why?

578
00:37:49.571 --> 00:37:51.530
I had no choice.

579
00:37:53.749 --> 00:37:57.187
Killing your mother...

580
00:37:57.187 --> 00:38:00.278
it's a fixed point.

581
00:38:00.278 --> 00:38:03.106
You knew this was gonna happen.

582
00:38:03.106 --> 00:38:05.283
And now I'm stuck here

583
00:38:05.283 --> 00:38:08.416
in a hell where
I get to watch you grow up

584
00:38:08.416 --> 00:38:11.245
and become the hero
that I should have been!

585
00:38:12.855 --> 00:38:15.162
I swear...

586
00:38:15.162 --> 00:38:17.556
even if I have to tear
the universe apart.

587
00:38:17.556 --> 00:38:20.210
I will find a way
to destroy you

588
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:22.822
and everyone you love!

589
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.481
Because
from this moment forward.

590
00:38:29.481 --> 00:38:33.833
my life's work will be
finding ways to kill you.

591
00:38:33.833 --> 00:38:36.749
I know.

592
00:38:36.749 --> 00:38:42.320
And this night tortured me
for decades.

593
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.931
Not anymore.

594
00:38:44.931 --> 00:38:49.370
Because today I got to see
my parents one last time

595
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:52.286
and feel how much
they loved me.

596
00:38:54.027 --> 00:38:56.899
This is the worst night
of your life.

597
00:38:56.899 --> 00:38:58.988
I know it.

598
00:38:58.988 --> 00:39:00.338
And today brought me
the peace

599
00:39:00.338 --> 00:39:03.776
I've been looking for
ever since.

600
00:39:03.776 --> 00:39:07.214
I have you to thank for that. Eobard.

601
00:39:07.214 --> 00:39:10.652
and I'll always be grateful.

602
00:39:18.747 --> 00:39:24.405
No!

603
00:39:28.931 --> 00:39:32.326
<i>♪ I guess
that's why they call it ♪</i>

604
00:39:32.326 --> 00:39:34.633
<i>♪ The blues ♪</i>

605
00:39:34.633 --> 00:39:37.592
<i>♪ Time on my hands ♪</i>

606
00:39:37.592 --> 00:39:40.987
<i>♪ Could be time spent
with you ♪</i>

607
00:39:48.386 --> 00:39:50.562
Great.

608
00:39:50.562 --> 00:39:53.565
That's the last thing
I need on a deadline.

609
00:40:22.594 --> 00:40:24.422
That's impossible.

610
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:44.719
Who the hell is Eddie Thawne?

611
00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.620
Greg. move your head.
