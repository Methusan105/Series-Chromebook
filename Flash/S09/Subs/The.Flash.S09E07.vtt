1
00:00:28.637 --> 00:00:30.160
Not my first rodeo.

2
00:00:43.608 --> 00:00:47.438
If you're trying to stop me.
you can't.

3
00:00:47.438 --> 00:00:49.832
not when I'm this close.

4
00:00:49.832 --> 00:00:50.920
Ugh!

5
00:00:59.972 --> 00:01:02.453
And I've come too far
to let you stand in my way.

6
00:01:17.425 --> 00:01:20.993
Nia. it's about control.

7
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.040
Iris!

8
00:01:26.347 --> 00:01:28.392
Iris.
Iris!

9
00:01:28.392 --> 00:01:30.873
What did you do to her?
Why did you kill her?

10
00:01:33.528 --> 00:01:34.790
Why?

11
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.052
Why? Why Iris?

12
00:01:36.052 --> 00:01:37.532
Why did you kill her?

13
00:01:37.532 --> 00:01:40.361
Why?
Iris!

14
00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:41.884
Ma'am?

15
00:01:41.884 --> 00:01:43.407
I--I don't know
what your problem is.

16
00:01:43.407 --> 00:01:44.930
but if you can't
control yourself.

17
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.280
I'm going to have
to ask you to--

18
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.456
I know.
I'm going.

19
00:01:48.456 --> 00:01:50.458
I have to get to Central City.

20
00:02:19.313 --> 00:02:21.315
Oh. give me a second.

21
00:02:21.315 --> 00:02:23.230
<i>- Hey.</i>

22
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.406
<i>I just want to see how
the article's coming along.</i>

23
00:02:25.406 --> 00:02:27.408
Uh. it's my best work yet.

24
00:02:27.408 --> 00:02:29.584
It's definitely a game changer.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

25
00:02:29.584 --> 00:02:31.629
<i>Are you gonna finally tell me
what it's about?</i>

26
00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.892
Well. you can find out
tonight. when I publish it.

27
00:02:33.892 --> 00:02:34.893
<i>along with everybody else.</i>

28
00:02:34.893 --> 00:02:36.634
Okay. fine.

29
00:02:36.634 --> 00:02:37.853
You still feeling
hungry every hour?

30
00:02:37.853 --> 00:02:39.333
<i>Yup.</i>

31
00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:40.812
And now I think I know
where Nora gets

32
00:02:40.812 --> 00:02:43.075
her obsession
with cheese fries from.

33
00:02:43.075 --> 00:02:45.556
<i>Hey. well. Helena's
on Third Street</i>

34
00:02:45.556 --> 00:02:47.384
<i>has gourmet cheese fries.</i>

35
00:02:47.384 --> 00:02:48.820
<i>You want me to make
a late dinner reservation?</i>

36
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.388
No. I can't.
I gotta get back to it.

37
00:02:51.388 --> 00:02:53.260
<i>Okay. well. I'll leave
something for you</i>

38
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.131
<i>in the microwave.
Don't work too late.</i>

39
00:02:55.131 --> 00:02:56.437
I won't.
I love you.

40
00:02:56.437 --> 00:02:57.742
<i>Love you.</i>

41
00:02:59.527 --> 00:03:02.138
Okay.
Let's see.

42
00:03:02.138 --> 00:03:03.618
- Hey. boss.
- Hi.

43
00:03:03.618 --> 00:03:04.836
So I finished the layout

44
00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:06.316
for your article
on the Red Death.

45
00:03:06.316 --> 00:03:08.884
and check out the title
I came up with.

46
00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:15.760
I call it
my Mapbook.

47
00:03:23.377 --> 00:03:24.900
What's wrong?

48
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.771
Um. nothing.

49
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:28.120
I just--I wasn't
expecting to see

50
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.035
that exact headline so soon.

51
00:03:30.035 --> 00:03:33.952
Wait.
Is this the article.

52
00:03:33.952 --> 00:03:36.433
the one from Barry's Mapbook
that you win the Pulitzer for?

53
00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:37.652
Yeah.

54
00:03:37.652 --> 00:03:39.219
Oh. my God.

55
00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.698
Can I congratulate you now?

56
00:03:40.698 --> 00:03:42.134
Well. I haven't
published it yet.

57
00:03:42.134 --> 00:03:44.049
Right. but. Iris.

58
00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.529
this is your destiny.

59
00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:47.531
and it's happening right now.

60
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:51.579
You must be so excited
to publish. right?

61
00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:52.623
Um...

62
00:03:52.623 --> 00:03:55.191
Actually. I'm gonna wait.

63
00:03:55.191 --> 00:03:56.540
Yeah. I still have
some tinkering.

64
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.628
and I think I want
to sleep on it.

65
00:03:57.628 --> 00:03:58.716
I get it.

66
00:03:58.716 --> 00:04:00.414
You want it to be perfect.

67
00:04:00.414 --> 00:04:03.504
Well. I'll leave you to it.
Miss Pulitzer.

68
00:04:03.504 --> 00:04:05.201
Hmm!

69
00:04:05.201 --> 00:04:06.550
Okay.

70
00:04:17.344 --> 00:04:19.955
Khione. you did it.

71
00:04:19.955 --> 00:04:21.043
You unlocked your ice powers.

72
00:04:21.043 --> 00:04:22.262
This is great!

73
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:23.437
Am I a superhero now?

74
00:04:23.437 --> 00:04:25.047
Let's make sure.

75
00:04:25.047 --> 00:04:26.918
Grab the container.

76
00:04:26.918 --> 00:04:28.746
Now. it's filled
with a cryochemical fluid

77
00:04:28.746 --> 00:04:30.661
with an extremely low
freezing point.

78
00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:33.490
If you can ice it too.
then we'll really have

79
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.752
something to celebrate!

80
00:04:34.752 --> 00:04:36.754
Oh. I am so sorry.

81
00:04:36.754 --> 00:04:37.886
No. no.
It's totally cool.

82
00:04:39.148 --> 00:04:41.063
I hate shirts anyway.

83
00:04:43.674 --> 00:04:45.372
Yeah.
You know what?

84
00:04:45.372 --> 00:04:46.460
That was a stupid thing to do.

85
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.288
I am gonna put it back on.

86
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.377
We should really try
to keep these things on.

87
00:04:50.377 --> 00:04:51.378
I--

88
00:04:51.378 --> 00:04:54.685
<i>♪ Ooh. baby ♪</i>

89
00:04:54.685 --> 00:04:56.470
Huh.

90
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.036
<i>- ♪ I know everything ♪</i>
- Or do that.

91
00:04:58.036 --> 00:04:59.995
<i>♪ Everything makes me
feel fine ♪</i>

92
00:04:59.995 --> 00:05:02.258
You sure about this?

93
00:05:02.258 --> 00:05:03.781
<i>♪ When I get
your sweet lovin' ♪</i>

94
00:05:03.781 --> 00:05:05.653
Definitely.

95
00:05:05.653 --> 00:05:09.613
<i>♪ And hold your body
close to mine ♪</i>

96
00:05:09.613 --> 00:05:11.311
Okay.

97
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.921
<i>♪ I get higher ♪</i>

98
00:05:12.921 --> 00:05:15.010
Mwah.

99
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.013
You're so amazing.

100
00:05:18.013 --> 00:05:21.103
I love you too.

101
00:05:21.103 --> 00:05:24.367
Mm-hmm.

102
00:05:24.367 --> 00:05:25.673
What?

103
00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:29.285
What?

104
00:05:29.285 --> 00:05:31.853
So what's so amazing?

105
00:05:31.853 --> 00:05:34.334
Sorry. I must have fallen
asleep on monitor duty.

106
00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.510
It won't happen again.

107
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.728
Were you dreaming?

108
00:05:37.728 --> 00:05:39.121
No.

109
00:05:39.121 --> 00:05:41.210
I mean. yes.
Why? Maybe.

110
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.169
Were you professing your love
to someone in your sleep?

111
00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.128
No.

112
00:05:46.128 --> 00:05:47.912
No. who does that?

113
00:05:47.912 --> 00:05:50.698
I'm almost embarrassed.

114
00:05:50.698 --> 00:05:53.831
By your secret crush
and the love you feel for them?

115
00:05:53.831 --> 00:05:56.094
By my not-so-secret love
of bourbon.

116
00:05:56.094 --> 00:05:58.270
which is why I fell asleep
on monitor duty.

117
00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.317
Okay. party person.

118
00:06:01.317 --> 00:06:03.624
Well. now you can go catch
some Zs somewhere else.

119
00:06:03.624 --> 00:06:05.887
'cause I gotta start
my shift today.

120
00:06:05.887 --> 00:06:07.149
showing Khione the ropes.

121
00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:08.672
- Awesome.
- Yes.

122
00:06:08.672 --> 00:06:10.413
That way. I can contribute
to Team Flash

123
00:06:10.413 --> 00:06:11.936
while we figure out
if my powers

124
00:06:11.936 --> 00:06:13.808
can be useful in the field.

125
00:06:13.808 --> 00:06:17.333
I just--I wish we could work
somewhere with a view.

126
00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:20.162
I mean. Kesha. Bob. and I.
we really thrive outside.

127
00:06:20.162 --> 00:06:22.164
Mm. yeah.

128
00:06:22.164 --> 00:06:23.905
You know.
you're right. Khione.

129
00:06:23.905 --> 00:06:27.517
It's too nice a day
to spend inside training.

130
00:06:27.517 --> 00:06:29.171
Let's go out.

131
00:06:29.171 --> 00:06:31.739
Chester. you can train her
on comms anytime. right?

132
00:06:31.739 --> 00:06:35.177
Uh. I guess.

133
00:06:35.177 --> 00:06:36.700
- Can we go to a park?
- Oh. please.

134
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.267
We can do even better
than a park.

135
00:06:38.267 --> 00:06:40.095
Trust me. I know
all the cool things we can do.

136
00:06:40.095 --> 00:06:41.444
Are you in?
- Okay.

137
00:06:41.444 --> 00:06:43.185
Thanks. Chester.

138
00:06:43.185 --> 00:06:44.360
Mm-hmm.

139
00:06:49.713 --> 00:06:52.716
Iris.

140
00:06:52.716 --> 00:06:55.806
Nia.
Hi.

141
00:06:55.806 --> 00:06:57.025
What are you doing
in Central City?

142
00:06:57.025 --> 00:06:58.287
I came to see you.

143
00:06:58.287 --> 00:06:59.593
Sorry to pop in so late.

144
00:06:59.593 --> 00:07:00.898
No. it's fine.

145
00:07:00.898 --> 00:07:02.509
I had a great time
at mimosa brunch

146
00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:04.293
with you. Kara. Alex. and Ryan.

147
00:07:04.293 --> 00:07:06.469
But I just--I didn't expect
to see you again so soon.

148
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:08.210
Yeah. it was great
to finally meet you.

149
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.865
I didn't want
to make it a thing.

150
00:07:10.865 --> 00:07:12.780
but you're kind of
my career role model.

151
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.738
- I am?
- Yeah. I mean.

152
00:07:14.738 --> 00:07:17.175
that story you told us
about being kidnapped by Cicada

153
00:07:17.175 --> 00:07:18.481
and then fighting your way out

154
00:07:18.481 --> 00:07:19.961
and writing about it
the next day

155
00:07:19.961 --> 00:07:21.353
like nothing happened?

156
00:07:21.353 --> 00:07:23.312
It still gives me goosebumps.

157
00:07:23.312 --> 00:07:25.314
Well. look. I'm--
I'm happy to see you.

158
00:07:25.314 --> 00:07:28.317
but what's up
with the late visit?

159
00:07:28.317 --> 00:07:29.405
What's going on?

160
00:07:31.973 --> 00:07:33.322
Oh.

161
00:07:33.322 --> 00:07:35.280
For the past five years.
as Dreamer.

162
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.021
I've been honing my powers.

163
00:07:37.021 --> 00:07:40.634
And not to brag.
but I can turn dream energy

164
00:07:40.634 --> 00:07:42.679
<i>into just about anything.</i>

165
00:07:45.116 --> 00:07:46.596
So lately.
I've been trying

166
00:07:46.596 --> 00:07:48.468
to take my powers
to the next level.

167
00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:52.297
And I read
about this ancient source

168
00:07:52.297 --> 00:07:53.777
of Naltorian dream energy.

169
00:07:53.777 --> 00:07:56.214
So I've been going
into the dream realm

170
00:07:56.214 --> 00:07:57.259
to try to find it.

171
00:07:57.259 --> 00:07:58.652
and I could sense

172
00:07:58.652 --> 00:08:01.089
that I was close
in my last dream.

173
00:08:01.089 --> 00:08:04.788
And then...

174
00:08:04.788 --> 00:08:06.964
my powers got erased.

175
00:08:06.964 --> 00:08:08.052
Look.

176
00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:15.973
Normally.
something happens here.

177
00:08:15.973 --> 00:08:17.975
It's like every time
I try to call on it.

178
00:08:17.975 --> 00:08:20.282
it just feels further away.

179
00:08:20.282 --> 00:08:22.371
And I know this is
gonna sound crazy.

180
00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:24.329
but I think that
the only person

181
00:08:24.329 --> 00:08:26.070
who can help me is you.

182
00:08:30.248 --> 00:08:31.989
Okay.
How?

183
00:08:31.989 --> 00:08:34.731
You were in my dream too.

184
00:08:34.731 --> 00:08:38.430
And. Iris. something
really bad happened.

185
00:08:40.432 --> 00:08:42.304
I'm sorry.

186
00:08:47.309 --> 00:08:48.353
Oh. no.

187
00:08:57.101 --> 00:08:59.451
Nia. what is it?
There's nothing there.

188
00:09:25.477 --> 00:09:26.522
What the hell?

189
00:09:26.522 --> 00:09:28.089
Oh. crap.

190
00:09:29.917 --> 00:09:31.222
Captain. look out!

191
00:09:34.704 --> 00:09:37.272
- Way to go! Great job!
- All right! Whoo!

192
00:09:40.449 --> 00:09:42.103
Nice one. Captain.

193
00:09:42.103 --> 00:09:43.713
Come on.

194
00:09:46.368 --> 00:09:48.196
How are we both
police officers?

195
00:09:48.196 --> 00:09:50.459
Because we're in a dream.

196
00:09:50.459 --> 00:09:51.547
Yours.

197
00:10:01.992 --> 00:10:04.255
So this is what my life
would have looked like

198
00:10:04.255 --> 00:10:06.562
if I was a police officer?

199
00:10:07.432 --> 00:10:10.044
"Captain."
Incredible.

200
00:10:10.044 --> 00:10:12.829
No. what's incredible is.
first you were in my dream.

201
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:14.701
and now I'm here
with you in yours.

202
00:10:14.701 --> 00:10:17.007
It's like we're having
a shared dreaming experience.

203
00:10:17.007 --> 00:10:19.227
but I haven't read
about anything like this

204
00:10:19.227 --> 00:10:20.794
in my Naltorian texts.

205
00:10:20.794 --> 00:10:24.319
Well. there's gotta
be a reason for it.

206
00:10:24.319 --> 00:10:26.713
I mean. why did we
suddenly fall asleep?

207
00:10:26.713 --> 00:10:28.149
I don't know.

208
00:10:28.149 --> 00:10:29.803
That's not
our biggest problem. Iris.

209
00:10:29.803 --> 00:10:31.718
I have been trying to wake
us up since we got here.

210
00:10:31.718 --> 00:10:33.502
But without my powers. I can't.

211
00:10:33.502 --> 00:10:35.504
- We're trapped?
- For the time being. yes.

212
00:10:35.504 --> 00:10:38.855
But the good news is.
there's always an exit.

213
00:10:38.855 --> 00:10:40.378
We just have to find it.

214
00:10:43.947 --> 00:10:44.992
Hey. Cap.

215
00:10:44.992 --> 00:10:46.776
Nice takedown earlier.

216
00:10:46.776 --> 00:10:49.344
CCPN is dying
to interview you about it.

217
00:10:49.344 --> 00:10:50.650
that and how you took down

218
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.826
the Snart siblings last week.

219
00:10:52.826 --> 00:10:54.001
You're unstoppable.

220
00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:55.655
Okay. sure.

221
00:10:57.526 --> 00:10:59.397
Wonder what I did
to take down Lisa and Snart.

222
00:10:59.397 --> 00:11:00.877
It doesn't matter.

223
00:11:00.877 --> 00:11:03.358
Look. I know dream lives
can be intriguing.

224
00:11:03.358 --> 00:11:05.708
but we need
to stay focused here.

225
00:11:05.708 --> 00:11:08.668
Okay. it's not safe to stay in
the dream realm for too long.

226
00:11:11.453 --> 00:11:13.194
Let's check up there too.

227
00:11:13.194 --> 00:11:15.152
You know. it's actually nice
to be making the news

228
00:11:15.152 --> 00:11:17.241
instead of just reporting
on it.

229
00:11:17.241 --> 00:11:19.330
This could actually be my life.

230
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.811
But you're such
a talented reporter.

231
00:11:21.811 --> 00:11:23.639
Yeah. but there was
a time when I wanted

232
00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:26.381
to be a cop. just like my dad.

233
00:11:26.381 --> 00:11:28.557
I mean. he was a hero
to so many people.

234
00:11:28.557 --> 00:11:30.385
Does this mean
that being a police officer

235
00:11:30.385 --> 00:11:33.257
is what I should be doing?

236
00:11:39.002 --> 00:11:41.439
Hey. look.
A way out.

237
00:11:41.439 --> 00:11:42.919
Iris.

238
00:11:42.919 --> 00:11:45.139
Iris.
Iris. wait.

239
00:11:45.139 --> 00:11:48.490
I never finished telling you
what happened in my dream.

240
00:11:50.361 --> 00:11:51.798
You died.

241
00:11:55.018 --> 00:11:56.411
How?

242
00:11:56.411 --> 00:11:58.805
You weren't
the only one there.

243
00:11:58.805 --> 00:12:01.068
There was also
this hooded woman.

244
00:12:01.068 --> 00:12:03.157
I didn't see her face.
She didn't speak.

245
00:12:03.157 --> 00:12:06.290
She just looked at me
with these glowing eyes.

246
00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:09.076
I think she's the one
who took away my powers.

247
00:12:09.076 --> 00:12:11.078
And I think
she's the one that killed you.

248
00:12:11.078 --> 00:12:13.776
She's the one you saw
right before we passed out.

249
00:12:13.776 --> 00:12:15.430
She forced us
into your dream.

250
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.258
And now I'm starting
to think that it's because

251
00:12:17.258 --> 00:12:21.088
the only place she can kill
is in the dream realm.

252
00:12:21.088 --> 00:12:23.307
which is why I'm so weirded out
by this door.

253
00:12:23.307 --> 00:12:25.222
Either way.
we need to be careful.

254
00:12:25.222 --> 00:12:28.095
And we need to get out of here
fast. before she finds us.

255
00:12:28.095 --> 00:12:29.661
Let's go wake up.

256
00:12:46.853 --> 00:12:49.420
Renita. double shot
cappuccino. no foam.

257
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.595
with oat milk for Renita.

258
00:12:50.595 --> 00:12:52.772
I am so sorry for the mix-up.

259
00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:54.295
Hey. boss. Nia.

260
00:12:54.295 --> 00:12:56.384
Hi.

261
00:12:56.384 --> 00:12:57.864
Okay.

262
00:12:57.864 --> 00:13:00.736
That definitely wasn't an exit.

263
00:13:00.736 --> 00:13:03.086
Why are we still stuck
in a dream?

264
00:13:09.571 --> 00:13:12.095
Hey. Iris.
I brought cheese fries.

265
00:13:18.972 --> 00:13:20.669
No. no. no. no.

266
00:13:20.669 --> 00:13:22.149
Iris?

267
00:13:23.498 --> 00:13:24.804
Nia.

268
00:13:34.422 --> 00:13:36.032
So what's wrong with them?

269
00:13:36.032 --> 00:13:38.339
According to Gideon's
biometric analysis.

270
00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:40.558
Iris and Nia are
in a deep REM sleep.

271
00:13:40.558 --> 00:13:42.299
But why can't we wake them?

272
00:13:42.299 --> 00:13:44.780
Well. their cortical
functions are totally siloed.

273
00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.087
That's why they won't respond
to any outside stimuli.

274
00:13:47.087 --> 00:13:48.828
What about the baby?
Is Nora okay?

275
00:13:53.136 --> 00:13:54.746
From what I can tell. yeah.

276
00:13:54.746 --> 00:13:56.096
Baby Nora's okay so far.

277
00:13:56.096 --> 00:13:57.793
Cecile.
can you sense anything?

278
00:13:57.793 --> 00:13:59.403
No.

279
00:13:59.403 --> 00:14:00.796
Well. if Nia is here
and they're both asleep--

280
00:14:00.796 --> 00:14:02.450
Then that can't be
a coincidence.

281
00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.539
What about contacting Kara.
or Brainy or J'on?

282
00:14:04.539 --> 00:14:06.106
I mean. they know Nia's powers
better than we do.

283
00:14:06.106 --> 00:14:07.542
Barry. I checked.
They're all off world.

284
00:14:07.542 --> 00:14:08.891
Okay. well. we have
to try something.

285
00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:10.850
I'm gonna--I'm gonna call
the League.

286
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.069
Cisco. Dig.
anyone I can think of.

287
00:14:15.115 --> 00:14:17.508
Okay. I'll go talk to him.

288
00:14:20.729 --> 00:14:22.339
- Oh. man.

289
00:14:22.339 --> 00:14:24.211
The neural functions
in their cerebral cortexes

290
00:14:24.211 --> 00:14:25.647
are sinking fast.

291
00:14:25.647 --> 00:14:27.301
If Iris and Nia
don't wake up soon.

292
00:14:27.301 --> 00:14:29.999
they could fall into
a permanent comatose state.

293
00:14:31.261 --> 00:14:34.961
We are
two badass. smart women.

294
00:14:34.961 --> 00:14:37.789
We can figure this out. right?

295
00:14:37.789 --> 00:14:39.922
Nia. if we can't wake up.

296
00:14:39.922 --> 00:14:41.706
what happens to us
on the outside?

297
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.797
What happens to my baby?
- I don't know.

298
00:14:45.797 --> 00:14:47.799
- Iris. it's happening again.

299
00:14:47.799 --> 00:14:49.540
Hurry. Hurry!
- Okay. the bean--

300
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.673
Bean popper's totally jammed.

301
00:14:51.673 --> 00:14:55.242
Resistor coil is overheating.

302
00:14:55.242 --> 00:14:56.721
It's a Code Sumatra.

303
00:14:56.721 --> 00:14:58.245
- It's a Code Sumatra?
- Hello!

304
00:14:58.245 --> 00:15:00.073
I'd like my coffee
sometime today.

305
00:15:00.073 --> 00:15:01.204
Yes!

306
00:15:01.204 --> 00:15:02.553
Do you know what to do here?

307
00:15:02.553 --> 00:15:04.338
- Um...
- I can't.

308
00:15:04.338 --> 00:15:07.341
I'm so sorry.
Yes. I do.

309
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:08.777
Chester.
- Yeah.

310
00:15:08.777 --> 00:15:10.083
- You know how to fix anything.
- Right.

311
00:15:10.083 --> 00:15:11.780
- Right?
- Right.

312
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.130
Okay. so just imagine that
Jitters is your toolbox.

313
00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.305
It's my toolbox.
Yes. yes. yes.

314
00:15:15.305 --> 00:15:16.654
I could disassemble the--

315
00:15:16.654 --> 00:15:17.786
the space heater
in the storage room.

316
00:15:17.786 --> 00:15:19.744
strip it for parts. yeah.

317
00:15:19.744 --> 00:15:21.616
And the handheld frother
still works. right?

318
00:15:21.616 --> 00:15:23.009
- Yeah.
- We can use that

319
00:15:23.009 --> 00:15:24.401
to finish Marco's order.

320
00:15:24.401 --> 00:15:26.926
On it. babe.
Don't worry.

321
00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:30.973
They call me
the fastest man alive.

322
00:15:30.973 --> 00:15:32.540
How do you know
how to run a coffee shop?

323
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.281
Oh. I used
to be a barista here.

324
00:15:34.281 --> 00:15:37.066
I really loved it.

325
00:15:37.066 --> 00:15:38.807
- Great managing. boss.
- Thanks.

326
00:15:38.807 --> 00:15:41.070
It's almost quitting time.
Want to get dinner?

327
00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.072
Somewhere with cheese fries?

328
00:15:43.072 --> 00:15:44.987
I would love that.

329
00:15:44.987 --> 00:15:46.075
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

330
00:15:46.075 --> 00:15:47.642
- All right.
- Okay.

331
00:15:49.165 --> 00:15:50.210
Okay.

332
00:15:51.515 --> 00:15:53.517
- Is it hot in here?
- No. why?

333
00:15:53.517 --> 00:15:54.605
Marco. it's ready.

334
00:15:54.605 --> 00:15:57.608
Iris. we need to go.

335
00:15:57.608 --> 00:15:58.783
Right now.

336
00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.490
So paintball was interesting.

337
00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:11.361
Don't worry.
We got plenty more stops

338
00:16:11.361 --> 00:16:14.930
on the chill chill chill
train tonight!

339
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.933
Oh. do you like
underground raves?

340
00:16:17.933 --> 00:16:20.370
I love dancing.
but I thought

341
00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.372
maybe we'd do something
a little more relaxing.

342
00:16:22.372 --> 00:16:26.072
something to nurture
the body and soul?

343
00:16:26.072 --> 00:16:27.682
I hear you loud and clear.

344
00:16:27.682 --> 00:16:29.727
Barkeep. some shots. please.

345
00:16:29.727 --> 00:16:32.600
Absolutely.

346
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.733
There are your usuals.
It's good to see you.

347
00:16:35.733 --> 00:16:37.431
Oh. I've never
been here before.

348
00:16:38.649 --> 00:16:40.260
And I don't drink.

349
00:16:41.391 --> 00:16:45.091
So today's
been amazing. right?

350
00:16:45.091 --> 00:16:46.614
Yeah. I was actually thinking

351
00:16:46.614 --> 00:16:48.181
that maybe we could go
to the Arboretum.

352
00:16:48.181 --> 00:16:49.573
I know
they're open late tonight.

353
00:16:49.573 --> 00:16:50.618
Oh. I know.
Why don't we hit up

354
00:16:50.618 --> 00:16:52.402
the midnight roller derby?

355
00:16:52.402 --> 00:16:54.796
What time is it?

356
00:16:54.796 --> 00:16:57.494
Mark. why aren't we doing
anything that I wanna do?

357
00:16:57.494 --> 00:17:00.280
Uh. because we should only
be doing exciting things.

358
00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.325
You know. not walking
around in a garden.

359
00:17:02.325 --> 00:17:03.805
It's--it's boring.

360
00:17:03.805 --> 00:17:05.546
Says who?

361
00:17:05.546 --> 00:17:07.678
Everybody with a pulse!

362
00:17:07.678 --> 00:17:09.463
Can't you be more like...

363
00:17:09.463 --> 00:17:11.204
Frost?

364
00:17:15.295 --> 00:17:18.863
Do you feel hot.
heart racing?

365
00:17:18.863 --> 00:17:20.822
Yeah.
Why?

366
00:17:20.822 --> 00:17:23.346
The Naltorian mystics had
a word for something like this.

367
00:17:23.346 --> 00:17:26.088
It roughly translates
to angry sleep.

368
00:17:26.088 --> 00:17:28.743
Basically. if you stay
in a dream too long.

369
00:17:28.743 --> 00:17:30.571
your body starts
to experience trauma

370
00:17:30.571 --> 00:17:32.312
from the intense strain.

371
00:17:32.312 --> 00:17:34.444
So we're on a clock?

372
00:17:34.444 --> 00:17:36.968
Look. dreams always
reflect back to us

373
00:17:36.968 --> 00:17:38.448
the problems
of our everyday lives.

374
00:17:38.448 --> 00:17:40.102
So maybe if we can

375
00:17:40.102 --> 00:17:42.017
crack the code of your dreams.
we can get out.

376
00:17:42.017 --> 00:17:43.888
Is there anything
that you're struggling with

377
00:17:43.888 --> 00:17:45.499
in the real world?
- No. nothing important.

378
00:17:45.499 --> 00:17:47.196
I mean. I have everything
that I could want.

379
00:17:47.196 --> 00:17:50.069
I--I'm pregnant.
I--my career is taking off.

380
00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:51.113
I have Barry.

381
00:17:51.113 --> 00:17:52.767
There must be something.

382
00:17:55.161 --> 00:17:56.640
I don't know.
I--I don't know

383
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.381
what to tell you.
I guess back at Jitters.

384
00:17:58.381 --> 00:18:01.819
I felt something
that I haven't felt in years.

385
00:18:01.819 --> 00:18:03.473
Being in a world
where I could clock out

386
00:18:03.473 --> 00:18:04.866
at 5:00. it was nice.

387
00:18:04.866 --> 00:18:06.389
I could choose
how to spend my day.

388
00:18:06.389 --> 00:18:07.956
my evenings. my future.

389
00:18:07.956 --> 00:18:09.914
Maybe I just wish
that I could always

390
00:18:09.914 --> 00:18:11.177
feel that kind of freedom.

391
00:18:13.701 --> 00:18:15.311
What is it?

392
00:18:22.492 --> 00:18:24.320
What just happened?
- This room.

393
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.888
- Where are we?
- This room.

394
00:18:26.888 --> 00:18:28.324
it was in my dream.

395
00:18:28.324 --> 00:18:31.980
I think our dreams are merging.

396
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.896
No. this can't happen.
not here. not now.

397
00:18:34.896 --> 00:18:37.159
- Nia. is this where--
- I saw you die.

398
00:18:37.159 --> 00:18:39.683
Iris. we're not sharing
a dream anymore.

399
00:18:39.683 --> 00:18:40.902
We're sharing a nightmare.

400
00:18:40.902 --> 00:18:42.947
Run!

401
00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.304
- Their fevers are spiking.

402
00:18:51.304 --> 00:18:53.697
104. 104.2.
They keep going up.

403
00:18:53.697 --> 00:18:55.351
- Why is this happening?
- I don't know.

404
00:18:55.351 --> 00:18:58.180
But if their body temps
keep getting higher--

405
00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.269
We should get Barry.
He--he needs to be here.

406
00:19:00.269 --> 00:19:02.053
Yeah. I know.
but what are we

407
00:19:02.053 --> 00:19:03.620
supposed to tell him.
that it's hopeless?

408
00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:04.795
He's gonna lose everything?

409
00:19:04.795 --> 00:19:06.623
Hey. it's gonna be okay.

410
00:19:06.623 --> 00:19:07.885
Are you sure?

411
00:19:07.885 --> 00:19:09.191
Because I'm not.

412
00:19:30.473 --> 00:19:32.040
There's no way
they could have caught up

413
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.650
with us that fast.
- No rules in a nightmare.

414
00:19:38.916 --> 00:19:41.658
Nia. is that the woman
from your dreams?

415
00:19:41.658 --> 00:19:42.746
Yup.

416
00:19:44.008 --> 00:19:45.706
Why are you doing this to us?

417
00:19:51.015 --> 00:19:53.148
Enough of this!

418
00:19:53.148 --> 00:19:55.019
I am the Dreamer.
I am in control.

419
00:19:55.019 --> 00:19:56.673
And I am not gonna
let you hurt her!

420
00:20:06.466 --> 00:20:08.250
I thought
she was gonna kill us.

421
00:20:10.774 --> 00:20:12.036
Wait.
Are we back?

422
00:20:12.036 --> 00:20:13.647
No.

423
00:20:13.647 --> 00:20:16.476
I can sense we're still
in the dream realm.

424
00:20:16.476 --> 00:20:18.913
It looks like
she doesn't want us to leave.

425
00:20:18.913 --> 00:20:20.131
There are people around here

426
00:20:20.131 --> 00:20:23.178
who actually do the work.
you know?

427
00:20:23.178 --> 00:20:26.007
She gets everything handed
to her on a silver platter.

428
00:20:26.007 --> 00:20:28.966
Must be nice.

429
00:20:28.966 --> 00:20:30.533
Aariz.
who are you talking about?

430
00:20:30.533 --> 00:20:32.405
She's a total fraud.

431
00:20:32.405 --> 00:20:34.145
I've been saying it
since day one.

432
00:20:34.145 --> 00:20:36.539
<i>And now accepting
the Pulitzer Prize</i>

433
00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:39.455
<i>for Investigative Journalism.
Iris West-Allen.</i>

434
00:20:39.455 --> 00:20:41.327
<i>Congratulations.</i>
- They're talking about me.

435
00:20:41.327 --> 00:20:42.850
Iris. don't listen.

436
00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.243
I mean. a Pulitzer?

437
00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:45.809
Seriously? For what?

438
00:20:45.809 --> 00:20:48.029
Being married to the Flash?

439
00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:49.770
Because that's
how she gets all her stories.

440
00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:51.511
Allegra.
you're a straight shooter.

441
00:20:51.511 --> 00:20:53.034
What's your take?

442
00:20:53.034 --> 00:20:54.862
Yeah. I've known Iris
for a long time.

443
00:20:54.862 --> 00:20:57.343
which means I know exactly
what kind of person she is.

444
00:20:58.996 --> 00:21:00.128
She's a fake.

445
00:21:00.128 --> 00:21:01.869
She doesn't have a life.

446
00:21:01.869 --> 00:21:03.436
She has a checklist.

447
00:21:03.436 --> 00:21:05.089
Everything's
already decided for her.

448
00:21:05.089 --> 00:21:06.439
There is no way

449
00:21:06.439 --> 00:21:08.179
she actually
deserves this award.

450
00:21:19.495 --> 00:21:20.975
Khione. wait.

451
00:21:20.975 --> 00:21:23.282
Khione.

452
00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:25.196
Mark. do you wish
that I was Frost?

453
00:21:25.196 --> 00:21:27.286
No. Why?
Why would I want that?

454
00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:30.071
Okay.
it's karaoke time. folks.

455
00:21:30.071 --> 00:21:32.291
- It's not...
- Yeah!

456
00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:35.555
In the house
for the first time in months.

457
00:21:35.555 --> 00:21:38.906
welcome back the Icepack.

458
00:21:38.906 --> 00:21:44.694
all: Icepack. Icepack. Icepack.
Icepack. Icepack. Icepack!

459
00:21:44.694 --> 00:21:46.870
Mark!
Frost. yeah?

460
00:21:48.785 --> 00:21:51.179
all: Icepack. Icepack.
Icepack. Icepack. Icepack!

461
00:21:51.179 --> 00:21:52.659
Thank you.

462
00:21:52.659 --> 00:21:54.574
Thank you. everyone.
for your kindness.

463
00:21:54.574 --> 00:21:57.272
Unfortunately. Frost and Mark
will not be singing tonight

464
00:21:57.272 --> 00:21:58.491
because Frost is dead.

465
00:21:58.491 --> 00:22:00.493
- Wait. what?
- Seriously?

466
00:22:00.493 --> 00:22:02.799
And he has a lot
of explaining to do.

467
00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:05.367
all: Oh!

468
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.111
It all makes sense.

469
00:22:10.111 --> 00:22:14.637
You've been trying to turn me
into Frost since day one.

470
00:22:14.637 --> 00:22:18.119
first with the CRC and now
with everything we did today.

471
00:22:18.119 --> 00:22:20.426
I can explain.
I--I just miss her so much.

472
00:22:20.426 --> 00:22:22.602
I'm not thinking straight.
- Oh. come on.

473
00:22:22.602 --> 00:22:24.343
I thought
you were a real friend.

474
00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:25.822
I am.

475
00:22:25.822 --> 00:22:27.911
I'm just saying
that I could be more.

476
00:22:27.911 --> 00:22:29.304
Yikes. man.

477
00:22:29.304 --> 00:22:31.306
Mark.
we barely know each other.

478
00:22:31.306 --> 00:22:33.221
- Yeah. you tell him!
- Okay. I had a dream.

479
00:22:33.221 --> 00:22:34.701
A dream?

480
00:22:34.701 --> 00:22:35.919
You were in it.
and we kissed.

481
00:22:35.919 --> 00:22:37.486
And it was amazing.

482
00:22:37.486 --> 00:22:39.053
And the chemistry
was off the frickin' charts.

483
00:22:39.053 --> 00:22:41.055
Take it outside.
No one wants to hear this.

484
00:22:41.055 --> 00:22:42.491
Oh. right?

485
00:22:42.491 --> 00:22:44.145
So sue me!

486
00:22:44.145 --> 00:22:45.973
Sue me if I just wanted to see

487
00:22:45.973 --> 00:22:47.366
if this could be
the real thing.

488
00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:49.368
Don't you ever
talk to me like that.

489
00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:50.978
But no. you're right.

490
00:22:50.978 --> 00:22:52.153
Clearly. you're not
the woman of my dreams.

491
00:22:52.153 --> 00:22:53.850
because you're not Frost.

492
00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:54.982
Oh...

493
00:22:54.982 --> 00:22:56.070
Stop.

494
00:22:57.506 --> 00:23:00.291
No. I'm me.

495
00:23:00.291 --> 00:23:01.902
But you wouldn't know anything
about me.

496
00:23:01.902 --> 00:23:05.340
because you never even tried
to get to know me.

497
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.479
And now I'm leaving.

498
00:23:27.144 --> 00:23:30.844
So we're stuck in a dream.

499
00:23:30.844 --> 00:23:34.543
Our bodies are dangerously
close to overheating.

500
00:23:34.543 --> 00:23:37.372
And you're worried
about an award?

501
00:23:39.722 --> 00:23:41.898
Yeah. I know.
It's stupid.

502
00:23:44.074 --> 00:23:46.773
So talk to me.

503
00:23:46.773 --> 00:23:48.252
What's going on?

504
00:23:48.252 --> 00:23:52.082
Well. um.
right before you got here.

505
00:23:52.082 --> 00:23:53.910
I found out that
the article that I'm writing

506
00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:57.044
is gonna win me
my first Pulitzer.

507
00:23:57.044 --> 00:23:59.699
Hazards of being married
to a time traveler:

508
00:23:59.699 --> 00:24:01.788
I know way more about my future
than most people.

509
00:24:03.224 --> 00:24:04.791
But usually.

510
00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:07.489
that kind of recognition
is great for journalists.

511
00:24:07.489 --> 00:24:08.925
Why is it
bothering you so much?

512
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.539
Well. suddenly it didn't
feel like it was my own.

513
00:24:13.539 --> 00:24:16.629
It felt like
it was preordained.

514
00:24:16.629 --> 00:24:18.239
like I didn't earn it.

515
00:24:18.239 --> 00:24:20.328
So that's why you've
been dreaming of lives

516
00:24:20.328 --> 00:24:22.112
with no preordained destiny.

517
00:24:24.201 --> 00:24:25.812
Where I can make
my own choices.

518
00:24:25.812 --> 00:24:31.034
But. Iris.

519
00:24:31.034 --> 00:24:35.038
you've already been
making your own choices.

520
00:24:35.038 --> 00:24:39.129
You're worried
about publishing today

521
00:24:39.129 --> 00:24:40.957
because it leads
to your first Pulitzer.

522
00:24:40.957 --> 00:24:42.785
but that was a choice
you made years ago.

523
00:24:42.785 --> 00:24:44.395
when you decided
to become a journalist

524
00:24:44.395 --> 00:24:46.572
in the first place.

525
00:24:46.572 --> 00:24:47.921
Don't you see?

526
00:24:47.921 --> 00:24:50.706
Every time
you're pursuing a lead

527
00:24:50.706 --> 00:24:52.665
or staying up all night.

528
00:24:52.665 --> 00:24:54.841
digging into a story--

529
00:24:54.841 --> 00:24:58.192
I'm doubling down
on that choice.

530
00:24:58.192 --> 00:25:00.020
And that's the thing
about destiny.

531
00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.283
It isn't just one choice.

532
00:25:02.283 --> 00:25:06.374
Destiny is the culmination
of a lifetime of choices.

533
00:25:08.768 --> 00:25:11.031
You're always
on the right path. Iris.

534
00:25:12.946 --> 00:25:14.730
And I created it.

535
00:25:19.169 --> 00:25:21.781
Nia. if we've cracked
the meaning of my dreams.

536
00:25:21.781 --> 00:25:23.478
then why are we still here?

537
00:25:25.567 --> 00:25:26.742
What was that?

538
00:25:26.742 --> 00:25:30.398
Only one way to find out.

539
00:25:31.704 --> 00:25:33.532
Their fevers aren't breaking.

540
00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:35.316
They're at 105.2.

541
00:25:35.316 --> 00:25:37.666
And there's
nothing we can do?

542
00:25:37.666 --> 00:25:39.581
Pretty soon. their organs
are gonna shut down.

543
00:25:39.581 --> 00:25:42.279
And if that happens.

544
00:25:42.279 --> 00:25:44.194
we could lose both of them.

545
00:25:44.194 --> 00:25:45.369
And our baby too.

546
00:26:02.909 --> 00:26:04.911
I can't believe
this is happening.

547
00:26:08.218 --> 00:26:10.046
Cecile. what is it?

548
00:26:14.268 --> 00:26:15.922
There's someone else here.

549
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.320
Who is it?

550
00:26:28.195 --> 00:26:31.198
I don't know.
They're gone.

551
00:26:33.504 --> 00:26:37.421
Barry. I don't know why.
and there is

552
00:26:37.421 --> 00:26:40.337
no rational explanation
for me feeling this way.

553
00:26:40.337 --> 00:26:45.212
but I know that Iris
is gonna pull through this.

554
00:26:45.212 --> 00:26:46.648
She's gonna be fine.

555
00:26:46.648 --> 00:26:49.433
She and Nia
are both gonna be okay.

556
00:26:50.739 --> 00:26:53.742
How can you be so sure?

557
00:26:53.742 --> 00:26:55.570
Because the presence
that I just felt

558
00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:58.747
was something
powerful and kind.

559
00:27:00.314 --> 00:27:02.621
It was almost like
a guardian angel.

560
00:27:04.797 --> 00:27:07.016
Barry. I think it was a sign.

561
00:27:21.552 --> 00:27:23.424
What is all that?

562
00:27:23.424 --> 00:27:25.165
Spiderwebs.

563
00:27:26.427 --> 00:27:29.648
A spider bite killed my mom.

564
00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:31.171
She was a Dreamer too.

565
00:27:34.087 --> 00:27:35.436
What do you want to do?

566
00:27:41.442 --> 00:27:43.226
Nia. look.

567
00:27:43.226 --> 00:27:45.881
I know you're trying to
regain control of your powers

568
00:27:45.881 --> 00:27:51.234
and this dream that we're in.

569
00:27:51.234 --> 00:27:53.846
but what if you're
not supposed to?

570
00:27:55.804 --> 00:27:58.502
Something that's always
guided me as a journalist

571
00:27:58.502 --> 00:28:01.375
is that in order
to honor the truth.

572
00:28:01.375 --> 00:28:03.203
you can't control it.

573
00:28:03.203 --> 00:28:07.381
You just have to follow
the story and engage with it.

574
00:28:07.381 --> 00:28:09.688
even if where it leads you
is scary.

575
00:28:12.603 --> 00:28:16.129
Before I came
to Central City.

576
00:28:16.129 --> 00:28:18.653
when I saw you in my dream.
you said to me.

577
00:28:18.653 --> 00:28:21.134
"It's about control."

578
00:28:22.875 --> 00:28:24.398
This whole time.
I thought you were

579
00:28:24.398 --> 00:28:26.052
telling me to take control.

580
00:28:26.052 --> 00:28:29.403
But now I know what you meant.

581
00:28:30.665 --> 00:28:32.406
This is about me
giving up control.

582
00:28:34.016 --> 00:28:40.283
Iris. I think I have to go
through this door alone.

583
00:28:40.283 --> 00:28:42.764
even if where it leads
is scary.

584
00:28:42.764 --> 00:28:44.157
Are you sure?

585
00:28:46.028 --> 00:28:48.248
The only reason I can
is because of you.

586
00:29:41.692 --> 00:29:43.694
Iris. it's time
for you to come home.

587
00:29:46.828 --> 00:29:49.396
We can't live this life
without you.

588
00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.228
You got this. Nia.

589
00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:49.630
You've been trying
to guide us this whole time.

590
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:50.849
haven't you?

591
00:30:53.808 --> 00:30:56.593
I thought
that I'd mastered my powers.

592
00:30:56.593 --> 00:30:58.682
that I was in full control
as the Dreamer.

593
00:30:58.682 --> 00:31:01.033
But the truth was. I wasn't
ready to do what I had to do

594
00:31:01.033 --> 00:31:03.035
to reach a higher level.

595
00:31:03.035 --> 00:31:05.341
I'm ready to give up control.

596
00:31:07.387 --> 00:31:09.911
And I accept
whatever comes next.

597
00:31:28.016 --> 00:31:30.758
I know who you are.

598
00:31:30.758 --> 00:31:34.153
My mother was
the Dreamer before me.

599
00:31:34.153 --> 00:31:38.722
and her mother before her.

600
00:31:38.722 --> 00:31:41.029
all the way back to you.

601
00:31:43.336 --> 00:31:45.381
You are the original Dreamer.

602
00:31:45.381 --> 00:31:47.688
You are the ancient source
of Naltorian dream energy

603
00:31:47.688 --> 00:31:49.864
I've been looking for.

604
00:31:49.864 --> 00:31:53.737
That's why you had
to bring me and Iris together.

605
00:31:53.737 --> 00:31:56.349
It was the only way for us
to embrace our paths.

606
00:32:24.159 --> 00:32:25.334
You're back.

607
00:32:26.466 --> 00:32:28.424
- It's okay.
- Oh. thank God.

608
00:32:28.424 --> 00:32:30.078
Whoa.
Check this out.

609
00:32:30.078 --> 00:32:31.906
Their temperatures are
already back to normal.

610
00:32:31.906 --> 00:32:33.821
Same with their cortical
and neural functions.

611
00:32:33.821 --> 00:32:36.128
Like nothing ever happened.

612
00:32:36.128 --> 00:32:37.781
Nia.

613
00:32:40.262 --> 00:32:42.221
We're awake. aren't we?

614
00:32:42.221 --> 00:32:43.657
Yeah.

615
00:32:43.657 --> 00:32:44.919
We're awake.

616
00:33:04.895 --> 00:33:06.245
Nia. I don't know
how to thank you

617
00:33:06.245 --> 00:33:07.333
for saving my family.

618
00:33:07.333 --> 00:33:08.464
You really don't have to.

619
00:33:08.464 --> 00:33:10.379
Honestly. Iris saved me.

620
00:33:10.379 --> 00:33:12.207
When my powers
started fritzing.

621
00:33:12.207 --> 00:33:15.297
I thought that I was losing
my path as the Dreamer.

622
00:33:15.297 --> 00:33:17.386
so I held on tighter.

623
00:33:17.386 --> 00:33:20.868
But Iris helped me realize
that giving up control

624
00:33:20.868 --> 00:33:22.565
was what I needed
to do all along.

625
00:33:22.565 --> 00:33:25.873
Turns out. we were
both on the right path.

626
00:33:25.873 --> 00:33:29.485
We just needed
to adjust our perspectives.

627
00:33:29.485 --> 00:33:33.620
So that presence
that I felt. who is she?

628
00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:36.971
She is the first woman
on my mother's planet Naltor

629
00:33:36.971 --> 00:33:39.234
to receive the dreaming gift.

630
00:33:39.234 --> 00:33:40.670
She's the one
I've been looking for.

631
00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:43.325
I just didn't realize it.

632
00:33:43.325 --> 00:33:45.023
And now that I've connected
with her.

633
00:33:45.023 --> 00:33:47.373
she is going to teach me
to use my powers

634
00:33:47.373 --> 00:33:49.462
in all new ways.

635
00:33:49.462 --> 00:33:51.768
So it turns out
that my potential

636
00:33:51.768 --> 00:33:54.597
is beyond my wildest dreams.

637
00:33:54.597 --> 00:33:56.208
Wow.
Okay.

638
00:33:56.208 --> 00:34:01.604
See. now. that is
cosmic. cosmic. cosmic.

639
00:34:01.604 --> 00:34:03.867
Don't mind him.
He's always like this.

640
00:34:03.867 --> 00:34:05.521
Just the way I like him.

641
00:34:05.521 --> 00:34:07.262
Okay.
now I really miss Brainy.

642
00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:12.528
That is weird.

643
00:34:12.528 --> 00:34:14.704
It's like
I can feel the presence

644
00:34:14.704 --> 00:34:18.056
of the original Dreamer
all over again.

645
00:34:18.056 --> 00:34:20.058
There's so much love.

646
00:34:20.058 --> 00:34:21.711
She's right over there.

647
00:34:21.711 --> 00:34:22.799
Hmm?

648
00:34:27.108 --> 00:34:28.327
I'm the only one
who can see her.

649
00:34:28.327 --> 00:34:30.503
I'm not crazy.

650
00:34:30.503 --> 00:34:33.767
Well. tell her thank you.

651
00:34:33.767 --> 00:34:35.638
She says you're welcome.

652
00:34:38.163 --> 00:34:41.296
And now she's gone again.
isn't she?

653
00:34:41.296 --> 00:34:43.211
And I should get going too.

654
00:34:43.211 --> 00:34:46.127
It has been a long night.

655
00:34:46.127 --> 00:34:49.348
Well. I'll see you
at next month's brunch club?

656
00:34:49.348 --> 00:34:50.827
Definitely.

657
00:34:52.786 --> 00:34:55.963
And congratulations.
Ms. Pulitzer.

658
00:34:55.963 --> 00:34:58.139
Thanks.

659
00:34:58.139 --> 00:34:59.575
Bye. guys.

660
00:35:10.325 --> 00:35:12.153
Whoo.
Nia was right.

661
00:35:12.153 --> 00:35:13.807
Big Belly
in National City is better.

662
00:35:13.807 --> 00:35:15.461
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks for running

663
00:35:15.461 --> 00:35:17.941
all the way to get it.
- Anytime.

664
00:35:17.941 --> 00:35:20.422
So do you want to get cozy.
watch a movie?

665
00:35:20.422 --> 00:35:23.033
Oh. you had me at cozy!

666
00:35:23.033 --> 00:35:27.125
But there is one thing
I still need to do first.

667
00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:35.872
- Iris. that's--
- Yeah. I know.

668
00:35:35.872 --> 00:35:38.658
I've been struggling over
whether or not to publish it.

669
00:35:40.268 --> 00:35:43.184
You don't have to do this.
We already decided

670
00:35:43.184 --> 00:35:44.620
to let the rest of our future
be unwritten.

671
00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.145
Yeah. I know.

672
00:35:47.145 --> 00:35:49.364
And we will.

673
00:35:49.364 --> 00:35:52.802
It's just that
being a journalist.

674
00:35:52.802 --> 00:35:55.370
my future isn't unwritten.

675
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:58.025
And that has nothing to do
with the Mapbook

676
00:35:58.025 --> 00:36:03.509
or anything that Deon
or Bart or Nora has said.

677
00:36:03.509 --> 00:36:06.164
It's because
I've been writing it all along.

678
00:36:22.832 --> 00:36:25.313
Cecile. this food
looks incredible.

679
00:36:25.313 --> 00:36:26.706
Yeah. no. seriously.
You could feed

680
00:36:26.706 --> 00:36:28.360
half of Central City
with this spread.

681
00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.363
Well. no one.
and I mean no one.

682
00:36:31.363 --> 00:36:33.321
goes hungry in our house.

683
00:36:33.321 --> 00:36:34.931
Oh. my God. I'm turning
into my grandmother.

684
00:36:34.931 --> 00:36:38.108
Okay. this cheesy
sausage and egg casserole

685
00:36:38.108 --> 00:36:39.675
is her recipe. Enjoy.

686
00:36:39.675 --> 00:36:41.286
Who needs cheesy fries
when you have that?

687
00:36:41.286 --> 00:36:42.939
Ditto that.
I'm gonna need that recipe.

688
00:36:42.939 --> 00:36:44.289
Is it like a family secret?

689
00:36:44.289 --> 00:36:46.334
I know people.
I'll get it for you.

690
00:36:46.334 --> 00:36:47.596
Can we do this every week?

691
00:36:47.596 --> 00:36:49.294
And I don't just mean the food.

692
00:36:49.294 --> 00:36:51.078
This just is so wonderful.

693
00:36:51.078 --> 00:36:52.949
Thank you all
for making me feel at home.

694
00:36:52.949 --> 00:36:55.343
Of course. You're part
of this family now too.

695
00:36:57.911 --> 00:36:59.434
Are we expecting
someone else?

696
00:36:59.434 --> 00:37:01.219
- Mm-mm.
- I am.

697
00:37:09.314 --> 00:37:10.489
Hey.

698
00:37:13.883 --> 00:37:14.884
Hi.

699
00:37:14.884 --> 00:37:17.539
all: Hey.
- Hey. man.

700
00:37:17.539 --> 00:37:19.715
Don't worry.
Since I'm guessing

701
00:37:19.715 --> 00:37:21.891
Khione already told you
what happened.

702
00:37:21.891 --> 00:37:23.371
I won't come in.

703
00:37:28.637 --> 00:37:30.030
I'll be right back.

704
00:37:37.211 --> 00:37:39.082
Thanks
for letting me drop by.

705
00:37:42.782 --> 00:37:45.567
Look. I know
what I did to you was wrong

706
00:37:45.567 --> 00:37:47.743
and seriously screwed up.

707
00:37:48.788 --> 00:37:50.268
For whatever it's worth.

708
00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:52.052
Frost was supposed
to be my ride or die.

709
00:37:52.052 --> 00:37:56.535
you know.
my destiny.

710
00:37:56.535 --> 00:37:58.972
Ever since she's been gone.
it's like I'm stuck

711
00:37:58.972 --> 00:38:01.453
in some bad dream.

712
00:38:01.453 --> 00:38:03.672
And I can't wake up.

713
00:38:12.638 --> 00:38:15.380
But the truth is. there
is no waking up from this.

714
00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:17.686
And now it's got me
hurting everyone around me.

715
00:38:17.686 --> 00:38:19.514
just like I hurt you.

716
00:38:23.301 --> 00:38:30.220
So I just wanted
to come by to say that...

717
00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:32.745
I'm really sorry. Khione.

718
00:38:32.745 --> 00:38:34.442
I wasn't thinking right.

719
00:38:34.442 --> 00:38:36.226
And I totally understand
if you never want to see me.

720
00:38:36.226 --> 00:38:38.533
Mark. I forgive you.

721
00:38:42.711 --> 00:38:46.106
You--really?

722
00:38:46.106 --> 00:38:47.629
Yes.

723
00:38:47.629 --> 00:38:49.414
That's what friends do.

724
00:38:56.812 --> 00:38:59.511
I'm really gonna miss you.

725
00:38:59.511 --> 00:39:02.644
Where are you going?

726
00:39:02.644 --> 00:39:05.038
Away.

727
00:39:05.038 --> 00:39:08.041
You taught me
one other important thing:

728
00:39:08.041 --> 00:39:13.351
no one can take away this pain.
not even you.

729
00:39:15.178 --> 00:39:17.920
So in order to get over it

730
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.748
and learn to live
with whatever it is.

731
00:39:19.748 --> 00:39:23.665
I need to go through it.

732
00:39:23.665 --> 00:39:26.581
all of it.

733
00:39:26.581 --> 00:39:27.930
Alone.

734
00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:38.027
Hey. promise me you'll
keep exploring your powers.

735
00:39:38.027 --> 00:39:41.291
Khione. there has got to be

736
00:39:41.291 --> 00:39:43.511
something amazing
inside of you.

737
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.647
I promise.

738
00:39:54.653 --> 00:39:55.871
Okay.

739
00:40:01.529 --> 00:40:02.661
Yeah.

740
00:40:19.504 --> 00:40:21.984
Khione. honey. you okay?

741
00:40:24.683 --> 00:40:26.902
I'm fine.

742
00:40:26.902 --> 00:40:28.513
Are you sure?

743
00:40:33.343 --> 00:40:34.388
Oh!

744
00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:41.351
I guess
I am feeling a little sad.

745
00:41:18.824 --> 00:41:20.347
Greg. move your head!
