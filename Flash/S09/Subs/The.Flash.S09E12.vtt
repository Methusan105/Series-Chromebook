1
00:00:16.886 --> 00:00:19.541
Do you believe me now?

2
00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:22.283
This is impossible.

3
00:00:22.283 --> 00:00:24.546
Eddie?

4
00:00:24.546 --> 00:00:27.418
I shot myself
with this bullet.

5
00:00:27.418 --> 00:00:29.377
I need to find out
what happened.

6
00:00:29.377 --> 00:00:31.031
I need to know how I'm alive.

7
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.338
Listen.

8
00:00:34.338 --> 00:00:37.689
I believe you. but this city is
a lightning rod for insanity.

9
00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:40.083
You could be a clone
or a cyborg.

10
00:00:40.083 --> 00:00:41.563
We need to get you
to a hospital

11
00:00:41.563 --> 00:00:42.738
and get you checked out.

12
00:00:42.738 --> 00:00:45.523
No. I need to find the Flash.

13
00:00:45.523 --> 00:00:48.135
He'll know what's going on.
- No. listen.

14
00:00:48.135 --> 00:00:50.485
We can't jump to conclusions
without investigating.

15
00:00:50.485 --> 00:00:52.313
If you're really Eddie.
then you're a detective.

16
00:00:52.313 --> 00:00:53.705
and you know this.

17
00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:55.185
If?

18
00:00:55.185 --> 00:00:57.709
I am Eddie Thawne!

19
00:00:57.709 --> 00:01:01.191
I'm alive.
and I need to know why!

20
00:01:03.324 --> 00:01:05.500
What the hell?

21
00:01:07.937 --> 00:01:10.374
Korber!

22
00:01:44.713 --> 00:01:46.541
How nuts is this?

23
00:01:46.541 --> 00:01:48.238
The Negative Speed
Force is attacking us

24
00:01:48.238 --> 00:01:50.936
across space and time?

25
00:01:50.936 --> 00:01:53.461
Hey. Khione.
How's Iris holding up?

26
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:55.245
Allegra's with her
at the hospital.

27
00:01:55.245 --> 00:01:57.334
says she's safe and her
contractions are steady.

28
00:01:57.334 --> 00:02:00.120
I told Allegra to tell Iris
that we will find Barry

29
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.295
before that baby's born.

30
00:02:01.295 --> 00:02:02.644
Good call.

31
00:02:02.644 --> 00:02:04.341
She's got enough
on her mind already.

32
00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:05.777
Ah!

33
00:02:08.345 --> 00:02:09.912
Wow.

34
00:02:09.912 --> 00:02:12.306
I just got hit
with a huge wave of terror.

35
00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:16.266
Nora. what's wrong?

36
00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:19.182
The Negative Speed Force.

37
00:02:19.182 --> 00:02:22.272
It cloaked Barry
with its own dark energy.

38
00:02:22.272 --> 00:02:24.100
The cobalt radiation.

39
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.320
We found it in the loft
when Barry disappeared.

40
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.279
And now it's causing him
to bounce across time.

41
00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:31.977
I briefly sensed him
through the radiation.

42
00:02:31.977 --> 00:02:36.243
I'm not sure how long it
will take him to get there.

43
00:02:36.243 --> 00:02:39.246
but he's heading toward 2049.

44
00:02:39.246 --> 00:02:40.769
First he was taken
to the past.

45
00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.249
then forced to the present--

46
00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:44.120
And now he's going
to the future.

47
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.949
And so is the crystal.

48
00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:49.386
It'll choose another victim
and attack Barry--

49
00:02:53.042 --> 00:02:55.175
I can't help him anymore.

50
00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:56.567
Only you can.

51
00:02:56.567 --> 00:02:58.090
How?

52
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.006
You have to find a way.

53
00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:05.402
If Barry dies and the Speed
Force is extinguished.

54
00:03:05.402 --> 00:03:08.362
then this timeline
and everything in it

55
00:03:08.362 --> 00:03:11.147
will be erased forever.

56
00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:20.548
<i>Whoo!
All right. party people!</i>

57
00:03:20.548 --> 00:03:22.158
That's a wrap.

58
00:03:22.158 --> 00:03:24.639
The Chronarch is no
longer the monarch.

59
00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.423
Come on home.

60
00:03:28.295 --> 00:03:29.948
Was that schway or what?

61
00:03:29.948 --> 00:03:32.777
Not bad for your first
mission as team leader.

62
00:03:32.777 --> 00:03:34.866
I know your dad's all
the way in outer space.

63
00:03:34.866 --> 00:03:38.305
but I can feel how proud he
is of you from the Watchtower.

64
00:03:38.305 --> 00:03:40.132
I mean. that was fun.

65
00:03:40.132 --> 00:03:42.178
But I'm ready for Dad
to come home.

66
00:03:42.178 --> 00:03:43.788
Hey. babe.

67
00:03:43.788 --> 00:03:45.355
The way you went supernova
on him at the end?

68
00:03:45.355 --> 00:03:46.835
It's like you were trying
to blast that man

69
00:03:46.835 --> 00:03:48.228
into the 64th century.

70
00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:49.838
Well. actually.
that's exactly

71
00:03:49.838 --> 00:03:50.969
what I was trying to do.

72
00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.189
- Of course.
- Of course.

73
00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.147
I think it's adorable
that after all

74
00:03:55.147 --> 00:03:58.586
of these years of marriage.
you two still have that spark.

75
00:03:58.586 --> 00:04:00.762
Oh. speaking of spark. Chester.

76
00:04:00.762 --> 00:04:03.199
how's the nano-welding coming
along on my new super suit?

77
00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:04.896
Oh. it should be ready
this afternoon.

78
00:04:08.335 --> 00:04:11.512
I swear. if our big bad has
escaped from ARGUS already--

79
00:04:11.512 --> 00:04:14.384
Oh. no. no. it's an energy
surge coming from upstairs

80
00:04:14.384 --> 00:04:16.125
at the Flash Museum.

81
00:04:16.125 --> 00:04:18.127
I told you it wasn't
a good idea to put a museum

82
00:04:18.127 --> 00:04:19.868
on top of our secret lair.

83
00:04:19.868 --> 00:04:21.652
No. baby. It's genius.

84
00:04:21.652 --> 00:04:24.786
Who'd look for the Flash
under his own museum?

85
00:04:33.751 --> 00:04:35.057
I know
this might sound weird.

86
00:04:35.057 --> 00:04:38.495
but I'm looking for the Flash.

87
00:04:38.495 --> 00:04:40.062
You're in luck.

88
00:04:40.062 --> 00:04:41.846
He's right there.

89
00:04:45.894 --> 00:04:48.288
<i>The Flash
battled numerous threats</i>

90
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:51.813
<i>to our city. but the Flash's
greatest nemesis was</i>

91
00:04:51.813 --> 00:04:56.165
<i>the murderous speedster known
only as the Reverse-Flash.</i>

92
00:04:56.165 --> 00:05:00.038
<i>who returned to Central City
time and time again.</i>

93
00:05:00.038 --> 00:05:02.780
What?
This can't be right.

94
00:05:04.173 --> 00:05:05.827
If Eddie dies.
he'll never be born.

95
00:05:05.827 --> 00:05:07.524
He's being erased
from existence.

96
00:05:09.134 --> 00:05:10.658
It didn't happen like this.

97
00:05:10.658 --> 00:05:14.052
I saw the Reverse-Flash die.

98
00:05:14.052 --> 00:05:15.358
I killed him.

99
00:05:15.358 --> 00:05:17.317
I died a hero.

100
00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:18.405
Dad!

101
00:05:18.405 --> 00:05:20.842
Oh. my God. I found you.

102
00:05:22.278 --> 00:05:23.888
Who are you?

103
00:05:23.888 --> 00:05:26.543
It's me. Dad.

104
00:05:26.543 --> 00:05:29.329
I'm your daughter.

105
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.941
That can't be.

106
00:05:32.941 --> 00:05:36.161
I don't have a daughter.

107
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:40.949
But you've always wanted
to have one. and now you can.

108
00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:48.130
All you have to do
is come with me.

109
00:05:50.437 --> 00:05:52.743
Whoa.

110
00:05:52.743 --> 00:05:55.877
OK. this energy signature
just spiked through the roof.

111
00:05:55.877 --> 00:05:57.618
I'll go check it out.

112
00:06:07.018 --> 00:06:08.933
Sir. are you OK?
- What?

113
00:06:08.933 --> 00:06:11.849
What just happened?

114
00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:14.199
Oh. my God.

115
00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.853
Eddie?

116
00:06:15.853 --> 00:06:17.681
Eddie Thawne?

117
00:06:35.656 --> 00:06:37.614
This is insane.

118
00:06:37.614 --> 00:06:40.051
Eddie Thawne died 34 years ago.

119
00:06:40.051 --> 00:06:42.227
How is he alive.
and why hasn't he aged a day?

120
00:06:42.227 --> 00:06:44.229
And why is he here?

121
00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:48.233
I have no idea. but all
his fingerprints and DNA match.

122
00:06:48.233 --> 00:06:50.192
Except he is giving
off high levels

123
00:06:50.192 --> 00:06:52.281
of Hawking radiation--
the kind you only

124
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:54.065
find inside singularities.

125
00:06:54.065 --> 00:06:57.286
So you think Eddie's
causing these portals to open?

126
00:06:57.286 --> 00:06:59.680
Maybe it's subconscious.

127
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.465
Maybe it's his emotions
triggering them.

128
00:07:02.465 --> 00:07:04.772
Oh. I was a black hole once.

129
00:07:04.772 --> 00:07:06.513
It happens.

130
00:07:06.513 --> 00:07:08.036
You know what?

131
00:07:08.036 --> 00:07:09.951
I think that I could
work up a cuff for him--

132
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:13.868
something that'll destabilize
the quantum field around him.

133
00:07:13.868 --> 00:07:16.305
I'm going to go talk
to the black hole.

134
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.265
So do you guys
finally believe me.

135
00:07:20.265 --> 00:07:23.355
or do you need me
to pee into a cup?

136
00:07:23.355 --> 00:07:27.534
According to all our tests.
you're telling the truth.

137
00:07:27.534 --> 00:07:29.144
You really are Eddie Thawne.

138
00:07:29.144 --> 00:07:30.928
I know.

139
00:07:30.928 --> 00:07:35.455
So who the hell are you.
and how did you know who I am?

140
00:07:43.201 --> 00:07:48.990
You're Barry's daughter?

141
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.993
But I thought--

142
00:07:51.993 --> 00:07:53.690
I know.

143
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.389
You probably recognize me
from when we first met.

144
00:07:57.389 --> 00:07:59.783
2013. New Year's Eve.

145
00:07:59.783 --> 00:08:02.612
I was one
of the new interns at CCPD.

146
00:08:02.612 --> 00:08:04.048
I remember that.

147
00:08:04.048 --> 00:08:06.790
Yeah. we had
to travel back to 2013

148
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.401
to save the timeline.

149
00:08:09.401 --> 00:08:12.492
I'm sorry. are you OK?

150
00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:17.714
That thing I saw
in the museum...

151
00:08:17.714 --> 00:08:20.369
I also saw one at the cemetery.

152
00:08:20.369 --> 00:08:22.545
It killed Captain Korber.

153
00:08:22.545 --> 00:08:24.591
It was a singularity.

154
00:08:24.591 --> 00:08:26.549
Thank God it didn't
keep growing.

155
00:08:26.549 --> 00:08:31.293
One like that almost
destroyed the whole city on--

156
00:08:31.293 --> 00:08:33.469
on the day you died.

157
00:08:36.167 --> 00:08:41.651
Yesterday. I thought I was
a man named Malcolm Gilmore.

158
00:08:41.651 --> 00:08:44.436
It turns out
that whole life was a lie.

159
00:08:44.436 --> 00:08:47.831
and in reality.
I was a dead man--

160
00:08:47.831 --> 00:08:50.573
some idiot who killed himself

161
00:08:50.573 --> 00:08:53.054
to stop a supervillain
that didn't stay dead.

162
00:08:53.054 --> 00:08:56.231
I know. but if you didn't do
what you did in the Pipeline.

163
00:08:56.231 --> 00:08:57.798
my dad would have
died that day.

164
00:08:57.798 --> 00:08:59.234
Maybe.

165
00:08:59.234 --> 00:09:03.194
Or maybe I could have had
a whole life.

166
00:09:03.194 --> 00:09:05.501
a family.

167
00:09:07.677 --> 00:09:10.245
Don't get me wrong.
I'm grateful to be

168
00:09:10.245 --> 00:09:13.335
back from the dead.
but there's being alive.

169
00:09:13.335 --> 00:09:16.033
and there's what makes
life worth living.

170
00:09:16.033 --> 00:09:21.343
And Iris. your mom--

171
00:09:21.343 --> 00:09:23.432
that was my reason.

172
00:09:23.432 --> 00:09:27.131
And without that. I just--

173
00:09:27.131 --> 00:09:29.656
I don't know why I'm here.

174
00:09:29.656 --> 00:09:33.311
I can't imagine how
you must be feeling.

175
00:09:33.311 --> 00:09:35.226
But I know better than most.

176
00:09:35.226 --> 00:09:38.273
you have been given
the rarest gift.

177
00:09:38.273 --> 00:09:40.405
a second chance.

178
00:09:40.405 --> 00:09:43.626
You just have to decide
how you're going to use it.

179
00:09:46.194 --> 00:09:47.717
<i>Well. that does it.</i>

180
00:09:47.717 --> 00:09:51.765
We are officially
out of ways and ideas

181
00:09:51.765 --> 00:09:54.942
to help Barry in 2049
while we are stuck here.

182
00:09:54.942 --> 00:09:56.987
Mark. you were
possessed by the crystal.

183
00:09:56.987 --> 00:09:58.728
Did that offer any insight?

184
00:09:58.728 --> 00:10:02.950
Just that it's powerful
as hell. and it hates Barry.

185
00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:07.389
When I was trapped inside.
all I could think about was--

186
00:10:07.389 --> 00:10:09.217
was how much I love that guy.

187
00:10:09.217 --> 00:10:13.134
He's given me so many second
chances. tenth chances.

188
00:10:13.134 --> 00:10:14.570
I didn't deserve any of them.

189
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.268
I guess my. uh.
love wasn't enough

190
00:10:17.268 --> 00:10:18.400
to fight the crystal's hate.

191
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.445
Mark. I just--

192
00:10:20.445 --> 00:10:21.838
I wish I would have known.

193
00:10:21.838 --> 00:10:23.579
You know. I could
have used my powers

194
00:10:23.579 --> 00:10:25.886
to help boost your empathy
and maybe fight it off.

195
00:10:28.584 --> 00:10:31.108
Maybe you still can.

196
00:10:31.108 --> 00:10:33.241
I mean. when Barry
went to the past.

197
00:10:33.241 --> 00:10:35.330
you could still sense him.

198
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.375
So your powers
work across time.

199
00:10:37.375 --> 00:10:38.942
So what?
What good does that do?

200
00:10:38.942 --> 00:10:40.596
Just because I can feel
something in the future.

201
00:10:40.596 --> 00:10:42.467
it doesn't mean
I can change it.

202
00:10:42.467 --> 00:10:44.469
Not from here.
Not from here.

203
00:10:44.469 --> 00:10:45.993
But you've projected
your consciousness

204
00:10:45.993 --> 00:10:47.864
into other minds before.

205
00:10:47.864 --> 00:10:49.953
But what if you projected
your consciousness.

206
00:10:49.953 --> 00:10:53.653
your present consciousness.
into your future body?

207
00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.916
I could help Barry
fight his next battle.

208
00:10:55.916 --> 00:10:58.048
You could save his life.

209
00:10:58.048 --> 00:10:59.746
Cecile.
are your powers really

210
00:10:59.746 --> 00:11:01.661
strong enough to do that?

211
00:11:03.793 --> 00:11:05.621
Only one way to find out.

212
00:11:05.621 --> 00:11:08.232
Dad. we've got
a code scarlet.

213
00:11:08.232 --> 00:11:11.235
I can't talk about it until
we're on a secure channel.

214
00:11:11.235 --> 00:11:13.281
Something big is up.

215
00:11:13.281 --> 00:11:15.457
An old friend
of yours has stopped by.

216
00:11:15.457 --> 00:11:17.024
I'm on my way
to Mom's right now.

217
00:11:17.024 --> 00:11:18.939
but you better get here
as fast as you can.

218
00:11:18.939 --> 00:11:20.897
<i>Message should reach
the Watchtower</i>

219
00:11:20.897 --> 00:11:22.812
<i>as soon as it emerges from
the dark side of the moon</i>

220
00:11:22.812 --> 00:11:24.945
<i>in 12 hours. 52 minutes.</i>

221
00:11:24.945 --> 00:11:26.294
<i>Good luck. Nora.</i>

222
00:11:29.906 --> 00:11:31.778
<i>Nora.</i>

223
00:11:33.344 --> 00:11:36.130
<i>Nora.</i>

224
00:11:56.541 --> 00:11:59.414
She's a pretty amazing person
to try to forget. huh?

225
00:12:01.677 --> 00:12:04.375
That was a long time ago.

226
00:12:04.375 --> 00:12:06.116
For her.

227
00:12:06.116 --> 00:12:09.032
For you. it was yesterday.

228
00:12:09.032 --> 00:12:11.556
My mom told me a story
about you guys--

229
00:12:11.556 --> 00:12:13.428
that even though
she was destined

230
00:12:13.428 --> 00:12:17.780
to be Iris West-Allen. you
decided to be together anyway.

231
00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.869
Screw the future.

232
00:12:19.869 --> 00:12:21.523
Oh. I'm sorry.

233
00:12:21.523 --> 00:12:23.177
I didn't mean to upset you.

234
00:12:23.177 --> 00:12:25.353
I wouldn't want
another singularity

235
00:12:25.353 --> 00:12:27.442
to open up in the Cortex.

236
00:12:27.442 --> 00:12:29.139
What do you mean?

237
00:12:29.139 --> 00:12:30.837
Those singularities
that have been appearing.

238
00:12:30.837 --> 00:12:32.621
they're tied to your emotions.

239
00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:33.796
Did nobody tell you?

240
00:12:33.796 --> 00:12:35.537
Wait.

241
00:12:35.537 --> 00:12:38.018
So what happened
to Captain Korber.

242
00:12:38.018 --> 00:12:39.367
that's my fault?

243
00:12:39.367 --> 00:12:41.456
You didn't mean
to do it. did you?

244
00:12:41.456 --> 00:12:45.852
Oh. my God. I got her killed.

245
00:12:45.852 --> 00:12:47.854
Nora. you've got to help me.

246
00:12:47.854 --> 00:12:52.249
There must be some way
to fix this. right?

247
00:12:52.249 --> 00:12:53.773
A way to undo this?

248
00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:55.687
I'm not sure.

249
00:12:55.687 --> 00:12:57.907
You thought you were
Malcolm Gilmore. right?

250
00:12:57.907 --> 00:13:00.780
When did you first realize
something was wrong?

251
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.216
I was at Mercury Labs.

252
00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:03.739
Then we should start there.

253
00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:08.788
OK.

254
00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:10.790
Neural activity's stable.

255
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.618
Empathic telemetry
is looking good.

256
00:13:13.618 --> 00:13:15.795
You sure this is going to work?

257
00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.535
Don't worry. Cecile.
You can do this.

258
00:13:17.535 --> 00:13:19.842
Right.
and if by this you mean.

259
00:13:19.842 --> 00:13:24.281
just go on and astrally project
myself into my future body.

260
00:13:24.281 --> 00:13:26.675
protect Barry
from the Negative Speed Force.

261
00:13:26.675 --> 00:13:29.417
and save all
of temporal existence.

262
00:13:29.417 --> 00:13:31.027
before coming back
and teaching Jenna

263
00:13:31.027 --> 00:13:32.724
her multiplication tables.
yeah. you're right.

264
00:13:32.724 --> 00:13:35.771
That's easy. Easy peasy.

265
00:13:35.771 --> 00:13:39.644
Remember. you're there
not to find 2049 Barry.

266
00:13:39.644 --> 00:13:41.516
You're there
to protect our Barry.

267
00:13:41.516 --> 00:13:42.647
OK.

268
00:13:42.647 --> 00:13:44.127
And any friend in the future

269
00:13:44.127 --> 00:13:46.260
could be influenced
by the crystal.

270
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.175
so be careful who you trust.

271
00:13:48.175 --> 00:13:50.264
Gotcha.

272
00:13:53.876 --> 00:13:56.009
OK.

273
00:14:07.324 --> 00:14:10.588
Wait.

274
00:14:10.588 --> 00:14:12.721
It worked.

275
00:14:12.721 --> 00:14:15.463
It worked!

276
00:14:15.463 --> 00:14:17.378
Chester!

277
00:14:17.378 --> 00:14:21.034
Oh. my gosh. this is crazy.

278
00:14:21.034 --> 00:14:25.516
Damn!
Looking good. future me.

279
00:14:25.516 --> 00:14:27.344
What?
- You OK. Cecile?

280
00:14:27.344 --> 00:14:29.781
What? Huh?

281
00:14:29.781 --> 00:14:32.088
Allegra?

282
00:14:35.613 --> 00:14:38.007
Hi.
- Hi.

283
00:14:38.007 --> 00:14:41.184
So have you guys
seen Barry lately?

284
00:14:41.184 --> 00:14:45.188
You mean since
he's been in outer space?

285
00:14:45.188 --> 00:14:47.451
Um. no.

286
00:14:47.451 --> 00:14:49.323
Outer space. OK.

287
00:14:49.323 --> 00:14:50.977
You know what I'm gonna do is.
I'm just gonna--

288
00:14:50.977 --> 00:14:52.761
I'm gonna go ahead.
I'ma hop on comms. anyway.

289
00:14:52.761 --> 00:14:54.632
Why?

290
00:14:54.632 --> 00:14:56.460
No reason.

291
00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.376
Just. you know. call Joe.
Jenna. see what's for dinner.

292
00:14:59.376 --> 00:15:01.378
Oh. I'm sure
Joe would love that.

293
00:15:01.378 --> 00:15:03.424
especially because you haven't
been up to the country house

294
00:15:03.424 --> 00:15:05.121
in a while. right?

295
00:15:06.644 --> 00:15:08.472
Right.

296
00:15:09.821 --> 00:15:12.433
Hey. guys.
You know what's funny?

297
00:15:12.433 --> 00:15:17.917
Weirdly. I can't remember
the last time I was there.

298
00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:20.180
Well. I don't blame you.
considering you're

299
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.877
only there what. twice a year?

300
00:15:21.877 --> 00:15:23.966
Yeah. about that.

301
00:15:23.966 --> 00:15:25.925
I mean.
between the Chronarch Wars

302
00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.578
and helping the Savothian
freedom fighters.

303
00:15:27.578 --> 00:15:30.016
it's been a crazy year.

304
00:15:30.016 --> 00:15:32.105
But I'm sure the fam
understands that we need

305
00:15:32.105 --> 00:15:33.584
a heavy hitter like you.

306
00:15:33.584 --> 00:15:36.283
Yeah.

307
00:15:36.283 --> 00:15:38.589
I'm sure the fam understands.

308
00:15:40.896 --> 00:15:43.116
Are you OK. Cecile?

309
00:15:43.116 --> 00:15:46.989
Cecile. what happened?

310
00:15:46.989 --> 00:15:49.774
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

311
00:15:49.774 --> 00:15:51.341
Wait. what?
What happened?

312
00:15:51.341 --> 00:15:53.169
- Did you see Barry?
- I said I'm sorry. OK?

313
00:15:53.169 --> 00:15:55.041
I can't do it.

314
00:15:55.041 --> 00:15:57.173
We're going to have
to find another way.

315
00:15:59.784 --> 00:16:02.570
OK. somebody's going
after her. right?

316
00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:07.227
Oh. goddess lady. looks
like you're up.

317
00:16:07.227 --> 00:16:12.406
Actually. I'm not the best
person for this one. Chester.

318
00:16:12.406 --> 00:16:14.016
You are.

319
00:16:14.016 --> 00:16:15.931
Oh. no. I--

320
00:16:15.931 --> 00:16:18.107
I don't know. guys.
- Don't be afraid.

321
00:16:18.107 --> 00:16:20.588
Your heart is stronger
than your fear.

322
00:16:20.588 --> 00:16:23.069
and it'll know what
to say to Cecile.

323
00:16:28.117 --> 00:16:30.598
You see anything unusual?

324
00:16:30.598 --> 00:16:32.730
Nope. but you're
the detective.

325
00:16:34.341 --> 00:16:37.431
Why do you think you're here?

326
00:16:37.431 --> 00:16:41.739
Do you think
you just randomly popped up

327
00:16:41.739 --> 00:16:45.395
decades after you died
by coincidence?

328
00:16:45.395 --> 00:16:46.875
No.

329
00:16:46.875 --> 00:16:50.661
There's no such thing
as a coincidence.

330
00:16:50.661 --> 00:16:54.361
Then you must be here
for a purpose.

331
00:16:54.361 --> 00:16:57.320
Maybe it has something to do
with the other Thawnes.

332
00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.671
They were a pretty big deal.

333
00:17:00.671 --> 00:17:04.284
Or at least they
were supposed to be.

334
00:17:04.284 --> 00:17:08.723
I am from the future.
and you are the only Thawne

335
00:17:08.723 --> 00:17:10.942
to be all but forgotten
by history.

336
00:17:12.335 --> 00:17:14.859
Waste of a life.
waste of a man.

337
00:17:18.428 --> 00:17:20.213
Eobard told me that.

338
00:17:20.213 --> 00:17:23.477
And he was just trying
to get under my skin.

339
00:17:23.477 --> 00:17:26.001
And it worked. didn't it?

340
00:17:26.001 --> 00:17:32.312
You proved him wrong
by throwing your life away.

341
00:17:32.312 --> 00:17:35.793
But what if you had the power
to get that life back?

342
00:17:35.793 --> 00:17:37.491
What do you mean?

343
00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:42.017
The Flash gets his power
from the Speed Force.

344
00:17:42.017 --> 00:17:45.020
but there's another side
to the equation.

345
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:49.981
another power that spent
far too long in the shadows.

346
00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:54.508
forced
into an unnatural balance.

347
00:17:56.379 --> 00:17:59.861
It needs someone
to stand up to the Flash.

348
00:17:59.861 --> 00:18:02.298
And that should be you.

349
00:18:02.298 --> 00:18:04.518
I don't understand.

350
00:18:04.518 --> 00:18:07.999
Are you talking
about hurting your dad?

351
00:18:07.999 --> 00:18:12.352
Eddie. are you
still this pathetic?

352
00:18:13.875 --> 00:18:17.792
Are you a waste of a man.
like Eobard said?

353
00:18:17.792 --> 00:18:24.494
A loser. a nobody.
forgotten by history?

354
00:18:24.494 --> 00:18:27.062
Are you still the idiot
who died trying

355
00:18:27.062 --> 00:18:29.020
to save a man
who stole his life?

356
00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.154
No! I'm not.

357
00:18:32.154 --> 00:18:34.243
Then show me.

358
00:18:34.243 --> 00:18:36.724
You know how things
were supposed to be.

359
00:18:36.724 --> 00:18:40.162
You can have that life
if you take it.

360
00:18:45.689 --> 00:18:47.648
<i>Eddie.</i>

361
00:18:47.648 --> 00:18:50.912
<i>Choose.</i>

362
00:18:50.912 --> 00:18:54.002
No. this can't be real.

363
00:18:54.002 --> 00:18:56.918
I need some air.

364
00:18:58.441 --> 00:19:00.487
You were right.

365
00:19:00.487 --> 00:19:02.141
He is what we need.

366
00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:05.448
He is what
we've been looking for.

367
00:19:05.448 --> 00:19:09.800
And soon he'll be all ours.

368
00:19:13.587 --> 00:19:15.415
Nora?

369
00:19:15.415 --> 00:19:17.330
Dad.

370
00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.027
What are you doing here?

371
00:19:19.027 --> 00:19:21.769
We're under attack
by the Negative Speed Force.

372
00:19:21.769 --> 00:19:25.729
It's throwing me across time.
using our friends to hurt us.

373
00:19:25.729 --> 00:19:29.080
I'm just glad to see you.

374
00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.387
Me too.

375
00:19:32.823 --> 00:19:34.260
Agh!

376
00:19:45.445 --> 00:19:47.751
No.

377
00:19:47.751 --> 00:19:50.276
Nora. this isn't you.

378
00:19:50.276 --> 00:19:52.191
It's the Negative Speed Force.

379
00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:54.236
Oh. Barry.

380
00:19:54.236 --> 00:20:01.635
So fast.
but somehow always so slow.

381
00:20:01.635 --> 00:20:06.161
You never figured out
the most powerful form of hate

382
00:20:06.161 --> 00:20:08.250
is by corrupting love

383
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:12.515
by twisting it
into its negative.

384
00:20:12.515 --> 00:20:15.083
You're not going
to make me hurt her.

385
00:20:15.083 --> 00:20:16.824
Agh!

386
00:20:16.824 --> 00:20:18.826
Either you kill
your daughter.

387
00:20:18.826 --> 00:20:20.610
or I kill you.

388
00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.961
Both ways. I win.

389
00:20:23.961 --> 00:20:26.355
Nora!
What are you doing?

390
00:20:26.355 --> 00:20:27.835
Eddie.

391
00:20:27.835 --> 00:20:29.184
Eddie. I told you.

392
00:20:29.184 --> 00:20:31.012
we're getting your life back.

393
00:20:31.012 --> 00:20:32.927
No. this isn't right.

394
00:20:37.105 --> 00:20:41.457
Eddie. I can't believe
you're really here.

395
00:20:41.457 --> 00:20:44.504
You sacrificed
your life to save me.

396
00:20:44.504 --> 00:20:48.247
I never thanked you.

397
00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:51.467
You too. Bar.

398
00:20:51.467 --> 00:20:53.034
These last couple days.

399
00:20:53.034 --> 00:20:55.079
I feel like I've been
losing my mind.

400
00:20:58.474 --> 00:21:01.477
Do you live here?

401
00:21:01.477 --> 00:21:05.046
I thought
this was my home. my life.

402
00:21:05.046 --> 00:21:09.746
But I was wrong.

403
00:21:11.879 --> 00:21:14.838
Everything's wrong.

404
00:21:16.057 --> 00:21:18.015
Eddie.

405
00:21:20.757 --> 00:21:22.803
It's going to be all right.

406
00:21:22.803 --> 00:21:25.066
I don't know how
I got here. either.

407
00:21:25.066 --> 00:21:27.895
The power in that crystal
is attacking me and my family

408
00:21:27.895 --> 00:21:30.071
through time.

409
00:21:30.071 --> 00:21:33.379
Now it's possessed my daughter.

410
00:21:33.379 --> 00:21:36.295
and I don't know how
to stop it.

411
00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:38.819
Maybe we can together.

412
00:21:44.868 --> 00:21:49.786
All I know is
I used to be Malcolm Gilmore.

413
00:21:49.786 --> 00:21:53.616
I had his life. his memories.

414
00:21:53.616 --> 00:21:57.490
And that was a lie.

415
00:21:59.143 --> 00:22:01.145
How is that possible?

416
00:22:03.409 --> 00:22:05.367
What the hell?

417
00:22:05.367 --> 00:22:07.108
Wait.

418
00:22:07.108 --> 00:22:09.502
I've seen that happen before.

419
00:22:09.502 --> 00:22:12.026
My driver's license.

420
00:22:12.026 --> 00:22:15.682
I've seen reactions
like this too.

421
00:22:15.682 --> 00:22:18.424
caused by negative tachyons.

422
00:22:18.424 --> 00:22:24.343
I think this place. Malcolm's
belongings. his life--

423
00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:27.607
it's all made
of negative tachyons.

424
00:22:27.607 --> 00:22:31.611
Like a false reality
built for you to live in.

425
00:22:31.611 --> 00:22:33.352
Well. who could
have done that?

426
00:22:33.352 --> 00:22:35.092
There's only one force
powerful enough--

427
00:22:35.092 --> 00:22:38.226
the one inside that crystal.

428
00:22:38.226 --> 00:22:42.099
The Negative Speed Force.

429
00:22:42.099 --> 00:22:45.538
I think it brought
you back to life.

430
00:22:45.538 --> 00:22:47.540
Why would it bring me back?

431
00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:52.022
Eddie. I think the Negative
Speed Force resurrected you.

432
00:22:52.022 --> 00:22:53.894
so you could be its avatar.

433
00:22:58.942 --> 00:23:02.381
Hey. um...

434
00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:05.558
Mark is recalibrating
the jump configuration.

435
00:23:05.558 --> 00:23:08.865
in case you wanted
to give it another go.

436
00:23:11.433 --> 00:23:13.609
How are you feeling?

437
00:23:13.609 --> 00:23:16.220
- Like a failure.
- Oh. look.

438
00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.918
Don't be so hard on yourself.

439
00:23:17.918 --> 00:23:20.834
I mean. we all make mistakes
on a mission. right?

440
00:23:20.834 --> 00:23:23.619
I didn't make a mistake
on my mission. Chester.

441
00:23:23.619 --> 00:23:26.448
I made a mistake in my life.

442
00:23:26.448 --> 00:23:29.495
You know how Joe
and I just finally

443
00:23:29.495 --> 00:23:31.801
found a balance
between my duties here

444
00:23:31.801 --> 00:23:33.499
and my time with my family?

445
00:23:33.499 --> 00:23:34.848
So I go home on the weekends.

446
00:23:34.848 --> 00:23:36.327
I spend time
with him and Jenna.

447
00:23:36.327 --> 00:23:40.723
Well. in the future.
you guys told me

448
00:23:40.723 --> 00:23:45.032
that I have only
been home twice in a year.

449
00:23:45.032 --> 00:23:47.904
Oh. I see.

450
00:23:47.904 --> 00:23:50.211
Well. maybe you
have a good reason.

451
00:23:50.211 --> 00:23:51.647
You know. maybe in the future.

452
00:23:51.647 --> 00:23:53.519
you guys hang out in.
like. a VR portal

453
00:23:53.519 --> 00:23:55.129
to make up
for missing face time.

454
00:23:55.129 --> 00:23:57.740
No. no. Chester. no.
I know myself.

455
00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:02.136
God. I've made
this mistake before.

456
00:24:02.136 --> 00:24:04.878
Like how I wasn't there
for my own mother's death

457
00:24:04.878 --> 00:24:07.750
because I was too busy working.
and now I just--

458
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:10.579
I have this awful feeling that
I'm making the same mistake

459
00:24:10.579 --> 00:24:12.929
again in the future.

460
00:24:12.929 --> 00:24:16.759
Chester. I'm scared
that this choice that I made

461
00:24:16.759 --> 00:24:19.414
to live this superhero life.

462
00:24:19.414 --> 00:24:22.635
it means that I'm
going to lose my family.

463
00:24:22.635 --> 00:24:25.159
I don't believe you.

464
00:24:25.159 --> 00:24:27.901
Look. I get what you're saying.

465
00:24:27.901 --> 00:24:31.861
But listen.
if past me could see me now.

466
00:24:31.861 --> 00:24:34.734
here in S.T.A.R. Labs
working with Team Flash.

467
00:24:34.734 --> 00:24:36.605
he'd freak out.

468
00:24:36.605 --> 00:24:39.565
So right now
you're making it work.

469
00:24:39.565 --> 00:24:42.785
balancing being
a fricking superhero

470
00:24:42.785 --> 00:24:44.744
and being with your family.

471
00:24:44.744 --> 00:24:46.702
So why not trust
that you can do the same thing

472
00:24:46.702 --> 00:24:48.225
30 years from now too?

473
00:24:48.225 --> 00:24:50.967
Twice in a year.
That's what you said.

474
00:24:50.967 --> 00:24:54.536
I don't care how long you and
Joe have been apart. Cecile.

475
00:24:54.536 --> 00:24:56.538
Or why.

476
00:24:57.974 --> 00:24:59.672
Look.

477
00:24:59.672 --> 00:25:03.719
Because I know
you guys love each other.

478
00:25:03.719 --> 00:25:06.461
Now you just need to embrace
what's around the corner

479
00:25:06.461 --> 00:25:08.550
and trust that this legacy
that you're building

480
00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.640
for yourself is the right one

481
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.034
because I. for one. do.

482
00:25:14.034 --> 00:25:16.166
How can you be so sure?

483
00:25:16.166 --> 00:25:18.908
Because
your greatest strength

484
00:25:18.908 --> 00:25:23.347
isn't some meta ability.

485
00:25:23.347 --> 00:25:28.091
Cecile. it's your heart.
and your dedication

486
00:25:28.091 --> 00:25:31.312
to the people that you love.

487
00:25:31.312 --> 00:25:33.227
That's a real virtue.

488
00:25:37.405 --> 00:25:41.322
Its avatar?
Avatar for what?

489
00:25:41.322 --> 00:25:44.064
A Negative Speed Force.
it needs a surrogate on Earth

490
00:25:44.064 --> 00:25:46.370
to carry out its plan.

491
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:48.111
That's what the crystal
has been doing all along.

492
00:25:48.111 --> 00:25:49.722
Joe. Mark. Nora.

493
00:25:49.722 --> 00:25:51.506
I mean. it can only
possess them temporarily.

494
00:25:51.506 --> 00:25:54.117
It must need you
to choose to take on its power.

495
00:25:54.117 --> 00:25:56.076
No.

496
00:25:56.076 --> 00:25:58.121
That can't be right.

497
00:25:58.121 --> 00:26:00.602
The crystal showed me
a better life.

498
00:26:00.602 --> 00:26:04.519
one with a daughter
I was supposed to have.

499
00:26:04.519 --> 00:26:06.390
Eddie. the Negative
Speed Force is unlike

500
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:07.740
anything
you've ever seen before.

501
00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.219
It gets inside your head.

502
00:26:09.219 --> 00:26:12.483
It feeds off hate and rage.
all right?

503
00:26:12.483 --> 00:26:14.311
Everything about it is evil.

504
00:26:14.311 --> 00:26:17.663
It brought me back
from the dead. OK?

505
00:26:17.663 --> 00:26:20.622
Is that evil?

506
00:26:20.622 --> 00:26:26.323
And what if I choose not
to be the avatar. huh?

507
00:26:26.323 --> 00:26:28.761
Do I go back to being dead?

508
00:26:28.761 --> 00:26:31.111
No. no. we'll find
a way to save you.

509
00:26:31.111 --> 00:26:33.156
You could choose
to start a new life.

510
00:26:33.156 --> 00:26:35.028
<i>He lies.</i>

511
00:26:35.028 --> 00:26:36.769
Oh. really?

512
00:26:36.769 --> 00:26:38.945
Because all your team tried
to do today was cuff me.

513
00:26:38.945 --> 00:26:42.426
But that crystal.
it actually wants

514
00:26:42.426 --> 00:26:45.429
to help me get my life back.

515
00:26:45.429 --> 00:26:49.216
A life I was a fool to give up.

516
00:26:49.216 --> 00:26:51.566
<i>There's still time.</i>

517
00:26:51.566 --> 00:26:52.915
Come on.
You don't believe that.

518
00:26:52.915 --> 00:26:55.352
Don't tell me what I believe!

519
00:26:56.702 --> 00:27:02.446
Did you know I can
hear it right now?

520
00:27:02.446 --> 00:27:08.061
Sometimes I can't tell
if it's the crystal's voice

521
00:27:08.061 --> 00:27:11.238
or my own voice.

522
00:27:11.238 --> 00:27:13.544
And I'm starting to wonder.
what's the difference?

523
00:27:13.544 --> 00:27:17.374
It's funny.

524
00:27:17.374 --> 00:27:21.117
Returning from the dead
really has a way

525
00:27:21.117 --> 00:27:23.903
of making you
realize the mistakes

526
00:27:23.903 --> 00:27:26.209
you made in your old life.

527
00:27:26.209 --> 00:27:29.517
My mistake was being a nobody.

528
00:27:29.517 --> 00:27:31.824
Eddie. you weren't
a nobody. all right?

529
00:27:31.824 --> 00:27:33.434
Listen to me--
- No!

530
00:27:33.434 --> 00:27:35.088
You listen.

531
00:27:35.088 --> 00:27:38.918
The second I died.
everyone forgot about me.

532
00:27:38.918 --> 00:27:44.706
And you. Barry. the man
I sacrificed my life for.

533
00:27:44.706 --> 00:27:48.667
you thanked me
by stealing my fiancée.

534
00:27:48.667 --> 00:27:50.146
Eddie.

535
00:27:50.146 --> 00:27:55.064
But now I have
a chance to change that.

536
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:03.594
If I choose the crystal.

537
00:28:03.594 --> 00:28:07.076
maybe I could be the hero.

538
00:28:08.817 --> 00:28:14.301
I could get the girl
and the family I deserve.

539
00:28:14.301 --> 00:28:16.520
Eddie.

540
00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.698
I know how much you're hurting.

541
00:28:19.698 --> 00:28:23.571
The life you're talking about.
it's not yours.

542
00:28:23.571 --> 00:28:26.443
Iris isn't your wife.

543
00:28:26.443 --> 00:28:28.097
Nora is not your daughter.

544
00:28:28.097 --> 00:28:29.925
But there were
supposed to be!

545
00:28:29.925 --> 00:28:31.274
And they still can be!

546
00:28:31.274 --> 00:28:33.581
Eddie. you know
that's not right.

547
00:28:33.581 --> 00:28:36.627
You have a chance
to start over.

548
00:28:36.627 --> 00:28:39.065
to have your own life.

549
00:28:43.243 --> 00:28:45.985
What would Iris want you to do?

550
00:28:53.906 --> 00:28:56.386
Flash!

551
00:28:56.386 --> 00:28:58.737
Bring me the avatar!

552
00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:00.826
Bring me Eddie Thawne.

553
00:29:00.826 --> 00:29:03.654
or I will
tear this city apart!

554
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.876
Eddie. I have to go.

555
00:29:07.876 --> 00:29:10.531
But I believe in you.

556
00:29:10.531 --> 00:29:13.839
I know no matter what happens.

557
00:29:13.839 --> 00:29:16.102
you'll make the right choice.

558
00:29:31.334 --> 00:29:33.075
Flash. do you hear me?

559
00:29:33.075 --> 00:29:35.425
Bring me Eddie!

560
00:29:35.425 --> 00:29:39.560
Where is the chosen one?

561
00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.476
He's making his own choice.

562
00:29:42.476 --> 00:29:43.999
Seems like that isn't you.

563
00:29:43.999 --> 00:29:46.610
We'll see about that!

564
00:29:58.753 --> 00:30:00.973
Let's get to work.

565
00:30:00.973 --> 00:30:03.540
OK.

566
00:30:57.072 --> 00:30:59.292
Nora.

567
00:30:59.292 --> 00:31:01.033
Nora. please.

568
00:31:01.033 --> 00:31:02.773
I know you're still in there.

569
00:31:02.773 --> 00:31:05.211
I need your help
to fight this thing.

570
00:31:07.256 --> 00:31:09.128
Sorry. Dad.

571
00:31:09.128 --> 00:31:13.132
The little girl
you loved is long gone.

572
00:31:16.135 --> 00:31:18.659
Ahh!

573
00:31:33.761 --> 00:31:35.763
Iris.

574
00:31:36.764 --> 00:31:39.419
Oh. my beautiful Iris.

575
00:31:39.419 --> 00:31:41.029
Sorry.

576
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:42.857
I knocked.
but you didn't answer.

577
00:31:42.857 --> 00:31:46.774
and I know you always leave
the key by the door.

578
00:31:46.774 --> 00:31:49.081
Oh. my God. Eddie?

579
00:31:49.081 --> 00:31:51.692
I can't imagine what
you must be thinking.

580
00:31:51.692 --> 00:31:54.434
And if you want me
to leave. I'll go.

581
00:31:54.434 --> 00:31:58.307
But it's me. your Eddie.

582
00:31:58.307 --> 00:32:00.092
Look into my eyes.

583
00:32:00.092 --> 00:32:03.747
I know that you know me
better than anyone.

584
00:32:03.747 --> 00:32:05.793
Who do you see?

585
00:32:06.881 --> 00:32:09.362
Oh. my God. it is you.

586
00:32:14.976 --> 00:32:16.847
How is this possible?

587
00:32:16.847 --> 00:32:19.328
It's complicated.

588
00:32:19.328 --> 00:32:25.160
But I'm done trying
to solve this mystery.

589
00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:29.469
I came here because I
have a decision to make.

590
00:32:29.469 --> 00:32:34.865
and I knew I couldn't make it
without seeing you.

591
00:32:34.865 --> 00:32:37.390
Even if it was
for the last time.

592
00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:39.914
What?
You just got here.

593
00:32:39.914 --> 00:32:42.830
Why don't you stay?
We can help you.

594
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:46.399
Trust me. I don't want to go.

595
00:32:46.399 --> 00:32:48.967
I just want to do
the right thing.

596
00:32:50.316 --> 00:32:53.362
But sometimes it's hard
to know what that is.

597
00:32:53.362 --> 00:32:56.539
especially with that voice
in my head pulling me

598
00:32:56.539 --> 00:32:58.889
in different directions.

599
00:33:07.681 --> 00:33:12.468
Actually. on second thought.
I think I should stay.

600
00:33:20.737 --> 00:33:23.392
Do you
know why I'm about to win?

601
00:33:23.392 --> 00:33:26.917
Because you don't have the guts
to kill your own flesh

602
00:33:26.917 --> 00:33:30.269
and blood. unlike Eddie.

603
00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:32.749
That's why he's
the ultimate avatar.

604
00:33:35.404 --> 00:33:39.452
And you'll die
in the street like an animal.

605
00:33:46.459 --> 00:33:49.331
Hey. blue eyes!

606
00:33:55.511 --> 00:33:56.817
Impressive.

607
00:33:56.817 --> 00:33:58.993
But I know you. empath.

608
00:33:58.993 --> 00:34:00.647
You won't hurt me.

609
00:34:00.647 --> 00:34:02.649
You're right.

610
00:34:02.649 --> 00:34:04.433
I won't hurt Nora.

611
00:34:04.433 --> 00:34:08.002
But for you.
I'm going to bring the pain.

612
00:34:08.002 --> 00:34:10.222
Now get out of her head!

613
00:34:19.883 --> 00:34:21.972
And stay out!

614
00:34:37.814 --> 00:34:39.294
Cecile?

615
00:34:39.294 --> 00:34:42.906
Actually. call me Virtue.

616
00:34:47.911 --> 00:34:51.350
Iris. I know
this is a lot to take in.

617
00:34:53.134 --> 00:34:56.268
My sacrifice robbed us
of our future.

618
00:34:56.268 --> 00:34:59.749
but this is a second chance
to put things right.

619
00:34:59.749 --> 00:35:02.143
Iris West.

620
00:35:03.623 --> 00:35:06.800
All you have to do is say I do.

621
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.238
No. I don't. Eddie.

622
00:35:10.238 --> 00:35:13.067
Eddie. you once said that
there was always three people

623
00:35:13.067 --> 00:35:14.460
in our relationship.

624
00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.679
And you told me
that's not true.

625
00:35:16.679 --> 00:35:19.943
I was wrong.
It was always Barry.

626
00:35:19.943 --> 00:35:22.207
Even back then.
if I didn't realize it myself.

627
00:35:22.207 --> 00:35:23.817
You don't mean that.

628
00:35:23.817 --> 00:35:25.297
Eddie. I'm not sure
how you got here.

629
00:35:25.297 --> 00:35:26.646
but something is wrong.

630
00:35:26.646 --> 00:35:28.735
And if you let us.
we will help you.

631
00:35:28.735 --> 00:35:31.868
But I love Barry.
I love my family.

632
00:35:31.868 --> 00:35:33.783
and I love the life
that we've built together.

633
00:35:33.783 --> 00:35:35.742
now more than ever.

634
00:35:35.742 --> 00:35:37.613
This is my future.

635
00:35:37.613 --> 00:35:40.181
And I'm sorry.
that's not with you.

636
00:35:40.181 --> 00:35:42.183
You're going to regret that.

637
00:35:45.099 --> 00:35:48.885
You. Barry.

638
00:35:48.885 --> 00:35:52.715
and everything you both love.

639
00:35:58.243 --> 00:36:00.027
Dad. I'm so sorry.

640
00:36:00.027 --> 00:36:02.421
It's OK. Nora.

641
00:36:02.421 --> 00:36:04.423
It's OK.

642
00:36:05.946 --> 00:36:08.253
Oh. my God.

643
00:36:11.256 --> 00:36:13.736
Eddie.

644
00:36:15.564 --> 00:36:17.610
What did you do?

645
00:36:25.183 --> 00:36:26.880
So you're
the Barry from 2023.

646
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.838
And you are
the Cecile from 2023.

647
00:36:28.838 --> 00:36:30.579
but in our Cecile's body.

648
00:36:30.579 --> 00:36:32.929
And here I thought today
couldn't get any freakier.

649
00:36:32.929 --> 00:36:35.236
Look. the crystal
that possessed Nora.

650
00:36:35.236 --> 00:36:36.672
it attacked me in the past.

651
00:36:36.672 --> 00:36:38.848
And then it went
after the team in 2023.

652
00:36:38.848 --> 00:36:41.024
Wait. why don't we
remember these attacks?

653
00:36:41.024 --> 00:36:42.722
Because they're
happening simultaneously

654
00:36:42.722 --> 00:36:44.506
across the timeline.

655
00:36:44.506 --> 00:36:46.204
First in the past--

656
00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:49.598
- Then in your present.
- And now here. in 2049.

657
00:36:49.598 --> 00:36:52.906
All while charging the crystal
for the new avatar. Eddie.

658
00:36:52.906 --> 00:36:54.603
That's not all.

659
00:36:54.603 --> 00:36:56.475
Speed Force Nora
showed up in 2023.

660
00:36:56.475 --> 00:36:58.085
She said
that she was under attack

661
00:36:58.085 --> 00:37:00.130
and that all that remains
of the Speed Force

662
00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:01.610
lives in your family.

663
00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:03.003
And then she vanished.

664
00:37:03.003 --> 00:37:05.005
Big Nora's gone?

665
00:37:06.441 --> 00:37:07.747
Dad--

666
00:37:07.747 --> 00:37:09.270
I know.

667
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:11.054
Explains why we can't
feel her anymore.

668
00:37:11.054 --> 00:37:13.709
Sweet NK Jemisin.

669
00:37:13.709 --> 00:37:16.190
OK. all this red energy
that's appearing in the sky.

670
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:17.844
it's not lightning.

671
00:37:17.844 --> 00:37:21.239
It's the timeline
starting to fracture.

672
00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:23.415
And it'll spread
in every direction--

673
00:37:23.415 --> 00:37:26.635
Until there's nothing left
of the timeline at all.

674
00:37:26.635 --> 00:37:28.507
How long do we have. Chuck?

675
00:37:28.507 --> 00:37:31.901
I'm not sure. but at
this rate of degradation.

676
00:37:31.901 --> 00:37:34.121
not very long.

677
00:37:34.121 --> 00:37:36.254
Cecile.
I still can't time travel.

678
00:37:36.254 --> 00:37:38.430
Can you warn
the team back in 2023?

679
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:40.345
Yeah. on it.

680
00:37:40.345 --> 00:37:43.130
But what do I tell
the team about Eddie?

681
00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:45.872
Is there a chance he rejected
that crystal's offer?

682
00:37:45.872 --> 00:37:48.701
Barry.

683
00:37:48.701 --> 00:37:50.703
We need to talk.

684
00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:00.103
You're as beautiful
as the day we got married.

685
00:38:00.103 --> 00:38:03.933
I haven't seen you
like this in so long.

686
00:38:03.933 --> 00:38:05.631
It's weird.

687
00:38:05.631 --> 00:38:09.243
There's so much I want
to ask you about our lives.

688
00:38:09.243 --> 00:38:11.158
if we're happy.

689
00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:16.119
I wish we had more time.

690
00:38:16.119 --> 00:38:20.080
I can't believe
Eddie is doing this.

691
00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.256
He seemed like his old self.

692
00:38:22.256 --> 00:38:24.040
but then he started
going on about how

693
00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.868
fate brought him back here.

694
00:38:25.868 --> 00:38:30.308
It was like he was seeing
things. hearing things.

695
00:38:30.308 --> 00:38:34.224
The Negative Space Force
is still manipulating his mind.

696
00:38:36.792 --> 00:38:40.753
I don't know how
to stop what's coming.

697
00:38:40.753 --> 00:38:44.147
But I swear. Iris.
I will do whatever it takes

698
00:38:44.147 --> 00:38:47.107
to protect you and our family.

699
00:38:47.107 --> 00:38:49.327
I know.

700
00:38:52.199 --> 00:38:57.291
And to answer your question.
yes. we're happy.

701
00:38:58.988 --> 00:39:01.904
Every day. I love you more than
I even thought was possible.

702
00:39:01.904 --> 00:39:05.038
And no matter what
challenges life puts on us.

703
00:39:05.038 --> 00:39:08.389
we face them together.

704
00:39:08.389 --> 00:39:10.086
Always.

705
00:39:10.086 --> 00:39:12.654
I can't wait.

706
00:39:14.439 --> 00:39:15.701
