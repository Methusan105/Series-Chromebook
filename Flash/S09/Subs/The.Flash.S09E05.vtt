<i>Previously.
on "The Flash"...</i>

2
00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.831
You're gonna get pregnant
in three months.

3
00:00:08.051 --> 00:00:09.574
<i>I think we should leave
Central City.</i>

4
00:00:09.574 --> 00:00:10.880
<i>You can call me Khione.</i>

5
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.100
I hope you can accept me.

6
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.318
You know.
if it wasn't for you.

7
00:00:14.318 --> 00:00:15.798
<i>I could've got a prospect.</i>

8
00:00:15.798 --> 00:00:17.104
<i>We still haven't
talked about</i>

9
00:00:17.104 --> 00:00:18.105
<i>our other close encounter.</i>

10
00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:19.410
Um. uh. later.

11
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.977
<i>Central City.</i>

12
00:00:20.977 --> 00:00:24.328
<i>now all of you
will pay the price.</i>

13
00:00:24.328 --> 00:00:25.895
How long until it's finished?

14
00:00:25.895 --> 00:00:27.679
Or is getting
your girlfriend back

15
00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.638
not important anymore?
<i>- How about we put together</i>

16
00:00:29.638 --> 00:00:30.769
<i>a little team of Rogues
of our own?</i>

17
00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:31.944
You're gonna run

18
00:00:31.944 --> 00:00:33.250
until you can't run anymore.

19
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.947
<i>I overloaded the capacitors.</i>

20
00:00:34.947 --> 00:00:36.645
<i>The treadmill shot it
all back at her.</i>

21
00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:38.038
<i>The treadmill drained
too much of my speed.</i>

22
00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:40.953
<i>I can't run.</i>
- I'll hold 'em off.

23
00:00:42.607 --> 00:00:43.913
Somebody order
a prison break?

24
00:00:43.913 --> 00:00:45.306
We gotta get Mark.

25
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.569
Stop!

26
00:00:50.354 --> 00:00:52.269
Ah! Mark.

27
00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.849
It's getting worse out there. Captain.

28
00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:08.546
- More red lightning strikes?
- And they've started

29
00:01:08.546 --> 00:01:10.070
three more fires--
at the shipyard.

30
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.854
Central City High School
and City Hall.

31
00:01:11.854 --> 00:01:13.160
What about first responders?

32
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.726
They're doing their best.

33
00:01:14.726 --> 00:01:16.250
and we're trying to help them.
but Captain.

34
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.903
with all these emergencies
and the looting.

35
00:01:17.903 --> 00:01:19.340
we don't have enough units
to keep up.

36
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.515
We need help.

37
00:01:20.515 --> 00:01:22.865
I know where to find it.

38
00:01:25.737 --> 00:01:27.391
Officer. can I help you?

39
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.602
Take the hardware
to the roof.

40
00:02:04.602 --> 00:02:06.517
Let me know
the moment you're ready.

41
00:02:24.187 --> 00:02:26.189
A mimic.

42
00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.582
How cute.

43
00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.026
Leave her to me.

44
00:02:37.026 --> 00:02:38.854
You two cover the exits.

45
00:02:38.854 --> 00:02:41.726
Make sure we don't have
any more unpleasant surprises.

46
00:02:41.726 --> 00:02:45.208
And remember.
no one gets in or out.

47
00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:47.428
Fine.

48
00:02:47.428 --> 00:02:49.995
Nobody gets in or out...

49
00:02:49.995 --> 00:02:53.521
alive.
- Now you're playing my tune.

50
00:02:54.565 --> 00:02:57.264
That took guts.

51
00:02:57.264 --> 00:03:00.223
You know.
I think you're the kind of cop

52
00:03:00.223 --> 00:03:03.095
who will appreciate
what I'm about to do.

53
00:03:03.095 --> 00:03:05.228
Whatever you're planning.

54
00:03:05.228 --> 00:03:06.838
you won't get away with it.

55
00:03:06.838 --> 00:03:08.275
Yes. I will.

56
00:03:10.146 --> 00:03:12.104
Don't worry.

57
00:03:12.104 --> 00:03:17.240
I will show you
what true justice looks like.

58
00:03:37.608 --> 00:03:40.089
We never leave anyone behind.

59
00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:41.438
We do
when it saves our asses.

60
00:03:41.438 --> 00:03:42.787
He's right.
It was us or Mark.

61
00:03:42.787 --> 00:03:43.919
We had no choice.

62
00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.399
You always have a choice.

63
00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:46.791
Are you paying attention.
Lite-Brite?

64
00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:48.140
We got evil speedsters.

65
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.794
Chill-lame backstabbed us.

66
00:03:49.794 --> 00:03:52.057
the city's on fire
with crazy red lightning.

67
00:03:52.057 --> 00:03:54.756
and your boy here
barely has any speed.

68
00:03:54.756 --> 00:03:55.974
This ain't it.

69
00:03:55.974 --> 00:03:57.672
Oh. damn.

70
00:03:57.672 --> 00:04:00.414
The Red Death's coming
after us next. isn't she?

71
00:04:00.414 --> 00:04:01.850
We destroyed
the cosmic treadmill.

72
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:02.981
her only ticket out of town.

73
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:04.461
Yeah. we're screwed.

74
00:04:04.461 --> 00:04:05.549
The whole city is.

75
00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.638
Then we need to save it.

76
00:04:07.638 --> 00:04:09.466
People are in danger.

77
00:04:09.466 --> 00:04:11.642
They need my help.

78
00:04:11.642 --> 00:04:13.035
You can't even help yourself.

79
00:04:13.035 --> 00:04:14.776
This whole situation's
a dumpster fire.

80
00:04:14.776 --> 00:04:16.995
And look. Barry.
if you lost most of your speed

81
00:04:16.995 --> 00:04:18.475
running on
the Red Death's treadmill.

82
00:04:18.475 --> 00:04:19.563
I mean. how are we supposed
to do anything--

83
00:04:19.563 --> 00:04:21.086
I don't know.

84
00:04:21.086 --> 00:04:22.131
That's why we need
to get back out there

85
00:04:22.131 --> 00:04:23.480
and find a way.

86
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.177
Rush into battle
with no plan.

87
00:04:25.177 --> 00:04:27.267
Yeah. that's not gonna
get the rest of us killed.

88
00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:28.833
We need to stay put.

89
00:04:28.833 --> 00:04:30.400
Well. maybe
we don't need to go

90
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.663
back into the field
to make our next move.

91
00:04:32.663 --> 00:04:34.056
I always liked you.

92
00:04:34.056 --> 00:04:36.058
Look. I got to know Ryan

93
00:04:36.058 --> 00:04:37.799
during our little chit-chat
back at the loft.

94
00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:40.018
and if she blames us
for keeping her here.

95
00:04:40.018 --> 00:04:43.195
then she's probably filled
with hatred and rage by now.

96
00:04:44.327 --> 00:04:47.025
Which are feelings
we could trace...

97
00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:49.245
with a little help
from a friend.

98
00:04:50.725 --> 00:04:53.467
Babe. you sure
you wanna do this?

99
00:04:53.467 --> 00:04:56.034
Babe. everyone on this team
has a purpose.

100
00:04:56.034 --> 00:04:57.384
This is mine.

101
00:04:59.473 --> 00:05:01.257
Okay. so how is this
supposed to work?

102
00:05:01.257 --> 00:05:03.912
Well. by boosting
Cecile's empathic telemetry

103
00:05:03.912 --> 00:05:05.740
and superimposing it
over the city grid.

104
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.439
I can pretty much hone in
on whatever she senses.

105
00:05:11.049 --> 00:05:13.182
Remember.
you're looking for hate.

106
00:05:13.182 --> 00:05:15.576
Lots of it.

107
00:05:15.576 --> 00:05:19.580
Okay.
triangulation grid is...

108
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.538
ready.

109
00:05:32.201 --> 00:05:35.639
Mm.

110
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:40.035
An empath.

111
00:05:40.035 --> 00:05:42.690
I found her.

112
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.301
She's trying to push me out.
but I found her.

113
00:05:46.955 --> 00:05:49.087
She has so much anger.

114
00:05:49.087 --> 00:05:50.959
It's overwhelming.

115
00:05:52.308 --> 00:05:54.092
The Red Death's at CCPD.

116
00:05:55.398 --> 00:05:57.531
There are more people there.

117
00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:58.967
They're scared.

118
00:05:58.967 --> 00:06:00.664
That's Kramer
and the other cops.

119
00:06:00.664 --> 00:06:04.102
Wait!
There's somebody else.

120
00:06:04.102 --> 00:06:06.148
Close by. Oh.

121
00:06:06.148 --> 00:06:08.890
Oh! They're in pain.

122
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.066
They're in so much pain.
They're terrified.

123
00:06:11.066 --> 00:06:12.894
Can you see who it is?

124
00:06:12.894 --> 00:06:14.243
Mm-hmm.

125
00:06:14.243 --> 00:06:17.812
Ah! Ahh!

126
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:20.815
- Ah!
- Wait. wait. wait.

127
00:06:20.815 --> 00:06:22.817
I got a location.

128
00:06:22.817 --> 00:06:24.079
Oh. frack me.

129
00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:25.428
Whoever she's locked into

130
00:06:25.428 --> 00:06:27.865
is inside the Red Death's
home base.

131
00:06:32.957 --> 00:06:34.394
Ahh!
- Cecile!

132
00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:36.526
He's alive. he's alive.
he's alive!

133
00:06:36.526 --> 00:06:38.528
He's still alive!

134
00:06:38.528 --> 00:06:40.008
Who?

135
00:06:40.965 --> 00:06:42.402
Mark.

136
00:06:54.065 --> 00:06:55.589
You wanna do what now?

137
00:06:57.634 --> 00:06:59.767
I'm sorry. Barry.
I am not going back there.

138
00:06:59.767 --> 00:07:02.378
It is way too dangerous. and
I have a kid to take care of.

139
00:07:02.378 --> 00:07:04.772
Besides. what if we're there.
and the Red Death comes back?

140
00:07:04.772 --> 00:07:06.338
That's why we need
to get in and out fast

141
00:07:06.338 --> 00:07:07.731
while she's still at CCPD.

142
00:07:07.731 --> 00:07:09.559
No. we need
to do the opposite.

143
00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:11.561
Or at least divide and conquer.

144
00:07:11.561 --> 00:07:13.520
Mark might not survive
much longer.

145
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.348
Did you lose your mind
along with all that speed?

146
00:07:16.348 --> 00:07:18.568
Look. we know
where the enemy is.

147
00:07:18.568 --> 00:07:21.441
This our best chance to take
her down once and for all

148
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:23.747
because she doesn't know
we're coming.

149
00:07:23.747 --> 00:07:25.488
He's right.

150
00:07:25.488 --> 00:07:28.491
Using the element of surprise
is the best option.

151
00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:31.146
The whole city's at stake.
not just one guy.

152
00:07:31.146 --> 00:07:33.365
Hartley. no life
is expendable.

153
00:07:36.412 --> 00:07:38.632
Fine.
If you won't rescue Mark.

154
00:07:38.632 --> 00:07:39.807
then I will.

155
00:07:39.807 --> 00:07:41.461
And I don't even have powers.

156
00:07:45.943 --> 00:07:48.685
Well. looks like the new kid
has more bravery

157
00:07:48.685 --> 00:07:50.165
than the rest of us
put together.

158
00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:55.213
Okay.

159
00:07:55.213 --> 00:07:56.693
Count me in.

160
00:08:00.697 --> 00:08:02.612
All right.

161
00:08:02.612 --> 00:08:04.309
Me too.

162
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:06.660
You have got
to be kidding me.

163
00:08:12.883 --> 00:08:14.232
Fine.

164
00:08:14.232 --> 00:08:15.669
We'll go rescue
six pack blondie.

165
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.238
You better be right about this.

166
00:08:26.723 --> 00:08:28.638
<i>You found Mark. and you
weren't even looking for him.</i>

167
00:08:28.638 --> 00:08:30.901
How's that even possible?

168
00:08:30.901 --> 00:08:32.816
I--

169
00:08:32.816 --> 00:08:35.427
I don't know.

170
00:08:35.427 --> 00:08:37.821
It's--it's like.
the more I use my powers.

171
00:08:37.821 --> 00:08:39.693
the more they grow.

172
00:08:39.693 --> 00:08:43.784
Joe. I can feel them blossoming.

173
00:08:45.307 --> 00:08:46.656
This team is lucky to have

174
00:08:46.656 --> 00:08:48.179
someone as strong as you
in the fight.

175
00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:50.225
Yeah. well.

176
00:08:50.225 --> 00:08:52.444
that's why I gotta
get back out there.

177
00:08:52.444 --> 00:08:54.621
They need me.
- Right now.

178
00:08:54.621 --> 00:08:57.319
they need you to rest.

179
00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:00.583
Is there anything I can do?

180
00:09:00.583 --> 00:09:03.151
When I wake up.

181
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:05.022
I'm probably gonna
be really hungry.

182
00:09:05.022 --> 00:09:08.199
Maybe you can grab me
a bunch of those energy bars.

183
00:09:11.594 --> 00:09:13.204
Yeah.

184
00:09:16.294 --> 00:09:18.122
- Joe.
- Huh?

185
00:09:20.385 --> 00:09:22.474
Babe. are you okay?

186
00:09:22.474 --> 00:09:24.912
Yeah.

187
00:09:24.912 --> 00:09:26.740
I--I'm gonna go check on Jenna.

188
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.480
I'll be back soon.

189
00:09:40.318 --> 00:09:42.669
<i>How much longer?</i>

190
00:09:42.669 --> 00:09:45.149
We are almost there.
Just give us ten minutes.

191
00:09:45.149 --> 00:09:47.195
You have five.

192
00:09:47.195 --> 00:09:49.327
My plan's been delayed
long enough as it is.

193
00:09:53.636 --> 00:09:56.813
Trying to hack our satellite
is a waste of time.

194
00:09:56.813 --> 00:10:00.556
Our latest security upgrade
came courtesy of A.R.G.U.S.

195
00:10:04.647 --> 00:10:07.650
You were saying?

196
00:10:19.183 --> 00:10:21.925
Now that's what I call
an upgrade.

197
00:10:28.236 --> 00:10:30.673
You know.

198
00:10:30.673 --> 00:10:32.936
you should be thanking me. Captain.

199
00:10:34.242 --> 00:10:37.811
The criminals in this world.

200
00:10:37.811 --> 00:10:40.509
they have free rein.

201
00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:44.252
and they go too many times unpunished.

202
00:10:44.252 --> 00:10:46.602
That's on you and your peers.

203
00:10:47.777 --> 00:10:49.823
But soon...

204
00:10:49.823 --> 00:10:55.306
I will have eyes and ears everywhere.

205
00:10:55.306 --> 00:11:01.051
I will be the judge. jury.
and executioner!

206
00:11:04.925 --> 00:11:08.232
<i>Stay in your homes.
Justice is being served.</i>

207
00:11:08.232 --> 00:11:11.845
Welcome to the dawn

208
00:11:11.845 --> 00:11:16.066
of true justice. Captain.

209
00:11:16.066 --> 00:11:18.329
<i>Welcome to the era
of the Red Death.</i>

210
00:11:18.329 --> 00:11:19.766
<i>Stay in your homes.</i>

211
00:11:19.766 --> 00:11:21.811
<i>Justice is being served.</i>

212
00:11:21.811 --> 00:11:23.291
<i>- Stay in your homes.
- Welcome to the era...</i>

213
00:11:23.291 --> 00:11:25.075
<i>Justice is being served.</i>

214
00:11:25.075 --> 00:11:28.949
Welcome to the era

215
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:31.647
of the Red Death.

216
00:11:37.522 --> 00:11:40.221
What are these new signals?
More lightning strikes?

217
00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:42.049
No. Oh. man.

218
00:11:42.049 --> 00:11:44.616
It looks like they're
reservoirs of psychic energy.

219
00:11:44.616 --> 00:11:46.967
It's like they're individual manifestations

220
00:11:46.967 --> 00:11:50.797
of a single telepathic consciousness.

221
00:11:50.797 --> 00:11:52.886
Red Death's getting stronger.

222
00:11:52.886 --> 00:11:54.104
But how's she doing this?

223
00:11:54.104 --> 00:11:55.845
Beats me. but in order

224
00:11:55.845 --> 00:11:58.848
to create these
mental projections.

225
00:11:58.848 --> 00:12:00.937
She's gotta be getting
a neural boost

226
00:12:00.937 --> 00:12:03.548
from some mega powerful
psychic source.

227
00:12:03.548 --> 00:12:05.899
Can you find out what it is?

228
00:12:05.899 --> 00:12:07.944
I'll be in my workshop.

229
00:12:10.599 --> 00:12:12.688
I'm ready.

230
00:12:12.688 --> 00:12:15.996
Khione. look. um...

231
00:12:15.996 --> 00:12:18.346
I know you wanna help
find Mark. but--

232
00:12:18.346 --> 00:12:19.695
Barry. I know
what you're thinking.

233
00:12:19.695 --> 00:12:21.001
But please.
let me come with you.

234
00:12:21.001 --> 00:12:22.306
I promise I won't
get in the way.

235
00:12:22.306 --> 00:12:24.918
You're literally
a few weeks old.

236
00:12:24.918 --> 00:12:27.659
You don't have powers
or even combat training.

237
00:12:27.659 --> 00:12:30.271
I'm sorry. but the answer's no.

238
00:12:30.271 --> 00:12:32.447
You wouldn't be responsible
for me.

239
00:12:32.447 --> 00:12:34.710
I can take care of myself.

240
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.365
I know. But you're also
a part of this team now.

241
00:12:37.365 --> 00:12:39.541
this family.

242
00:12:39.541 --> 00:12:42.152
And we already lost Frost

243
00:12:42.152 --> 00:12:44.938
and Caitlin.

244
00:12:44.938 --> 00:12:46.200
I can't lose you. too.

245
00:12:48.637 --> 00:12:50.682
I hope you understand.
I'm sorry.

246
00:12:50.682 --> 00:12:52.859
I do.

247
00:12:52.859 --> 00:12:54.599
Good luck.

248
00:13:01.302 --> 00:13:03.260
<i>Allegra. how we looking?</i>

249
00:13:05.219 --> 00:13:07.699
Perimeter is secure. Flash.

250
00:13:07.699 --> 00:13:09.136
How can you know that?
You got x-ray vision

251
00:13:09.136 --> 00:13:11.965
or something?
- Yep. I do.

252
00:13:11.965 --> 00:13:13.923
Really?

253
00:13:13.923 --> 00:13:16.230
Nice.

254
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.058
Is that part of the whole
UV manipulation.

255
00:13:18.058 --> 00:13:20.277
glowing hands thing?
- Can we talk about this later?

256
00:13:20.277 --> 00:13:22.584
Sure.

257
00:13:29.025 --> 00:13:32.289
Yeah. this place
isn't creepy.

258
00:13:32.289 --> 00:13:33.421
Wait.

259
00:13:36.598 --> 00:13:38.426
I hear something.

260
00:13:39.427 --> 00:13:41.298
Mark. can you hear me?

261
00:13:41.298 --> 00:13:42.822
Oh. man.

262
00:13:45.781 --> 00:13:47.609
We found him.
He's alive.

263
00:13:47.609 --> 00:13:50.090
You're gonna be okay. Mark.
Just hang on.

264
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.179
Okay. so why'd the Red Death
make this so easy?

265
00:13:52.179 --> 00:13:54.790
I mean. come on. she's been
hella smart up until now.

266
00:13:55.878 --> 00:13:57.271
You know what this feels like. right?

267
00:13:57.271 --> 00:13:58.663
The Human Sizzler's right.

268
00:13:58.663 --> 00:13:59.751
We gotta get
the hell out of here.

269
00:14:07.455 --> 00:14:08.717
Flash...

270
00:14:08.717 --> 00:14:11.328
right on time.

271
00:14:11.328 --> 00:14:13.983
No. no. no. no. no.

272
00:14:13.983 --> 00:14:15.550
Down. boy.

273
00:14:17.421 --> 00:14:20.424
I just wiped out
the last of your speed.

274
00:14:20.424 --> 00:14:22.731
Why do you think
I kept Mark alive?

275
00:14:22.731 --> 00:14:24.515
To draw you in.

276
00:14:24.515 --> 00:14:27.083
So. now. you can't stop me.

277
00:14:27.083 --> 00:14:29.085
The whole world
will feel the vigilance

278
00:14:29.085 --> 00:14:30.739
of my watchful eye.

279
00:14:30.739 --> 00:14:32.306
and if they step out of line.

280
00:14:32.306 --> 00:14:34.482
they'll pay the price
for defying justice.

281
00:14:34.482 --> 00:14:37.398
I'm gonna do what you should've
done in the first place--

282
00:14:37.398 --> 00:14:39.139
eliminate all crime

283
00:14:39.139 --> 00:14:42.620
by erasing it
through my rule of law.

284
00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.231
Those things out there--

285
00:14:44.231 --> 00:14:46.189
My sentinels.

286
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:47.887
<i>Justice is being served.</i>

287
00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:50.193
<i>- Welcome to the era...
- Welcome to the era...</i>

288
00:14:50.193 --> 00:14:51.891
<i>Justice is being served.</i>

289
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:54.850
<i>They'll keep watch
and maintain peace.</i>

290
00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:57.113
One way or another.

291
00:14:57.113 --> 00:15:00.290
They're just
psychic manifestations.

292
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:01.901
They can't hurt anyone.

293
00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:03.380
Oh. Flash.

294
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.209
When Bashir put Savitar
in your mind

295
00:15:06.209 --> 00:15:09.082
to stab you in the chest.
did that hurt?

296
00:15:09.082 --> 00:15:10.822
Ahh!

297
00:15:19.875 --> 00:15:21.311
I almost died.

298
00:15:21.311 --> 00:15:22.834
Mm-hmm. well.

299
00:15:22.834 --> 00:15:26.273
my sentinels
are just as deadly.

300
00:15:26.273 --> 00:15:28.971
I won't let you
hurt this city.

301
00:15:28.971 --> 00:15:30.146
I swear I'll find a way to--

302
00:15:30.146 --> 00:15:32.888
Stop me?

303
00:15:32.888 --> 00:15:35.282
You've served your purpose. Flash.

304
00:15:35.282 --> 00:15:39.025
All of this is because of you.

305
00:15:39.025 --> 00:15:41.723
You made all of this possible

306
00:15:41.723 --> 00:15:43.638
through your greatest mistake!

307
00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.076
What. you don't remember?

308
00:15:47.076 --> 00:15:49.470
Let me refresh your memory.

309
00:15:57.043 --> 00:15:59.219
Ryan!

310
00:15:59.219 --> 00:16:01.047
<i>Don't worry. Flash.</i>

311
00:16:01.047 --> 00:16:03.223
Your pathetic body
is still here with me

312
00:16:03.223 --> 00:16:05.007
in Central City.

313
00:16:05.007 --> 00:16:07.053
<i>I brought your mind here
to show you</i>

314
00:16:07.053 --> 00:16:11.318
<i>how your miserable failure
led to my greatest success.</i>

315
00:16:11.318 --> 00:16:13.363
I know this place.

316
00:16:19.761 --> 00:16:21.241
Grodd?

317
00:16:28.378 --> 00:16:31.381
<i>He can't hear you.
He's connected to me now.</i>

318
00:16:31.381 --> 00:16:34.732
Where is his tribe?

319
00:16:34.732 --> 00:16:37.083
The other gorillas?

320
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:42.044
Last time I saw him.
he was going to find them.

321
00:16:42.044 --> 00:16:44.177
He learned what it meant
to be a hero.

322
00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.791
Ryan.

323
00:16:49.791 --> 00:16:51.227
what have you done to him?

324
00:16:51.227 --> 00:16:52.707
Nothing.

325
00:16:52.707 --> 00:16:54.013
Like I said.

326
00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:57.059
this is your doing. Flash.

327
00:16:57.059 --> 00:16:59.279
<i>After your Crisis.</i>

328
00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:02.586
<i>the gorillas in Gorilla City
lost their sentience</i>

329
00:17:02.586 --> 00:17:06.199
<i>and were scattered
across your lawless world.</i>

330
00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:08.592
<i>Grodd never found his tribe
because you left him</i>

331
00:17:08.592 --> 00:17:12.248
<i>with little more
than a pat on the back.</i>

332
00:17:12.248 --> 00:17:15.251
<i>arrogantly thinking that
teaching him your hero's way</i>

333
00:17:15.251 --> 00:17:17.166
<i>was enough.</i>

334
00:17:17.166 --> 00:17:20.126
<i>It wasn't.</i>

335
00:17:20.126 --> 00:17:22.519
I didn't know.

336
00:17:22.519 --> 00:17:25.653
Because you didn't care.

337
00:17:25.653 --> 00:17:28.003
Which is why your Grodd
took my offer

338
00:17:28.003 --> 00:17:30.223
to help reunite his tribe

339
00:17:30.223 --> 00:17:34.618
in exchange for amplifying
my telepathy.

340
00:17:34.618 --> 00:17:40.320
All because your lessons
of heroism failed him.

341
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.973
Just like it failed you.

342
00:17:43.323 --> 00:17:49.329
Gah!

343
00:18:08.304 --> 00:18:11.002
Mark's alive.
but he's in rough shape.

344
00:18:11.002 --> 00:18:14.310
The Red Death.
she knew we were coming.

345
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.746
It was a trap.

346
00:18:15.746 --> 00:18:18.358
She wanted us to rescue Mark.

347
00:18:18.358 --> 00:18:20.577
She knew she could
defeat us easily.

348
00:18:20.577 --> 00:18:23.232
And that's how Cecile
knew about Mark.

349
00:18:23.232 --> 00:18:24.625
Red Death put the image of him

350
00:18:24.625 --> 00:18:25.887
into her head on purpose.

351
00:18:25.887 --> 00:18:27.018
Damn. she's good.

352
00:18:27.018 --> 00:18:30.587
You skipped the best part.

353
00:18:30.587 --> 00:18:33.242
My speed's gone. too.

354
00:18:33.242 --> 00:18:35.157
It could take hours
to get back this time.

355
00:18:35.157 --> 00:18:36.854
maybe even a day or longer.

356
00:18:36.854 --> 00:18:39.292
Okay. well.
this has been fun.

357
00:18:39.292 --> 00:18:41.555
but with Grodd amplifying
Red Death's

358
00:18:41.555 --> 00:18:43.383
already unstoppable abilities.

359
00:18:43.383 --> 00:18:45.515
I think it's time
we think about survival.

360
00:18:45.515 --> 00:18:47.256
There are hundreds
of sentinels out there.

361
00:18:47.256 --> 00:18:49.171
That's why we need your help
more than ever.

362
00:18:49.171 --> 00:18:51.086
Chester's working on a way
to depower the sentinels.

363
00:18:51.086 --> 00:18:53.044
And has he found it yet?

364
00:18:55.786 --> 00:18:57.179
Didn't think so.

365
00:18:57.179 --> 00:18:59.050
Barry. the Red Death
is this close

366
00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:01.183
to going all Big Sister
on the entire planet.

367
00:19:01.183 --> 00:19:02.880
I don't get it.
Why is she doing this

368
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.360
in the first place?
- It's her idea of justice.

369
00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.579
That's why we need to find
another way to--

370
00:19:05.579 --> 00:19:09.365
Enough!

371
00:19:09.365 --> 00:19:11.846
It's over.

372
00:19:11.846 --> 00:19:13.543
and we lost.

373
00:19:15.023 --> 00:19:18.287
All right. well.
I'm gonna go home

374
00:19:18.287 --> 00:19:20.550
and protect my son
as long as I can.

375
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.034
Sorry. Allen.

376
00:19:26.034 --> 00:19:28.079
If I'm gonna die.

377
00:19:28.079 --> 00:19:30.473
it's gonna be with
the man that I love.

378
00:19:32.475 --> 00:19:33.998
Guess I'll go
to Iron Heights.

379
00:19:33.998 --> 00:19:36.262
apologize to Amunet.

380
00:19:36.262 --> 00:19:38.655
Maybe she'll forgive me
before we all die.

381
00:19:41.615 --> 00:19:43.617
Good luck. Chemist.

382
00:19:45.096 --> 00:19:47.316
You're gonna need it.

383
00:19:58.284 --> 00:20:00.199
How is he?

384
00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:02.723
Stable.
but still unconscious.

385
00:20:05.552 --> 00:20:07.902
I just--I feel so useless.

386
00:20:07.902 --> 00:20:10.992
I mean. Caitlin would've been
able to help Mark.

387
00:20:10.992 --> 00:20:13.821
Frost would've been
out there fighting.

388
00:20:13.821 --> 00:20:15.910
You're still valuable
to the team.

389
00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:17.433
Really? How?

390
00:20:17.433 --> 00:20:19.261
Well. I don't have
any powers.

391
00:20:19.261 --> 00:20:22.308
But when S.T.A.R. Labs has been
under attack in the past.

392
00:20:22.308 --> 00:20:25.659
I grab my pulse rifle.
and I fight back.

393
00:20:25.659 --> 00:20:27.922
Are you suggesting
I should get a weapon?

394
00:20:29.619 --> 00:20:31.491
What I'm saying is that
even though

395
00:20:31.491 --> 00:20:34.450
you may not feel like it yet.
you have a place here. too.

396
00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.758
You just have to find
what you're looking for.

397
00:20:37.758 --> 00:20:39.281
Listen to your heart.

398
00:20:39.281 --> 00:20:40.891
Right.

399
00:20:40.891 --> 00:20:42.806
Just like an acorn
doesn't grow up

400
00:20:42.806 --> 00:20:46.636
knowing that it's meant
to be a majestic oak.

401
00:20:46.636 --> 00:20:48.682
but it finds its way.

402
00:20:48.682 --> 00:20:50.031
Which means--

403
00:20:50.031 --> 00:20:51.815
You can. too.

404
00:21:00.171 --> 00:21:02.348
Mark.

405
00:21:02.348 --> 00:21:04.915
you need to wake up.

406
00:21:29.505 --> 00:21:31.115
Did it just get cold in here?

407
00:21:31.115 --> 00:21:34.467
Huh. actually...

408
00:21:34.467 --> 00:21:37.121
I'm feeling kinda warm.

409
00:21:54.922 --> 00:21:57.925
You look just like I feel.

410
00:22:01.276 --> 00:22:03.887
Joe. how'd we get here?

411
00:22:03.887 --> 00:22:06.455
The Red Death's
taken over the city.

412
00:22:06.455 --> 00:22:09.110
My speed's gone.

413
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:11.112
Ryan and her team
are in total sync.

414
00:22:11.112 --> 00:22:12.853
while mine's fallen apart.

415
00:22:12.853 --> 00:22:16.726
I mean. following my lead
has been a disaster lately.

416
00:22:16.726 --> 00:22:19.468
Now Grodd's helping
the Red Death boost her powers.

417
00:22:19.468 --> 00:22:22.079
Damn. Grodd's back. too?

418
00:22:22.079 --> 00:22:23.733
Yeah.

419
00:22:23.733 --> 00:22:26.345
He's working with Ryan now.
thanks to me.

420
00:22:26.345 --> 00:22:29.652
Didn't you tell me
that the last time you saw him.

421
00:22:29.652 --> 00:22:33.917
he'd learned how to be a hero
from your example?

422
00:22:33.917 --> 00:22:36.659
Yeah. I thought I saw
the good in him.

423
00:22:36.659 --> 00:22:38.966
how he changed.

424
00:22:38.966 --> 00:22:41.969
Just like I thought I saw it
in Hartley. Jaco. and Goldface.

425
00:22:41.969 --> 00:22:46.103
But I guess I was wrong
about all of 'em.

426
00:22:46.103 --> 00:22:48.367
Mm-mm.

427
00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:50.543
If there's one thing I'm sure
of after all these years.

428
00:22:50.543 --> 00:22:52.458
it's you have a gift

429
00:22:52.458 --> 00:22:55.591
for bringing out the good
in folks.

430
00:22:55.591 --> 00:22:58.812
no matter how bad
they started out.

431
00:22:58.812 --> 00:23:02.642
Well. if that's true.
I learned it from you.

432
00:23:02.642 --> 00:23:04.557
Maybe.

433
00:23:04.557 --> 00:23:07.081
Either way...

434
00:23:07.081 --> 00:23:11.607
I have run out of things
that I need to teach you.

435
00:23:13.914 --> 00:23:17.396
Just like I don't need
to protect Cecile anymore.

436
00:23:17.396 --> 00:23:21.443
considering how much
her powers have grown.

437
00:23:23.706 --> 00:23:25.360
I should tell you.

438
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.058
up until a couple of days ago.

439
00:23:28.058 --> 00:23:32.498
Cecile and I were talking about
moving out of Central City

440
00:23:32.498 --> 00:23:34.021
to the country for good.

441
00:23:34.021 --> 00:23:35.414
- What?
- It's okay.

442
00:23:35.414 --> 00:23:37.198
We decided to stay.

443
00:23:37.198 --> 00:23:40.767
And it's a good thing because
the team needs her here.

444
00:23:42.986 --> 00:23:44.423
We need you. too.

445
00:23:44.423 --> 00:23:46.468
No. you don't.
I'm not a cop anymore.

446
00:23:46.468 --> 00:23:48.601
and I'm not a meta.
so what am I doing here?

447
00:23:48.601 --> 00:23:51.212
Joe...

448
00:23:51.212 --> 00:23:54.433
no one is more important
to this team--

449
00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:57.740
to this family--
than you.

450
00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:01.309
I mean. think of all the heroes

451
00:24:01.309 --> 00:24:04.312
you've raised over the years.

452
00:24:04.312 --> 00:24:05.792
We couldn't do what we do

453
00:24:05.792 --> 00:24:09.709
if we didn't have you
to teach us how.

454
00:24:09.709 --> 00:24:13.887
Inspiring people
is your super power.

455
00:24:13.887 --> 00:24:16.890
That's nice.

456
00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:20.328
But if it's my super power.
it's yours. too. Barry.

457
00:24:20.328 --> 00:24:22.112
'Cause you've inspired me.

458
00:24:22.112 --> 00:24:27.074
What I learned
about being a parent

459
00:24:27.074 --> 00:24:30.120
is whatever seeds
we've planted.

460
00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.166
we have to trust
that they take root.

461
00:24:32.166 --> 00:24:35.430
no matter how dark things get.

462
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:40.740
So you have faith in your way
of being a hero.

463
00:24:42.785 --> 00:24:47.137
If you do that.
you'll always find your way

464
00:24:47.137 --> 00:24:49.096
and those who follow you
will. too.

465
00:24:50.793 --> 00:24:52.752
That's it.

466
00:24:52.752 --> 00:24:56.930
Three years ago. I taught Grodd
how to be a hero.

467
00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:01.238
Now I need to believe
that deep down he still is.

468
00:25:01.238 --> 00:25:03.850
Because I can't stop
the Red Death without him.

469
00:25:07.854 --> 00:25:09.856
Hey. you were right. Bar.

470
00:25:09.856 --> 00:25:11.597
I just found
a telepathic signal.

471
00:25:11.597 --> 00:25:13.076
It's in the Serengeti.

472
00:25:13.076 --> 00:25:15.339
- You sure that's Grodd?
- Positive.

473
00:25:15.339 --> 00:25:17.167
Hey. look. you do realize

474
00:25:17.167 --> 00:25:19.779
that if you try to do this
without your speed.

475
00:25:19.779 --> 00:25:21.607
I mean. Grodd could kill you.

476
00:25:21.607 --> 00:25:24.087
Not if Barry's right
about Grodd.

477
00:25:24.087 --> 00:25:26.263
We just have to have faith
that he is.

478
00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:46.849
Flash. you finally came back

479
00:25:46.849 --> 00:25:49.286
after you abandoned Grodd.

480
00:25:49.286 --> 00:25:51.680
I know...

481
00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.812
and I'm sorry.

482
00:25:52.812 --> 00:25:54.509
Give Grodd one reason

483
00:25:54.509 --> 00:25:57.773
why he shouldn't kill you
right now.

484
00:25:59.079 --> 00:26:01.560
Because I need your help
to save the world.

485
00:26:12.005 --> 00:26:14.921
<i>You have violated
the laws of this city.</i>

486
00:26:14.921 --> 00:26:17.314
<i>Justice will now be served.</i>

487
00:26:19.534 --> 00:26:21.841
Why should Grodd help you?

488
00:26:21.841 --> 00:26:23.799
You abandoned us!

489
00:26:23.799 --> 00:26:25.671
You're right.

490
00:26:25.671 --> 00:26:27.977
I did.

491
00:26:27.977 --> 00:26:30.153
I know that's why
you're helping the Red Death

492
00:26:30.153 --> 00:26:33.156
amplify her telepathic hold.

493
00:26:33.156 --> 00:26:37.204
But I'm asking you to stop
right now.

494
00:26:37.204 --> 00:26:39.510
People are dying.

495
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:41.687
You know this is
the wrong thing to do.

496
00:26:41.687 --> 00:26:44.080
Grodd has no choice.

497
00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.302
The Red Death offered Grodd
a way to rebuild our home.

498
00:26:48.302 --> 00:26:50.086
Grodd.

499
00:26:50.086 --> 00:26:54.917
you are the most powerful
telepath on the planet.

500
00:26:54.917 --> 00:26:58.399
You must've looked inside
the Red Death's mind.

501
00:26:58.399 --> 00:27:01.968
You know what she's capable of.

502
00:27:01.968 --> 00:27:04.144
Once she's done with you.

503
00:27:04.144 --> 00:27:06.015
what's gonna stop her
from turning on you

504
00:27:06.015 --> 00:27:07.887
and your gorillas?

505
00:27:07.887 --> 00:27:09.628
Why take that chance?

506
00:27:09.628 --> 00:27:15.068
Grodd has been alone
for three long years. Flash.

507
00:27:15.068 --> 00:27:18.158
He tried to find
other intelligent gorillas.

508
00:27:18.158 --> 00:27:20.073
but only found strangers

509
00:27:20.073 --> 00:27:23.946
no longer possessing
a mind like Grodd's.

510
00:27:23.946 --> 00:27:30.300
The Red Death is the only one
who can help Grodd fix this.

511
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.955
Grodd. if we have hope.

512
00:27:32.955 --> 00:27:35.871
there's always another way.

513
00:27:35.871 --> 00:27:39.092
And I'll help you find it.

514
00:27:39.092 --> 00:27:41.268
But right now.

515
00:27:41.268 --> 00:27:46.490
I need you to help me
to defeat her

516
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:50.277
by being the hero
I know you already are.

517
00:27:55.238 --> 00:27:58.546
Australia. Japan. Iceland--
she's everywhere.

518
00:27:58.546 --> 00:28:01.505
- Like a plague.
- Or like a global invasion.

519
00:28:01.505 --> 00:28:03.682
What was that?

520
00:28:03.682 --> 00:28:06.902
I don't know.
Hold up.

521
00:28:06.902 --> 00:28:09.035
Okay. I'm getting a surge
of psychic energy

522
00:28:09.035 --> 00:28:10.993
coming out of Africa.

523
00:28:10.993 --> 00:28:14.344
mixed with
Speed Force lightning?

524
00:28:16.477 --> 00:28:19.088
Is that supposed to happen?

525
00:28:26.792 --> 00:28:29.098
No. no. no. no. no!

526
00:28:29.098 --> 00:28:31.057
This can't be happening!

527
00:28:42.329 --> 00:28:45.114
Flash...

528
00:28:45.114 --> 00:28:46.855
you ruined it all.

529
00:28:48.291 --> 00:28:50.859
I will bring justice
to this world!

530
00:28:52.905 --> 00:28:55.168
Where are you. Flash?

531
00:28:55.168 --> 00:28:57.170
Come and face me!

532
00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.825
Or are you just like
the others--

533
00:28:59.825 --> 00:29:02.653
afraid to face final justice?

534
00:29:09.486 --> 00:29:12.185
You got your speed back
already?

535
00:29:12.185 --> 00:29:13.882
But that's impossible.

536
00:29:13.882 --> 00:29:17.538
A long time ago.
I gave a gift to a friend.

537
00:29:17.538 --> 00:29:20.541
Grodd is ready.

538
00:29:27.548 --> 00:29:29.071
Today. he returned the favor.

539
00:29:29.071 --> 00:29:32.205
You took Grodd's mind
away from me.

540
00:29:32.205 --> 00:29:35.861
You poisoned another Rogue
to use against me.

541
00:29:35.861 --> 00:29:38.733
Why do you keep
ruining my life. Flash?

542
00:29:38.733 --> 00:29:41.127
You think it's bad now.

543
00:29:41.127 --> 00:29:42.781
wait'll you taste the food
at Iron Heights.

544
00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:45.087
No. it can't end like this.

545
00:29:45.087 --> 00:29:46.610
I won't let it!

546
00:30:46.627 --> 00:30:48.194
First I took your speed.

547
00:30:48.194 --> 00:30:50.022
now I'll take your life.

548
00:30:50.022 --> 00:30:53.460
And justice will be served!

549
00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.636
Sorry. sister.
He's taken.

550
00:30:55.636 --> 00:30:57.812
We're the only ones
who get to whoop on the Flash.

551
00:31:12.348 --> 00:31:16.135
Now. it will end.

552
00:31:16.135 --> 00:31:20.095
Ah!

553
00:31:38.592 --> 00:31:40.159
That should nullify
your speed enough

554
00:31:40.159 --> 00:31:42.944
for me to see
what you're really made of.

555
00:31:42.944 --> 00:31:45.294
Bring it on. Bats.

556
00:31:57.437 --> 00:31:59.526
Ahh!

557
00:32:09.492 --> 00:32:11.320
You can't beat yourself.

558
00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.062
I know everything you're
going to do before you do it.

559
00:32:14.062 --> 00:32:16.935
Girl. you're nothing but me
on a bad hair day.

560
00:32:18.284 --> 00:32:20.590
And I don't have to beat you.

561
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:22.070
'cause I'm not alone.

562
00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:38.565
Now stay down.

563
00:32:40.262 --> 00:32:42.047
Nice move. Flash.

564
00:32:42.047 --> 00:32:44.745
Sorry I'm late.
- That's not late.

565
00:32:44.745 --> 00:32:47.530
That's making an entrance.

566
00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:49.924
Wait a minute.
I thought you're the bad guys.

567
00:32:50.794 --> 00:32:51.752
So did we.

568
00:32:51.752 --> 00:32:53.145
Thank you.

569
00:32:53.145 --> 00:32:54.537
Oh. anytime.

570
00:32:54.537 --> 00:32:56.713
Well. not. like. anytime.

571
00:32:56.713 --> 00:32:59.629
- Oh. anytime.
- Okay. fine. Whatever.

572
00:32:59.629 --> 00:33:02.545
So. Flash. never been to
Central City.

573
00:33:02.545 --> 00:33:03.894
Is it always this crazy?

574
00:33:03.894 --> 00:33:06.201
Well--

575
00:33:06.201 --> 00:33:07.898
It's a Wednesday.

576
00:33:16.342 --> 00:33:18.997
Okay. you were. like--
you were. like. so dope.

577
00:33:18.997 --> 00:33:21.390
Okay. seriously. seriously.
like. the level with which

578
00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:23.131
your badassery extends to
is. like.

579
00:33:23.131 --> 00:33:24.611
beyond what I can comprehend.

580
00:33:24.611 --> 00:33:25.916
It doesn't even make sense
to my brain.

581
00:33:25.916 --> 00:33:27.048
Like. I can't even
really compute--

582
00:33:27.048 --> 00:33:28.441
What Chester is trying to say

583
00:33:28.441 --> 00:33:29.616
is thank you so much
for your help.

584
00:33:29.616 --> 00:33:32.053
Hey. it's what I do.

585
00:33:32.053 --> 00:33:33.750
A.R.G.U.S.
has the Red Death in custody

586
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:35.230
and they know she was from
another timeline.

587
00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:37.102
so you and your identity
are still safe.

588
00:33:37.102 --> 00:33:39.278
Thank you. And I heard
you were running low.

589
00:33:39.278 --> 00:33:40.627
How'd you get your speed back?

590
00:33:40.627 --> 00:33:43.151
Three years ago.
I gave a spark

591
00:33:43.151 --> 00:33:46.328
of my Speed Force to
a sentient gorilla...

592
00:33:48.591 --> 00:33:51.594
And it was still inside
his mind this whole time.

593
00:33:53.379 --> 00:33:54.945
Is Grodd actually
a good guy now?

594
00:33:54.945 --> 00:33:57.383
I think so.
And more determined than ever

595
00:33:57.383 --> 00:33:59.776
to rekindle the spark
of intelligence in his tribe.

596
00:33:59.776 --> 00:34:01.213
I even re-tasked
our satellites

597
00:34:01.213 --> 00:34:03.563
to help search for his gorillas
24/7.

598
00:34:03.563 --> 00:34:06.261
Well. I should be
getting back to Gotham City.

599
00:34:06.261 --> 00:34:08.350
and I appreciate you all
looking for me.

600
00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:09.873
Especially you. Iris.

601
00:34:09.873 --> 00:34:12.267
I'm a big fan of your work.

602
00:34:12.267 --> 00:34:13.921
Really?

603
00:34:13.921 --> 00:34:16.576
Wow--I mean. yeah. likewise.

604
00:34:16.576 --> 00:34:19.535
Although I have to say. I like
you better than the other one.

605
00:34:19.535 --> 00:34:22.625
Yeah. Sorry about the whole
doppelganger situation.

606
00:34:22.625 --> 00:34:23.887
But the next time
you're in Gotham.

607
00:34:23.887 --> 00:34:25.019
we should get a mimosa.

608
00:34:25.019 --> 00:34:26.368
Kara. Alex. Nia. and I.

609
00:34:26.368 --> 00:34:27.848
we all have a monthly brunch.

610
00:34:27.848 --> 00:34:30.242
- Yeah. I would love that.
- All right.

611
00:34:30.242 --> 00:34:32.026
Well. it was great
meeting you all.

612
00:34:32.026 --> 00:34:33.984
And if you ever need me again. Flash.

613
00:34:33.984 --> 00:34:35.290
you know where to find me.

614
00:34:43.255 --> 00:34:46.432
So. looks like
I missed all the fun. huh?

615
00:34:46.432 --> 00:34:50.349
If by fun you mean
saving the world again

616
00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:53.178
from a big bad
hell bent on world conquest...

617
00:34:53.178 --> 00:34:54.440
- Mm-hmm.
- Yep.

618
00:34:56.877 --> 00:34:58.661
I'm just glad
you're all right.

619
00:34:58.661 --> 00:34:59.923
Yeah?

620
00:35:01.708 --> 00:35:04.145
Then what's all that anxiety
you're feeling?

621
00:35:05.364 --> 00:35:10.586
Today. Barry reminded me of

622
00:35:10.586 --> 00:35:15.069
the most meaningful thing
I've ever done.

623
00:35:15.069 --> 00:35:19.073
And that's being a parent.

624
00:35:19.073 --> 00:35:23.947
And I have the chance
to do that one more time.

625
00:35:23.947 --> 00:35:26.689
and I just wanna get it right.

626
00:35:26.689 --> 00:35:28.561
Well. good news. babe.
You're already doing that.

627
00:35:28.561 --> 00:35:32.130
Mm. There's so much...

628
00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:37.091
stress and strife in our lives.

629
00:35:37.091 --> 00:35:40.312
I'm gonna shield Jenna
from all of that.

630
00:35:44.968 --> 00:35:47.493
You still want
our family to move.

631
00:35:48.842 --> 00:35:52.846
Not our whole family.
Just me and Jenna.

632
00:35:52.846 --> 00:35:54.848
- What?
- Hear me out.

633
00:35:54.848 --> 00:36:00.332
Cecile. you are the hero

634
00:36:00.332 --> 00:36:03.639
Team Flash needs right now.

635
00:36:03.639 --> 00:36:07.426
I cannot ask you
to turn your back on that.

636
00:36:10.037 --> 00:36:11.778
Well. then.
what are we supposed to do?

637
00:36:11.778 --> 00:36:17.740
You come to the country
on the weekends.

638
00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:22.223
That way. me and Jenna
have you all to ourselves.

639
00:36:22.223 --> 00:36:25.052
If anything. we have more
quality time than we do now.

640
00:36:25.052 --> 00:36:27.750
I--

641
00:36:30.623 --> 00:36:33.365
Like. the--the--
just the three of us?

642
00:36:33.365 --> 00:36:34.844
Mm.

643
00:36:34.844 --> 00:36:36.324
Out in the country?

644
00:36:36.324 --> 00:36:37.891
- No alarms?
- Nope.

645
00:36:37.891 --> 00:36:40.328
- No craziness?
- No.

646
00:36:40.328 --> 00:36:42.678
- Just us.
- Mm-hmm.

647
00:36:43.897 --> 00:36:46.595
That actually sounds...

648
00:36:46.595 --> 00:36:47.727
perfect.

649
00:36:49.468 --> 00:36:50.860
Oh. we have a plan!

650
00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.122
I love you!

651
00:36:52.122 --> 00:36:54.647
I love you so much.

652
00:37:05.048 --> 00:37:07.616
- Queen. king...
- Oh.

653
00:37:07.616 --> 00:37:10.315
- Ace of spades.
- Winner. winner!

654
00:37:10.315 --> 00:37:11.751
I hope y'all packed your bags

655
00:37:11.751 --> 00:37:15.102
'cause I'm taking you
to Boston!

656
00:37:15.102 --> 00:37:17.147
You sorry bunch of moth--
- Joe!

657
00:37:17.147 --> 00:37:19.541
- I was gonna say friends.
- Mm-hmm.

658
00:37:19.541 --> 00:37:21.717
And family.

659
00:37:21.717 --> 00:37:24.938
Yo. speaking of family.
let me do this.

660
00:37:24.938 --> 00:37:27.419
I just wanna thank you all
for coming.

661
00:37:27.419 --> 00:37:30.073
After all these years of
making Central City my home.

662
00:37:30.073 --> 00:37:31.379
I can't quite believe
that this journey

663
00:37:31.379 --> 00:37:32.772
is coming to an end.

664
00:37:32.772 --> 00:37:34.861
but it makes it easier
to step away

665
00:37:34.861 --> 00:37:38.299
when I know the city
is in great hands.

666
00:37:38.299 --> 00:37:40.954
And not just Barry's--

667
00:37:40.954 --> 00:37:43.173
all of yours.

668
00:37:43.173 --> 00:37:46.307
I feel--I feel so blessed

669
00:37:46.307 --> 00:37:50.659
to leave behind
such an incredible legacy.

670
00:37:55.142 --> 00:37:56.752
Damn.

671
00:37:59.451 --> 00:38:04.238
Just--I'm gonna miss
seeing you guys every day.

672
00:38:04.238 --> 00:38:08.634
Um--but know this:

673
00:38:08.634 --> 00:38:10.679
I love you.

674
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:15.554
If you every forget that.

675
00:38:15.554 --> 00:38:17.164
I'm just a phone call away.

676
00:38:18.774 --> 00:38:23.213
Or a quick fathwoom.

677
00:38:23.213 --> 00:38:25.041
Yeah.

678
00:38:25.041 --> 00:38:26.913
To Joe West.

679
00:38:26.913 --> 00:38:29.002
And to raising
a new generation of heroes.

680
00:38:29.002 --> 00:38:30.177
Mm.

681
00:38:57.857 --> 00:38:58.988
I'm glad you're doing better.

682
00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.167
Thanks for coming back for me
like that.

683
00:39:04.167 --> 00:39:06.561
I--

684
00:39:06.561 --> 00:39:08.955
I'm just not really sure
I deserve to be here.

685
00:39:08.955 --> 00:39:12.132
you know. with--
- Mark.

686
00:39:12.132 --> 00:39:15.875
like I told you before.
you're one of us now.

687
00:39:15.875 --> 00:39:17.355
which makes you family.

688
00:39:19.792 --> 00:39:23.448
You deserve to be here
as much as any of us.

689
00:39:28.104 --> 00:39:31.717
So. you know how we said

690
00:39:31.717 --> 00:39:34.415
we weren't gonna
talk about anything

691
00:39:34.415 --> 00:39:38.680
until after this whole
Rogue thing was over?

692
00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.813
Yeah.

693
00:39:40.813 --> 00:39:44.773
Well. now it is. and--

694
00:39:44.773 --> 00:39:47.776
so--

695
00:39:47.776 --> 00:39:50.083
well--

696
00:39:50.083 --> 00:39:52.694
Chuck. that was the best kiss
I've ever had.

697
00:39:56.176 --> 00:39:57.830
Hm.

698
00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:01.616
Then. uh...

699
00:40:01.616 --> 00:40:04.619
I guess there's only
one thing left to do.

700
00:40:20.374 --> 00:40:22.289
Ooh. I am glad that

701
00:40:22.289 --> 00:40:24.422
Jenna is upstairs asleep.
- Yeah.

702
00:40:35.911 --> 00:40:37.652
When did this happen?

703
00:40:37.652 --> 00:40:40.829
I think a better question is:
what took so long?

704
00:40:44.354 --> 00:40:46.313
- You all right?
- Yeah.

705
00:40:46.313 --> 00:40:48.968
Sorry. I'm fine. I just--
I feel a little lightheaded.

706
00:40:50.839 --> 00:40:52.580
Gosh. that's so weird. I don't
know why I feel that way.

707
00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:54.016
Sorry.

708
00:40:54.016 --> 00:40:56.323
I do.
You're pregnant.

709
00:41:04.679 --> 00:41:06.681
Oh. you--you didn't know?

710
00:41:06.681 --> 00:41:08.814
Oh. I'm so sorry.

711
00:41:08.814 --> 00:41:10.903
Um--

712
00:41:10.903 --> 00:41:12.861
congratulations.

713
00:41:15.211 --> 00:41:17.866
I mean. it's not supposed
to be for another three months.

714
00:41:17.866 --> 00:41:20.347
I--I guess this means
things really are changing.

715
00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:29.051
Well. congratulations.
you guys!

716
00:41:29.051 --> 00:41:31.053
Oh. my God. Oh. my God.
Oh. my God.

717
00:41:31.053 --> 00:41:33.012
Could she possibly know that?

718
00:41:33.012 --> 00:41:34.883
- How could you know?
- I just do.

719
00:42:07.133 --> 00:42:08.613
Greg. move your head.
