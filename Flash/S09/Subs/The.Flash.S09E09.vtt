<i>This whole thing is going to
be awesome. awesome. awesome.</i>

2
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:06.136
I'm telling you.

3
00:00:06.136 --> 00:00:08.312
Thirty. Flirty. and Thriving

4
00:00:08.312 --> 00:00:10.880
is going to be one memorable
shindig--I can feel it.

5
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.273
Yeah. and from
what you told me.

6
00:00:12.273 --> 00:00:13.839
it sounds like it's going to be

7
00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:15.145
way better than the first time
Barry turned 30.

8
00:00:15.145 --> 00:00:17.060
Oh. yeah.
that time Team Flash

9
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.627
spent the whole night
fighting Cicada.

10
00:00:18.627 --> 00:00:20.194
Well. thanks
to Dr. Orloff's gamma ray.

11
00:00:20.194 --> 00:00:21.934
Barry's got a second crack
at it.

12
00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:24.459
'cause on a cellular level.
he's still just 29.

13
00:00:26.243 --> 00:00:27.723
<i>Hey. what happened?</i>

14
00:00:27.723 --> 00:00:29.159
<i>My readings
are saying that you're--</i>

15
00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:30.726
Better than ever.

16
00:00:30.726 --> 00:00:32.728
Okay. so as far as everything
else goes.

17
00:00:32.728 --> 00:00:34.425
I mean. I think we're good.

18
00:00:34.425 --> 00:00:36.297
Chester. you are still
in charge of entertainment.

19
00:00:36.297 --> 00:00:38.125
Allegra. you and I have already
done all the decorating.

20
00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:40.475
Khione is picking up
the cake. so...

21
00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:42.520
Do you guys think he's
going to be surprised?

22
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.218
He better be.

23
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.050
Okay. I just need
to grab my laptop.

24
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.443
all:
Surprise!

25
00:00:55.403 --> 00:00:58.493
Wally. Dig...

26
00:00:58.493 --> 00:00:59.755
You guys got me.

27
00:00:59.755 --> 00:01:01.322
Come here. man.

28
00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:03.541
Happy birthday.
- Thanks. Good to see you.

29
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:05.543
May your current rotation
around the sun

30
00:01:05.543 --> 00:01:08.459
be your best yet.
- Okay.

31
00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:10.679
Thank you.
Guys!

32
00:01:32.396 --> 00:01:36.226
Yo. party people.
let's get wild!

33
00:01:38.185 --> 00:01:40.143
It's got dried sendru
and honey.

34
00:01:40.143 --> 00:01:42.014
It'll be good for
your morning sickness. I hope.

35
00:01:42.014 --> 00:01:43.799
and it tastes delicious.

36
00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.670
- Okay. cheers.
- Cheers.

37
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.237
- Mmm.
- Oh. yeah?

38
00:01:47.237 --> 00:01:48.673
- Barry. you have to try this.
- Oh. yeah?

39
00:01:48.673 --> 00:01:50.806
Excuse us.
Barry. happy birthday.

40
00:01:50.806 --> 00:01:52.199
Can you settle
something for us?

41
00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:53.765
Sure.

42
00:01:53.765 --> 00:01:55.854
See. I think I was
a better CCPD captain

43
00:01:55.854 --> 00:01:57.900
because I'm not a meta-human.
- Oh.

44
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.423
It keeps me objective.

45
00:01:59.423 --> 00:02:01.338
Chief. having
meta-abilities gives me

46
00:02:01.338 --> 00:02:03.253
a better understanding of what
meta-criminals go through

47
00:02:03.253 --> 00:02:04.689
and how they're thinking.

48
00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.343
Being human
implies I'm treating

49
00:02:06.343 --> 00:02:08.215
meta-criminals
and non-meta-criminals equally.

50
00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:10.521
Actually. it
implies you're more biased

51
00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:13.307
because non-metas set up
the system in the first place.

52
00:02:13.307 --> 00:02:15.004
both:
What do you think?

53
00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:17.833
Um. that...

54
00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:22.054
Central City
is lucky to have you both.

55
00:02:22.054 --> 00:02:24.622
Okay. okay. do you guys mind
if I borrow the man

56
00:02:24.622 --> 00:02:25.797
of the hour for a moment?

57
00:02:25.797 --> 00:02:27.538
I have a special gift for him.

58
00:02:27.538 --> 00:02:29.801
How does it feel being
30 all over again?

59
00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:31.455
Unreal. I guess.

60
00:02:31.455 --> 00:02:33.196
Because it's special.
Barry. which means it

61
00:02:33.196 --> 00:02:35.416
requires a special gift.

62
00:02:35.416 --> 00:02:38.027
- Dig. I--
- No. no. please. open it.

63
00:02:44.076 --> 00:02:46.383
We thought we lost it when
Earth-38 was destroyed.

64
00:02:46.383 --> 00:02:48.298
But A.R.G.U.S. Found
it in National City.

65
00:02:53.956 --> 00:02:56.567
It's hard to believe
it's been three years. right?

66
00:02:56.567 --> 00:02:58.569
Sometimes I'll be at
the grocery store. man.

67
00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.355
or with my kids. and. uh...

68
00:03:01.355 --> 00:03:04.140
grief will hit
me all over again.

69
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:08.449
Yeah.

70
00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:10.190
It's hard.

71
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.280
We don't get the chance
to say goodbye to someone.

72
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.412
I'm sorry to hear
about Caitlin.

73
00:03:15.412 --> 00:03:17.588
losing her so soon after Frost.

74
00:03:17.588 --> 00:03:19.938
Eh. having Khione's helped.

75
00:03:19.938 --> 00:03:23.855
But something about it all
still just doesn't feel right.

76
00:03:25.161 --> 00:03:27.816
That's why
I-I can't accept this.

77
00:03:27.816 --> 00:03:29.905
Barry. Oliver would have
wanted you to have this.

78
00:03:29.905 --> 00:03:31.515
I'm sorry. Dig.

79
00:03:31.515 --> 00:03:35.476
Maybe we should just
display it in the hall.

80
00:03:39.044 --> 00:03:41.395
Does Khione need
help with the cake?

81
00:03:41.395 --> 00:03:43.135
Oh. she said there's
a huge line at the bakery.

82
00:03:43.135 --> 00:03:45.660
So I figured.
while we're waiting.

83
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.967
I might as well give you this.

84
00:03:48.967 --> 00:03:51.361
You know it's not
my birthday. right?

85
00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:53.407
It's just a little
something that I made you

86
00:03:53.407 --> 00:03:57.062
for our one-month anniversary.

87
00:03:57.062 --> 00:03:59.064
It's beautiful.

88
00:03:59.064 --> 00:04:00.892
And it's not just for show.

89
00:04:00.892 --> 00:04:03.199
I know you've been worried
about the "light meta" buzz.

90
00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:05.941
so I designed this
to conceal your identity.

91
00:04:05.941 --> 00:04:08.639
It's got a facial
transmogrifier inside it.

92
00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.772
This way. you can
concentrate on using

93
00:04:10.772 --> 00:04:13.165
all your powers to kick ass

94
00:04:13.165 --> 00:04:16.125
and not on trying
to hide your face.

95
00:04:16.125 --> 00:04:19.476
Thanks.
That'll come in handy.

96
00:04:19.476 --> 00:04:21.739
Plus. now got
a little piece of me

97
00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.394
keeping you safe out there.

98
00:04:24.394 --> 00:04:25.874
I love it.

99
00:04:25.874 --> 00:04:27.571
And I love you. too.

100
00:04:32.402 --> 00:04:33.621
♪ Yo. I'll tell you
what I want ♪

101
00:04:33.621 --> 00:04:35.753
♪ What I really. really want ♪

102
00:04:35.753 --> 00:04:37.799

103

104

what you really. really want ♪

105
00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:43.718
That's a hit.

106
00:04:43.718 --> 00:04:45.763
both:
♪ I wanna. I wanna. I wanna ♪

107
00:04:45.763 --> 00:04:47.852
♪ I wanna really. really.
really wanna zigazag. ah ♪

108
00:04:47.852 --> 00:04:50.551
You know
there's a whole party

109
00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:53.467
going on in there. right?

110
00:04:53.467 --> 00:04:55.469
I just needed some air.
- Hmm.

111
00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:57.558
Hey. thanks for coming
all the way for this.

112
00:04:57.558 --> 00:04:58.994
How are the Himalayas?

113
00:04:58.994 --> 00:05:01.213
Well. Bakinimal
has been helping me a lot

114
00:05:01.213 --> 00:05:03.738
with my journey to
enlightenment. which is good.

115
00:05:03.738 --> 00:05:06.131
Um. but when Iris told me
about the Red Death.

116
00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:07.655
it kind of gave me an idea.

117
00:05:07.655 --> 00:05:09.700
You know how I can
project my consciousness

118
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.398
into the Speed Force?

119
00:05:11.398 --> 00:05:14.444
Well. I've been doing it
to find alternate timelines.

120
00:05:14.444 --> 00:05:15.793
What for?

121
00:05:15.793 --> 00:05:17.186
Since there are
other timelines.

122
00:05:17.186 --> 00:05:18.622
there's probably
another me out there

123
00:05:18.622 --> 00:05:20.798
who has already
achieved enlightenment

124
00:05:20.798 --> 00:05:22.844
and could help me find it. too.
- Wow.

125
00:05:22.844 --> 00:05:26.500
I mean. you already seem
so in touch with yourself.

126
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.591
Can't you do it on your own?
- I wish it was that simple.

127
00:05:30.591 --> 00:05:34.029
Um. true awakening requires
a deep examination of the self.

128
00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:36.510
And when you have baggage
like I do. it's just--

129
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.729
it can hold you back.

130
00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:40.905
What baggage?

131
00:05:40.905 --> 00:05:43.691
I just--I thought the whole
point of you going to Tibet

132
00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:46.476
was to deal with
things from your past.

133
00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:55.050
Just forget it.

134
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.009
Happy birthday.

135
00:06:02.492 --> 00:06:04.407
Sparkling cider

136
00:06:04.407 --> 00:06:06.061
for the hostess.
- Mm.

137
00:06:06.061 --> 00:06:07.715
Champagne
for the birthday boy.

138
00:06:07.715 --> 00:06:09.673
Thank you.

139
00:06:09.673 --> 00:06:11.588
Okay. everybody. ting. ting.
ting. ting. ting. ting. ting.

140
00:06:11.588 --> 00:06:13.851
Please. raise a glass
for the birthday boy.

141
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:15.636
- Oh.
- Happy birthday.

142
00:06:15.636 --> 00:06:17.377
- Cheers.
- Happy birthday.

143
00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:18.900
- Happy birthday. Barry.
- Speech.

144
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.424
all: Speech.
- Speech. speech. speech.

145
00:06:21.424 --> 00:06:23.470
I mean. what can
I say. except. um. I feel

146
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.863
really lucky to have
the best friends

147
00:06:25.863 --> 00:06:27.735
and family in the world.

148
00:06:27.735 --> 00:06:29.345
So here's to you guys.

149
00:06:29.345 --> 00:06:30.781
I love you all.

150
00:06:30.781 --> 00:06:32.827
Cheers.
- Cheers.

151
00:06:32.827 --> 00:06:33.915
Cheers.

152
00:06:37.832 --> 00:06:40.225
Chester. this cider
tastes a little expired.

153
00:06:40.225 --> 00:06:43.490
- It's not just the cider.
- I don't feel so good.

154
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.491
Yeah. me neither.

155
00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:50.758
Everybody stop drinking now.

156
00:06:50.758 --> 00:06:52.803
Iris. hey.

157
00:06:59.114 --> 00:07:01.421
Barry. what is happening?

158
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.814
<i>Quite the festivities.
Mr. Allen.</i>

159
00:07:03.814 --> 00:07:06.991
<i>My invitation must have
been lost in the mail.</i>

160
00:07:17.915 --> 00:07:20.483
I hope you don't mind me
crashing your party.

161
00:07:27.142 --> 00:07:29.449
Why all the sour faces?

162
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.581
Don't tell me I've
missed the cake.

163
00:07:34.497 --> 00:07:35.977
What did you do to them?

164
00:07:35.977 --> 00:07:38.153
Is this how you
greet an old friend.

165
00:07:38.153 --> 00:07:40.372
especially one that's
just escaped A.R.G.U.S.?

166
00:07:40.372 --> 00:07:42.505
You know. I came right
back here

167
00:07:42.505 --> 00:07:44.507
so we could pick up
where we left off.

168
00:07:44.507 --> 00:07:47.075
And now I find out you're
having a party without me.

169
00:07:47.075 --> 00:07:48.946
Look. I don't know you.

170
00:07:48.946 --> 00:07:51.514
but I know that we can solve
this without violence.

171
00:07:51.514 --> 00:07:53.864
Mr. West...

172
00:07:53.864 --> 00:07:55.344
I don't want violence.

173
00:07:55.344 --> 00:07:57.041
I simply wish to
save the world.

174
00:07:57.041 --> 00:07:58.652
You don't want
to save anyone.

175
00:07:58.652 --> 00:08:00.958
You're a monster
who wants to absorb us all

176
00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.786
into your sick mind.

177
00:08:02.786 --> 00:08:05.397
Is that such an unfair
price to pay for immortality?

178
00:08:05.397 --> 00:08:08.096
You hurt Iris. I will wipe
every last one of your cells

179
00:08:08.096 --> 00:08:09.227
off this planet.

180
00:08:09.227 --> 00:08:10.794
Fear not.

181
00:08:10.794 --> 00:08:12.535
Your wife is perfectly
safe and healthy.

182
00:08:12.535 --> 00:08:14.624
and she'll stay
that way forever.

183
00:08:14.624 --> 00:08:17.453
which means your daughter will
never know an orphan's grief.

184
00:08:17.453 --> 00:08:19.934
On the contrary.
little Nora West-Allen

185
00:08:19.934 --> 00:08:23.981
would be the first blood baby
born into a whole new world.

186
00:08:26.984 --> 00:08:29.291
Your anger means
nothing. Barry.

187
00:08:29.291 --> 00:08:31.859
Now. last time. I made you
into a blood brother first.

188
00:08:31.859 --> 00:08:34.688
only for your meddlesome team
to rise up against me.

189
00:08:34.688 --> 00:08:37.299
But this time. they
won't have that chance.

190
00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.563
And soon. your meager healing
factors will run out. too.

191
00:08:40.563 --> 00:08:42.609
I don't know
what you're up to.

192
00:08:42.609 --> 00:08:45.699
but you're not going to
get into my head again.

193
00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:48.049
But. Barry...

194
00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:52.793
I already am.

195
00:09:10.027 --> 00:09:12.813
Time to begin the good work.

196
00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.773
Someone didn't drink
their champagne.

197
00:09:18.079 --> 00:09:21.691
Uh. bro. I'm not really
much of a drinker.

198
00:09:21.691 --> 00:09:23.301
That's no fun.

199
00:09:23.301 --> 00:09:25.565
Now I'm going to have to
bring the party to you.

200
00:09:33.007 --> 00:09:34.835
Sweet Duane Jones.

201
00:09:37.446 --> 00:09:40.928
Oh. no. frak this.

202
00:09:45.106 --> 00:09:47.325
How fascinating.

203
00:09:47.325 --> 00:09:51.286
You're sharing your oxygen
with the embryo inside you.

204
00:09:51.286 --> 00:09:54.681
And she's sharing her
healing factors with you.

205
00:09:54.681 --> 00:09:57.335
- We're going to stop you.
- No. you won't.

206
00:09:57.335 --> 00:10:00.861
I've been playing
the long game. and you...

207
00:10:00.861 --> 00:10:02.906
have already lost.

208
00:10:05.822 --> 00:10:08.216
Ramsey!

209
00:10:08.216 --> 00:10:12.002
I know you can hear me!

210
00:10:12.002 --> 00:10:14.265
You can't fool me again.

211
00:10:14.265 --> 00:10:16.093
Those visions you
showed me last time.

212
00:10:16.093 --> 00:10:18.574
they were lies.
made to tempt me!

213
00:10:18.574 --> 00:10:21.882
I never lied to you. Barry.

214
00:10:21.882 --> 00:10:24.536
I just showed you
a future where you

215
00:10:24.536 --> 00:10:27.104
had the power to end death.

216
00:10:27.104 --> 00:10:29.803
But you rejected my offer.

217
00:10:29.803 --> 00:10:34.111
And now your friends
are dropping like flies.

218
00:10:34.111 --> 00:10:38.202
Nash. Caitlin. Frost--
it's quite the list.

219
00:10:38.202 --> 00:10:41.684
- You can't break me again.
- I don't need to. Barry.

220
00:10:41.684 --> 00:10:45.122
This time I have a more
interesting target in mind.

221
00:10:45.122 --> 00:10:49.910
just as fleet-footed. too.
only more perceptive.

222
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.781
Wally.

223
00:10:56.481 --> 00:10:59.006
Wally.

224
00:10:59.006 --> 00:11:00.355
Son.

225
00:11:00.355 --> 00:11:02.705
Wally?

226
00:11:02.705 --> 00:11:06.317
<i>Mama needs her medicine.</i>

227
00:11:09.494 --> 00:11:11.583
<i>Wally!</i>

228
00:11:11.583 --> 00:11:15.065
<i>Mama needs her medicine. Wally...</i>

229
00:11:15.065 --> 00:11:17.154
I'm sorry. Mr. West.

230
00:11:17.154 --> 00:11:19.635
I thought seeing your childhood
home would be comforting.

231
00:11:19.635 --> 00:11:23.378
but I suppose it is
rather spartan.

232
00:11:23.378 --> 00:11:26.511
especially compared to Barry's.

233
00:11:26.511 --> 00:11:28.470
Why'd you bring me here?

234
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.602
Because you need
a friend. Wallace.

235
00:11:30.602 --> 00:11:32.300
and because we
can help each other.

236
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.780
I'd never help you.

237
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.912
But you already have.

238
00:11:35.912 --> 00:11:38.349
You see. the last time
I encountered Team Flash.

239
00:11:38.349 --> 00:11:40.395
when I possessed Barry's mind.

240
00:11:40.395 --> 00:11:42.963
I learned what was coming--

241
00:11:42.963 --> 00:11:47.794
a crisis to end the Multiverse.

242
00:11:47.794 --> 00:11:49.970
But I guess it didn't take.

243
00:11:57.673 --> 00:11:59.327
No. you're wrong.

244
00:11:59.327 --> 00:12:02.025
The Multiverse is dead.

245
00:12:02.025 --> 00:12:04.506
I know because I lost Jesse.

246
00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.858
She's never coming back.

247
00:12:08.858 --> 00:12:10.468
Tell me something. Wallace.

248
00:12:10.468 --> 00:12:12.470
What did you see
out there when you

249
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.255
projected your consciousness--

250
00:12:14.255 --> 00:12:16.997
alternate timelines...

251
00:12:16.997 --> 00:12:19.608
or other Earths?

252
00:12:19.608 --> 00:12:22.002
Yes. Wallace. you
can sense them.

253
00:12:22.002 --> 00:12:24.613
So isn't it possible that
there's another Jesse Quick

254
00:12:24.613 --> 00:12:26.833
out there somewhere
just waiting

255
00:12:26.833 --> 00:12:29.313
for her Prince Charming
to come and find her?

256
00:12:30.662 --> 00:12:32.664
You're trying to trick me.

257
00:12:32.664 --> 00:12:35.319
but you can't tempt me
with simple desires.

258
00:12:35.319 --> 00:12:37.278
I know my truth.

259
00:12:37.278 --> 00:12:40.542
And why have you failed in
your quest for enlightenment?

260
00:12:40.542 --> 00:12:44.024
I know you've been wrestling
with the darkness inside you

261
00:12:44.024 --> 00:12:47.114
and how desperate you are
to rid yourself of it.

262
00:12:47.114 --> 00:12:50.639
But you can't. not on your own.

263
00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:52.119
Let me help you.

264
00:12:52.119 --> 00:12:54.730
How. by turning
me into a zombie?

265
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:59.039
No. by unlocking
your true potential.

266
00:13:01.171 --> 00:13:03.304
<i>This is your future.
Wally West.</i>

267
00:13:03.304 --> 00:13:05.828
You will enlighten
the entire world

268
00:13:05.828 --> 00:13:08.700
<i>and all the other worlds
yet to be discovered.</i>

269
00:13:13.227 --> 00:13:17.361
All you have to
do is choose life.

270
00:13:17.361 --> 00:13:20.843
No. y-you turned everybody
I loved into your slave.

271
00:13:20.843 --> 00:13:22.497
That's not choice.

272
00:13:22.497 --> 00:13:24.716
I understand your hesitation.

273
00:13:24.716 --> 00:13:27.850
No one has ever really
believed in you. have they?

274
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.418
You have been cut down
your entire life.

275
00:13:30.418 --> 00:13:34.117
forced to watch
your mother suffer.

276
00:13:34.117 --> 00:13:37.686
It is a pain
that I know all too well.

277
00:13:39.906 --> 00:13:42.909
My mother was
diagnosed with HLH.

278
00:13:42.909 --> 00:13:45.955
and I couldn't save
her either. Wally.

279
00:13:45.955 --> 00:13:48.871
I had to watch her die.

280
00:13:48.871 --> 00:13:50.960
And we have that in common.

281
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.616
Then you understand what
it is that I'm trying to do--

282
00:13:54.616 --> 00:13:56.400
that it's about more than
just stopping death.

283
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.272
It is about ending
the suffering

284
00:13:58.272 --> 00:14:02.015
that we have both endured.
that. together. we can create

285
00:14:02.015 --> 00:14:04.713
a Multiverse where no one
has to watch

286
00:14:04.713 --> 00:14:07.498
their loved ones die...

287
00:14:07.498 --> 00:14:09.239
ever again.

288
00:14:15.593 --> 00:14:18.727
Okay. okay. just me.

289
00:14:18.727 --> 00:14:21.034
Okay. all your
friends are zombies.

290
00:14:21.034 --> 00:14:23.514
But it's. uh--it's okay.
It's okay.

291
00:14:23.514 --> 00:14:26.430
You just got to call for help.

292
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.476
<i>Hello?
Is anyone there?</i>

293
00:14:28.476 --> 00:14:29.869
Iris?

294
00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:31.609
Oh. I thought you
were a zombie.

295
00:14:31.609 --> 00:14:33.785
<i>Little Nora's
healing factor--</i>

296
00:14:33.785 --> 00:14:36.788
<i>i-it's holding off
the infection for now.</i>

297
00:14:36.788 --> 00:14:38.790
<i>Look. I locked myself
in a time vault.</i>

298
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:42.794
<i>but someone cut the power
to the outside comms.</i>

299
00:14:42.794 --> 00:14:44.187
Iris?

300
00:14:44.187 --> 00:14:46.189
Iris. can you hear me?

301
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:48.539
I've been waiting
for you. Chuck.

302
00:14:48.539 --> 00:14:52.630
What. don't you want to give
your lover a kiss?

303
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:55.459
No. no. no. no.
You're not Allegra.

304
00:14:55.459 --> 00:14:58.245
You're Ramsey
controlling her body.

305
00:14:58.245 --> 00:15:01.030
And what
a powerful body it is.

306
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:02.858
Doing this to
people ain't a gift.

307
00:15:02.858 --> 00:15:05.643
What else would you
call eternal life?

308
00:15:05.643 --> 00:15:07.210
I'd call it hell on Earth.

309
00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.952
You know what?
I'll leave you alone.

310
00:15:16.002 --> 00:15:18.700
Unfortunately. the rest
of my brothers and sisters

311
00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.571
have different plans.

312
00:15:23.531 --> 00:15:25.576
Leave Wally alone.

313
00:15:25.576 --> 00:15:27.274
Don't worry.

314
00:15:27.274 --> 00:15:29.232
I have no intention
of harming him.

315
00:15:29.232 --> 00:15:32.105
But if I did. it
would be just one more

316
00:15:32.105 --> 00:15:34.237
sacrifice in your name. right?

317
00:15:34.237 --> 00:15:36.848
Sorry.

318
00:15:36.848 --> 00:15:41.331
Is it me. or is the lighting
in here a tad too melodramatic?

319
00:15:41.331 --> 00:15:44.595
Can I get a grip or an
electrician over here?

320
00:15:46.467 --> 00:15:49.209
What the hell?
Where are we?

321
00:15:49.209 --> 00:15:51.689
Language. Barry.
it's a family show.

322
00:15:51.689 --> 00:15:53.909
Now you'll have to keep up if
we're going to make our day.

323
00:15:53.909 --> 00:15:56.172
After all. you're
the star of the show.

324
00:16:03.658 --> 00:16:05.529
Wait. what's--
what's happening?

325
00:16:05.529 --> 00:16:07.662
- Okay. ready to try one?
- What is this?

326
00:16:07.662 --> 00:16:08.837
What are you doing?

327
00:16:08.837 --> 00:16:10.534
Making you look good. champ.

328
00:16:10.534 --> 00:16:13.146
All right. lock it up.

329
00:16:17.411 --> 00:16:20.109
Hey. man.
love your work.

330
00:16:20.109 --> 00:16:22.851
Roll sound.

331
00:16:25.245 --> 00:16:27.029
Mark.

332
00:16:27.029 --> 00:16:29.727
Ready. and action.

333
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.038
Um...

334
00:16:36.038 --> 00:16:38.214
Hi. kids.

335
00:16:38.214 --> 00:16:41.043
I'm the Flash.

336
00:16:41.043 --> 00:16:43.002
Did you know that
when a person survives

337
00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:46.048
an event that others didn't.

338
00:16:46.048 --> 00:16:48.268
it can lead to...

339
00:16:48.268 --> 00:16:49.747
feelings of guilt?

340
00:16:52.576 --> 00:16:54.361
That's a Flash fact.

341
00:16:56.841 --> 00:16:58.713
No. I'm not--
I'm not doing this.

342
00:16:58.713 --> 00:17:01.281
Cut.
That's a cut. everyone.

343
00:17:03.979 --> 00:17:05.198
Frost.

344
00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.985
It's okay that
she's dead. Barry.

345
00:17:12.553 --> 00:17:14.555
It's more important
that you live.

346
00:17:14.555 --> 00:17:15.991
You're the star. right?

347
00:17:15.991 --> 00:17:18.428
No.
No. that's not true.

348
00:17:18.428 --> 00:17:20.517
You matter more
than the rest of us.

349
00:17:20.517 --> 00:17:22.128
That's why it's okay

350
00:17:22.128 --> 00:17:24.130
that you got those
extra years and we didn't.

351
00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.697
I didn't want extra time.
not without all of you.

352
00:17:26.697 --> 00:17:28.830
Oh. that's lunch.

353
00:17:37.752 --> 00:17:40.929
Wally...

354
00:17:40.929 --> 00:17:43.192
are you okay?

355
00:17:43.192 --> 00:17:45.803
Young Wallace is
better than ever.

356
00:17:45.803 --> 00:17:50.330
He and I had a very
enlightening conversation.

357
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:53.072
Listen to me. Wally.

358
00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:56.988
Whatever Ramsey showed you.
it's not real.

359
00:17:56.988 --> 00:17:58.729
Shut up. Barry.

360
00:17:58.729 --> 00:17:59.861
Just shut up.

361
00:17:59.861 --> 00:18:02.646
This anger isn't you.

362
00:18:02.646 --> 00:18:06.346
Ramsey's manipulating you.
so you'll choose to follow him.

363
00:18:06.346 --> 00:18:08.826
It's the only way he can beat
our speed healing

364
00:18:08.826 --> 00:18:10.350
and take over our minds.

365
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.265
He doesn't care
about you. Wallace.

366
00:18:12.265 --> 00:18:15.703
He's been living with your
father. pawing at your sister.

367
00:18:15.703 --> 00:18:17.966
while you were trapped
in that hellhole.

368
00:18:17.966 --> 00:18:19.968
You were living my life.

369
00:18:19.968 --> 00:18:23.493
Wally. I know how hard
it was for you growing up.

370
00:18:23.493 --> 00:18:26.366
No. you don't!
You don't know anything!

371
00:18:26.366 --> 00:18:28.150
But Joe and Iris didn't
even know that you existed.

372
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.588
Keep his name out your mouth.
Joe West is my dad. mine.

373
00:18:31.588 --> 00:18:32.981
He's not yours.

374
00:18:32.981 --> 00:18:35.157
But you stole him
anyway from me.

375
00:18:35.157 --> 00:18:37.507
You got to have two
dads who loved you.

376
00:18:37.507 --> 00:18:39.074
I had nobody. Barry.

377
00:18:39.074 --> 00:18:42.077
You're so selfish.

378
00:18:42.077 --> 00:18:44.601
And you know why?

379
00:18:44.601 --> 00:18:48.431
Because you think that you're
the only person that matters.

380
00:18:48.431 --> 00:18:50.564
Wally...

381
00:18:50.564 --> 00:18:52.870
Joe loves you.

382
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.003
And I love you.

383
00:19:00.791 --> 00:19:03.185
Well. I hate you.

384
00:19:06.928 --> 00:19:08.495
Yes!

385
00:19:35.696 --> 00:19:39.656
Oh. Barry. Barry. Barry...

386
00:19:39.656 --> 00:19:41.658
what have you done this time?

387
00:19:51.407 --> 00:19:53.061
No.

388
00:19:55.803 --> 00:19:57.370
No. Ramsey's still
messing with my head.

389
00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:59.720
Barry. you need to calm down.

390
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.765
You're not real.

391
00:20:01.765 --> 00:20:03.463
How did I get here?

392
00:20:03.463 --> 00:20:06.074
Wally. he was a blood brother.
He attacked me.

393
00:20:10.513 --> 00:20:12.211
He killed me.

394
00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:14.952
Dying is the easy part.

395
00:20:14.952 --> 00:20:16.258
Remember?

396
00:20:18.347 --> 00:20:20.828
- It's really you.
- Yeah.

397
00:20:22.786 --> 00:20:25.572
Okay. Okay.

398
00:20:25.572 --> 00:20:26.921
Okay.

399
00:20:26.921 --> 00:20:28.749
Okay. let go.

400
00:20:28.749 --> 00:20:30.490
Barry. let go.

401
00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:33.319
Wait. If you're here.
that means I'm really--

402
00:20:33.319 --> 00:20:35.059
You're dead.

403
00:20:35.059 --> 00:20:37.497
Otherwise. why would
I let you hug me that long?

404
00:20:40.674 --> 00:20:43.894
But if I'm dead.
no one's there to stop them.

405
00:20:43.894 --> 00:20:47.289
Iris. the baby. the--
the whole world is in danger.

406
00:20:47.289 --> 00:20:48.943
I know.

407
00:20:48.943 --> 00:20:52.120
But it's not just your
world that's in danger.

408
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.297
When I took on the power
of the Spectre.

409
00:20:55.297 --> 00:20:58.474
I thought that I was simply
creating Earth-Prime.

410
00:20:58.474 --> 00:21:01.912
But I was also making
something else--

411
00:21:01.912 --> 00:21:04.654
a new Multiverse to replace
the one that had fallen.

412
00:21:06.961 --> 00:21:08.528
But when we fought
the Red Death.

413
00:21:08.528 --> 00:21:10.181
she thought she escaped
from her timeline

414
00:21:10.181 --> 00:21:12.880
into an alternate one.
- She is from Earth-4125.

415
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.316
You're numbering them?

416
00:21:14.316 --> 00:21:16.971
I've had a bit of time
on my hands--

417
00:21:16.971 --> 00:21:20.017
keeping an eye on threats
to these new worlds.

418
00:21:20.017 --> 00:21:23.107
like your friend Ramsey Rosso.

419
00:21:23.107 --> 00:21:24.935
He wants to spread
his infectious cells

420
00:21:24.935 --> 00:21:26.894
to every world out there.

421
00:21:26.894 --> 00:21:28.896
No. I mean.
Ramsey's powerful.

422
00:21:28.896 --> 00:21:30.985
but he's not capable
of something like that.

423
00:21:30.985 --> 00:21:34.205
Right. but
with Wally by his side...

424
00:21:34.205 --> 00:21:37.557
Wally thought that he was
projecting his consciousness

425
00:21:37.557 --> 00:21:40.560
into the Speed Force to reach
alternate timelines.

426
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.477
when. in fact. he was
reaching other Earths.

427
00:21:44.477 --> 00:21:47.567
So. if Ramsey's control

428
00:21:47.567 --> 00:21:50.483
over Wally becomes permanent...

429
00:21:50.483 --> 00:21:52.963
He'll gain control
over the Multiverse. too.

430
00:21:58.926 --> 00:22:01.972
Now. what have we here?

431
00:22:01.972 --> 00:22:06.150
Ah. a gift from the boy genius.

432
00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.414
You were so worried
about Allegra's protection.

433
00:22:08.414 --> 00:22:10.372
you didn't stop and think
about your own.

434
00:22:12.679 --> 00:22:14.028
Don't worry.

435
00:22:14.028 --> 00:22:15.682
In a few moments.
you won't care.

436
00:22:25.082 --> 00:22:26.693
Sounds like trouble.

437
00:22:26.693 --> 00:22:29.348
No.

438
00:22:29.348 --> 00:22:30.523
Khione?

439
00:22:37.443 --> 00:22:39.401
Whoa.

440
00:22:39.401 --> 00:22:42.926
What'd you. uh...
what'd you do to her?

441
00:22:42.926 --> 00:22:44.972
Same thing I did
to everyone else out there.

442
00:22:44.972 --> 00:22:47.061
I froze all the water
in her body.

443
00:22:47.061 --> 00:22:49.759
Oh. don't worry.
She's safe.

444
00:22:49.759 --> 00:22:51.761
Wait. How did you know
to find me here?

445
00:22:51.761 --> 00:22:53.763
I was in line
waiting for the cake

446
00:22:53.763 --> 00:22:57.027
when I felt
a presence calling me.

447
00:22:57.027 --> 00:23:00.074
telling me
that I was needed here.

448
00:23:00.074 --> 00:23:02.772
Only. now I get the feeling
the job isn't done.

449
00:23:12.478 --> 00:23:14.741
This world will
be cured soon.

450
00:23:14.741 --> 00:23:18.614
But there are so many
other worlds out there.

451
00:23:18.614 --> 00:23:20.573
I think it's time we started.

452
00:23:38.329 --> 00:23:40.680
Feel them...

453
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.249
millions of worlds
waiting for your life blood.

454
00:23:45.249 --> 00:23:48.122
A gateway to the Multiverse.

455
00:23:48.122 --> 00:23:50.124
Thank you. brother.

456
00:23:50.124 --> 00:23:54.955
Now infinite souls
will know my gift and rejoice.

457
00:24:14.104 --> 00:24:16.585
The attack's starting.

458
00:24:16.585 --> 00:24:18.544
Ramsey's fed his cells
into the breach.

459
00:24:18.544 --> 00:24:20.676
Soon. they are going
to infect your world

460
00:24:20.676 --> 00:24:22.678
and all of the worlds
yet to be born.

461
00:24:22.678 --> 00:24:25.855
I have to stop him.
You have to get me out of here.

462
00:24:25.855 --> 00:24:28.945
- It's not that simple.
- You have the power of a god.

463
00:24:28.945 --> 00:24:30.599
You can bring me
back from the dead.

464
00:24:30.599 --> 00:24:32.514
No. I can't...

465
00:24:32.514 --> 00:24:36.170
not while
there is a part of you

466
00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:39.347
that doesn't want to go back.

467
00:24:39.347 --> 00:24:41.741
That's not true.

468
00:24:41.741 --> 00:24:43.786
You've always been
a terrible liar.

469
00:24:49.966 --> 00:24:52.012
It's...

470
00:24:52.012 --> 00:24:55.755
it's my birthday today.

471
00:24:55.755 --> 00:24:57.017
I didn't want to do anything.

472
00:24:57.017 --> 00:24:59.410
but Iris threw
this party. and--

473
00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:03.719
I-I should have
been grateful. happy.

474
00:25:03.719 --> 00:25:05.939
But all I could think
about was...

475
00:25:07.984 --> 00:25:09.899
Everyone who couldn't be there.

476
00:25:09.899 --> 00:25:11.988
You've lost a lot
of people this year.

477
00:25:11.988 --> 00:25:14.643
Yeah. Frost died
fighting Deathstorm.

478
00:25:14.643 --> 00:25:16.906
Caitlin died
trying to save her.

479
00:25:16.906 --> 00:25:19.169
I fight some random
mad scientist.

480
00:25:19.169 --> 00:25:21.781
I get three extra
years to live.

481
00:25:21.781 --> 00:25:24.435
You know everything now.
right. Oliver?

482
00:25:24.435 --> 00:25:29.397
Tell me. how is it right
I'm alive and they're dead?

483
00:25:29.397 --> 00:25:30.703
How's that fair?

484
00:25:30.703 --> 00:25:33.401
Life is a lot
of things. Barry.

485
00:25:33.401 --> 00:25:35.011
Fair isn't on the list.

486
00:25:35.011 --> 00:25:37.579
You don't really
believe that.

487
00:25:37.579 --> 00:25:40.234
And if you did. your mom
wouldn't be alive again...

488
00:25:40.234 --> 00:25:42.018
or Tommy or Lance.

489
00:25:42.018 --> 00:25:46.153
You used your powers to bring
back everyone you loved.

490
00:25:46.153 --> 00:25:48.590
Not everyone.

491
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:49.939
Your dad.

492
00:25:49.939 --> 00:25:51.724
Survive.

493
00:25:51.724 --> 00:25:54.596
No!

494
00:25:54.596 --> 00:25:58.600
- Ollie. I'm sorry.
- It's--it's okay.

495
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.254
Bringing him back
would have done

496
00:26:00.254 --> 00:26:03.736
too much to alter reality.

497
00:26:03.736 --> 00:26:07.000
And I'd already done enough
to dishonor his sacrifice.

498
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.350
When my father
sacrificed himself.

499
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:12.440
when he gave me my extra years.

500
00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.748
what was I doing with them?

501
00:26:15.748 --> 00:26:17.532
I was wasting them.

502
00:26:17.532 --> 00:26:20.622
I was drowning myself
in this sea

503
00:26:20.622 --> 00:26:23.843
of--of pain and darkness

504
00:26:23.843 --> 00:26:25.845
and saying. Ollie.
if you just--

505
00:26:25.845 --> 00:26:29.805
if you cross one more
name off the list.

506
00:26:29.805 --> 00:26:34.114
if you save your
city one more time.

507
00:26:34.114 --> 00:26:36.986
then you'll absolve yourself
of all of this guilt.

508
00:26:36.986 --> 00:26:38.640
And I was wrong.

509
00:26:40.773 --> 00:26:43.514
This guilt is never
going to go away.

510
00:26:43.514 --> 00:26:46.692
It is something that you
have to learn to live with.

511
00:26:46.692 --> 00:26:49.564
That is why people
sacrificed themselves.

512
00:26:49.564 --> 00:26:52.741
That is why I sacrificed
myself for you.

513
00:26:52.741 --> 00:26:56.658
so that in all
of this darkness...

514
00:26:56.658 --> 00:26:58.268
you...

515
00:27:00.314 --> 00:27:02.490
Could be a guiding light...

516
00:27:05.667 --> 00:27:08.104
A hero.

517
00:27:08.104 --> 00:27:09.802
Because heroes
don't stop running.

518
00:27:09.802 --> 00:27:11.281
You're damn right.

519
00:27:11.281 --> 00:27:14.328
So...

520
00:27:14.328 --> 00:27:16.591
are you ready
to keep running?

521
00:27:19.246 --> 00:27:22.423
Good.

522
00:27:22.423 --> 00:27:24.512
Wait. hang on.
You're not going to...

523
00:27:24.512 --> 00:27:26.035
boop me again. are you?

524
00:27:26.035 --> 00:27:28.342
It kind of killed
the Speed Force last time.

525
00:27:28.342 --> 00:27:31.606
No. no. I'm not gonna--
not gonna boop you.

526
00:27:33.564 --> 00:27:35.175
Ow!

527
00:27:35.175 --> 00:27:37.960
That hurts.
- Living hurts.

528
00:27:41.398 --> 00:27:42.661
Add it to the list.

529
00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:44.750
Wait.
You came back. too.

530
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:46.490
It's just temporary.

531
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:49.015
I can only intervene when
the Multiverse is in danger.

532
00:27:49.015 --> 00:27:50.799
I think you missed me.

533
00:27:55.151 --> 00:27:59.852
Not as much as I missed this.

534
00:28:02.028 --> 00:28:03.943
Let's go kick some ass.

535
00:28:14.823 --> 00:28:16.825
Ramsey's cells
are metastasizing

536
00:28:16.825 --> 00:28:18.218
inside that breach.

537
00:28:18.218 --> 00:28:19.654
If we're going
to wipe them out.

538
00:28:19.654 --> 00:28:21.569
we need a massive
ultraviolet pulse.

539
00:28:28.619 --> 00:28:31.753
How'd he do that?
I thought you were the Spectre.

540
00:28:31.753 --> 00:28:35.017
The attack on the Multiverse
is weakening my powers.

541
00:28:35.017 --> 00:28:37.933
I need a clear
shot at the breach.

542
00:28:37.933 --> 00:28:41.241
The Flash and Green Arrow
together again?

543
00:28:41.241 --> 00:28:43.765
I am honored.
- Don't be.

544
00:28:43.765 --> 00:28:46.507
Wally. you don't
have to do this.

545
00:28:46.507 --> 00:28:48.074
Too late. Flash.

546
00:28:48.074 --> 00:28:50.772
Wallace worships
a new faith now.

547
00:28:50.772 --> 00:28:54.210
He worships
at the altar of Bloodwork.

548
00:28:58.214 --> 00:29:02.610
You are starting
to piss me off.

549
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:04.568
Why?

550
00:29:04.568 --> 00:29:07.093
I'm only trying to improve your
Multiverse by ending death.

551
00:29:07.093 --> 00:29:09.748
Then I can bring
every world together

552
00:29:09.748 --> 00:29:11.793
under one mind
for singular purpose--

553
00:29:11.793 --> 00:29:13.708
immortality.

554
00:29:13.708 --> 00:29:17.016
Those worlds
don't belong to you.

555
00:29:17.016 --> 00:29:18.800
You're right.

556
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.976
They belong to them.

557
00:30:22.168 --> 00:30:25.649
Are you. uh--are you sure
this is going to work?

558
00:30:25.649 --> 00:30:27.086
Trust me.

559
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:38.401
That's all I can manage.

560
00:30:38.401 --> 00:30:41.056
Oh! Aah!

561
00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.628
Mm.

562
00:30:50.022 --> 00:30:52.589
What the hell?

563
00:30:52.589 --> 00:30:55.288
Did that come out of me?

564
00:30:55.288 --> 00:30:58.204
Where's Barry?
- He needs your help.

565
00:31:30.932 --> 00:31:32.978
I'm not going to
fight you. Wally.

566
00:31:32.978 --> 00:31:35.371
Wallace is gone.

567
00:31:35.371 --> 00:31:37.721
I know you can hear me.

568
00:31:37.721 --> 00:31:41.160
I need you to know I'm sorry.

569
00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.118
not just for today.

570
00:31:43.118 --> 00:31:45.773
for all the times I've made you
feel like you didn't matter.

571
00:31:47.427 --> 00:31:51.300
Everyone has
darkness inside them.

572
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:54.738
There is no cure for that pain.
We can only accept it.

573
00:31:54.738 --> 00:31:56.915
That's the only
way we can beat it.

574
00:31:56.915 --> 00:32:00.092
You can do this. Wally.
You can beat him.

575
00:32:00.092 --> 00:32:02.964
I know you can!
- No!

576
00:32:06.359 --> 00:32:08.448
Brother/sister
crime-fighting unit.

577
00:32:08.448 --> 00:32:10.711
No.

578
00:32:10.711 --> 00:32:13.061
No!

579
00:32:22.288 --> 00:32:24.638
I killed you.
I'm sorry.

580
00:32:24.638 --> 00:32:26.205
I came back.

581
00:32:28.685 --> 00:32:31.601
Now let's go save
the Multiverse.

582
00:32:42.177 --> 00:32:44.832
Impressive...

583
00:32:44.832 --> 00:32:47.443
but let's see
how you fare against me.

584
00:32:58.889 --> 00:33:00.239
Oliver.

585
00:33:00.239 --> 00:33:03.024
I can explain.

586
00:33:03.024 --> 00:33:05.070
It doesn't matter. man.

587
00:33:10.466 --> 00:33:12.468
How touching.

588
00:33:12.468 --> 00:33:15.471
Unfortunately. this reunion
will be short-lived.

589
00:33:18.692 --> 00:33:20.389
That's one ugly
son of a bitch.

590
00:33:45.936 --> 00:33:48.374
Oliver. we got you
a clear shot.

591
00:33:52.291 --> 00:33:54.293
Ramsey Rosso!

592
00:33:54.293 --> 00:33:57.296
You have failed this city!

593
00:34:22.799 --> 00:34:26.107
+- I feel like I just recovered

594
00:34:26.107 --> 00:34:28.718
from the world's
worst hangover.

595
00:34:28.718 --> 00:34:30.503
I think we all did.

596
00:34:30.503 --> 00:34:32.548
The last thing I remember
is drinking champagne.

597
00:34:32.548 --> 00:34:33.941
What happened?

598
00:34:33.941 --> 00:34:36.074
Ramsey's having
a very bad day.

599
00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:39.120
Hey. what about Allegra?

600
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.035
Chuck.

601
00:34:55.876 --> 00:34:58.139
What have you done to me?

602
00:34:58.139 --> 00:34:59.836
I'm human again.

603
00:34:59.836 --> 00:35:01.795
I've cleansed
the entire Multiverse

604
00:35:01.795 --> 00:35:03.144
of your infectious cells.

605
00:35:03.144 --> 00:35:04.885
including the ones
inside you.

606
00:35:04.885 --> 00:35:06.669
And you killed me.

607
00:35:06.669 --> 00:35:08.628
Now my HLH will return.

608
00:35:08.628 --> 00:35:12.022
I took care of that. too--
perks of being the Spectre.

609
00:35:12.022 --> 00:35:13.763
So it looks like
you'll be spending

610
00:35:13.763 --> 00:35:16.244
the rest of your human days
as a regular criminal.

611
00:35:16.244 --> 00:35:18.507
Where you're going
to rot until old age.

612
00:35:18.507 --> 00:35:20.466
just like everyone else.

613
00:35:20.466 --> 00:35:22.555
No.

614
00:35:22.555 --> 00:35:25.819
I was going to cure death.

615
00:35:25.819 --> 00:35:27.995
I was supposed
to save the world.

616
00:35:27.995 --> 00:35:31.259
Don't worry.
That's our job.

617
00:35:38.571 --> 00:35:40.181
Thank you so much
for protecting my family.

618
00:35:40.181 --> 00:35:41.617
I don't know how much longer

619
00:35:41.617 --> 00:35:44.054
little Nora and I could have
held out.

620
00:35:44.054 --> 00:35:45.578
Well. you're welcome.

621
00:35:45.578 --> 00:35:48.755
I still can't believe
that you're here.

622
00:35:48.755 --> 00:35:50.104
I'm only allowed to intervene

623
00:35:50.104 --> 00:35:52.280
when the Multiverse
is in danger.

624
00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.021
And now that Barry's
taking Ramsey Rosso

625
00:35:54.021 --> 00:35:55.414
back to A.R.G.U.S..

626
00:35:55.414 --> 00:35:57.242
it's safe to say
everyone's out of danger.

627
00:35:57.242 --> 00:36:00.027
So the Multiverse
exists again?

628
00:36:00.027 --> 00:36:01.681
It's a miracle.

629
00:36:01.681 --> 00:36:03.030
Uh. isn't it science?

630
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:05.032
I think it's
a little of both.

631
00:36:05.032 --> 00:36:08.078
I understand.

632
00:36:08.078 --> 00:36:09.558
It was you.

633
00:36:09.558 --> 00:36:11.430
You're the presence
that told me

634
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:14.433
to go back to S.T.A.R. Labs
so that I could save Diggle.

635
00:36:14.433 --> 00:36:16.435
Khione. you're connected
to the natural world.

636
00:36:16.435 --> 00:36:18.524
so you were able to use
your powers to expel

637
00:36:18.524 --> 00:36:21.353
the unnatural inside of John.

638
00:36:21.353 --> 00:36:23.485
That's a lot to digest.

639
00:36:23.485 --> 00:36:25.922
I'm going to go meditate.

640
00:36:25.922 --> 00:36:28.360
Okay.

641
00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.058
So now what?

642
00:36:31.058 --> 00:36:32.712
Um...

643
00:36:32.712 --> 00:36:34.931
wasn't there a party happening?

644
00:36:39.414 --> 00:36:40.981
Cheers.

645
00:36:44.941 --> 00:36:46.378
<i>You okay?</i>

646
00:36:48.554 --> 00:36:51.470
Honestly. I have no idea.

647
00:36:55.082 --> 00:36:57.693
Barry told me
what Ramsey showed you--

648
00:36:57.693 --> 00:36:59.956
your room at Mom's house.

649
00:36:59.956 --> 00:37:02.872
I can't imagine
how painful that was.

650
00:37:02.872 --> 00:37:05.135
Yeah. well...

651
00:37:05.135 --> 00:37:07.703
I know I'm not going to find
an answer to that pain

652
00:37:07.703 --> 00:37:09.879
in the Multiverse.

653
00:37:09.879 --> 00:37:12.055
I have to look within.

654
00:37:12.055 --> 00:37:14.057
Sometimes it just...

655
00:37:14.057 --> 00:37:16.495
feels impossible.

656
00:37:16.495 --> 00:37:19.759
To cease from evil.
to do good.

657
00:37:19.759 --> 00:37:22.240
and to purify
the mind yourself--

658
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.590
that is the teaching
of all Buddhas.

659
00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:26.809
What? I read your long-ass
emails you'd send me.

660
00:37:29.769 --> 00:37:32.772
Thank you.
Thanks for everything.

661
00:37:32.772 --> 00:37:35.209
You're going to be
the best mom.

662
00:37:35.209 --> 00:37:37.646
And you're gonna be
the best uncle.

663
00:37:37.646 --> 00:37:39.300
Mm. come here.

664
00:37:44.523 --> 00:37:45.524
Guys...

665
00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:50.572
Mmm!

666
00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.751
Lyla wants me back
at A.R.G.U.S. to debrief her

667
00:37:55.751 --> 00:37:58.363
on the festivities.

668
00:37:58.363 --> 00:38:00.713
- Duty calls.
- Hmm.

669
00:38:03.672 --> 00:38:05.718
So...

670
00:38:05.718 --> 00:38:07.937
are you going to get
to see her this time?

671
00:38:07.937 --> 00:38:10.549
Um...

672
00:38:10.549 --> 00:38:12.333
My...

673
00:38:12.333 --> 00:38:15.771
powers came with rules.

674
00:38:15.771 --> 00:38:18.774
Me and Felicity...

675
00:38:18.774 --> 00:38:21.124
our destiny has been written.

676
00:38:21.124 --> 00:38:23.953
You sure would be proud
of her. Ollie. the kids. too.

677
00:38:23.953 --> 00:38:26.042
William--he's in college.

678
00:38:26.042 --> 00:38:27.957
Mia...

679
00:38:27.957 --> 00:38:30.873
Mia can climb a salmon ladder.
man. with the best of them.

680
00:38:30.873 --> 00:38:33.006
I know. I know.

681
00:38:33.006 --> 00:38:35.182
I've been keeping
an eye on them...

682
00:38:35.182 --> 00:38:36.575
Yeah.

683
00:38:36.575 --> 00:38:38.228
And on you.

684
00:38:42.624 --> 00:38:46.411
John. that cube
was designed to tempt you.

685
00:38:48.195 --> 00:38:51.241
But you did the right thing.

686
00:38:51.241 --> 00:38:55.376
And now all of your brightest
days are ahead of you

687
00:38:55.376 --> 00:38:58.074
because they'll be spent
with your family.

688
00:38:58.074 --> 00:39:01.251
You're my family. Oliver.

689
00:39:01.251 --> 00:39:04.472
I'm just glad I get to say
goodbye to you this time.

690
00:39:05.995 --> 00:39:07.736
Me too.

691
00:39:07.736 --> 00:39:09.172
I love you. John.

692
00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:13.002
Love you. too. brother.

693
00:39:19.661 --> 00:39:22.055
<i>So you got to tell me
about these other Earths.</i>

694
00:39:22.055 --> 00:39:25.014
I mean. how many other
Flashes are there?

695
00:39:25.014 --> 00:39:28.583
Uh...

696
00:39:28.583 --> 00:39:31.194
More than enough. but...

697
00:39:31.194 --> 00:39:35.634
I got to say. nobody is
more impressive than you.

698
00:39:35.634 --> 00:39:38.854
How many times have you
saved your city now--170?

699
00:39:38.854 --> 00:39:41.422
180. actually.

700
00:39:43.119 --> 00:39:44.425
It's all because of you.

701
00:39:44.425 --> 00:39:46.296
I mean. you started this.
- Well...

702
00:39:46.296 --> 00:39:48.298
I don't know what my life
would have been like

703
00:39:48.298 --> 00:39:50.866
if I hadn't taken that train
to Star City.

704
00:39:50.866 --> 00:39:53.391
You still would
have been a hero.

705
00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:55.523
Maybe.

706
00:39:55.523 --> 00:39:58.744
But you made me a better one.

707
00:39:58.744 --> 00:40:00.833
You made me a better man.

708
00:40:00.833 --> 00:40:04.445
<i>Prochnost.</i>

709
00:40:04.445 --> 00:40:06.708
- Very--very good.
- Okay.

710
00:40:08.754 --> 00:40:11.670
Okay. Mr. Allen. I think
that I have done enough

711
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:15.500
to upset the cosmic
order for one night.

712
00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.502
Can you get this?

713
00:40:17.502 --> 00:40:20.287
Are you kidding?
You're a billionaire.

714
00:40:20.287 --> 00:40:22.028
Well. you...

715
00:40:22.028 --> 00:40:23.986
you can't take it with you.

716
00:40:25.423 --> 00:40:26.902
Oliver.

717
00:40:26.902 --> 00:40:28.687
Yeah.

718
00:40:28.687 --> 00:40:32.734
I mean. you can see
everything. right?

719
00:40:32.734 --> 00:40:34.693
Mm-hmm.

720
00:40:34.693 --> 00:40:39.132
Do you think I'm--
I'm doing enough...

721
00:40:39.132 --> 00:40:43.963
with my powers.
with my time here?

722
00:40:43.963 --> 00:40:46.139
Well. Barry. you tell me.

723
00:40:49.621 --> 00:40:53.146
Do you give people hope?

724
00:40:53.146 --> 00:40:56.976
Are you moving through your
city like a...

725
00:40:56.976 --> 00:40:58.891
guardian angel?

726
00:41:00.936 --> 00:41:02.460
Do you make a difference?

727
00:41:07.726 --> 00:41:11.991
That bolt of lightning
chose you.

728
00:41:11.991 --> 00:41:14.950
Don't ever forget it.

729
00:41:17.562 --> 00:41:21.740
Oh. and...

730
00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:23.742
happy birthday.

731
00:41:38.583 --> 00:41:39.932
Thanks.

732
00:42:15.228 --> 00:42:16.751
<i>Greg. move your head.</i>
