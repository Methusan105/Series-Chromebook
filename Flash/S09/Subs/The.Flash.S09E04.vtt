1
00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:42.216
How long until it's finished?

2
00:00:42.216 --> 00:00:44.348
It's gonna take a lot longer

3
00:00:44.348 --> 00:00:47.003
than it would otherwise
if you keep interrupting me.

4
00:00:52.487 --> 00:00:54.967
How long?

5
00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:57.753
Or is getting your girlfriend
back not important anymore?

6
00:00:57.753 --> 00:00:59.929
I don't know.
Another hour?

7
00:01:03.715 --> 00:01:05.761
This machine...

8
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:08.459
I don't know what you want
it for. and I don't care.

9
00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:10.113
It's none of my business.

10
00:01:10.113 --> 00:01:13.160
But...

11
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.727
Sure would be helpful to know
how you expect me to power it.

12
00:01:15.727 --> 00:01:18.556
- Leave the power source to me.
- Okay.

13
00:01:18.556 --> 00:01:20.341
You do realize this thing
takes enough juice

14
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:22.125
to light up
the whole Eastern Seaboard?

15
00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:24.867
Are you doubting me?

16
00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:26.216
I'm not surprised.

17
00:01:26.216 --> 00:01:27.826
You're all the same.
aren't you?

18
00:01:27.826 --> 00:01:30.612
Criminals...

19
00:01:30.612 --> 00:01:33.093
a superstitious
and cowardly lot.

20
00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:36.792
quivering like mice
in their little holes.

21
00:01:36.792 --> 00:01:38.750
easy prey for the bad.

22
00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:44.974
Now let me go enlist

23
00:01:44.974 --> 00:01:47.281
another mouse to our cause.

24
00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:19.965
So we don't know who
the Rogues' new partner is

25
00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:22.316
or what they would need
the cosmic treadmill for.

26
00:02:22.316 --> 00:02:25.841
but we do know
that he's a speedster.

27
00:02:25.841 --> 00:02:29.192
And he's the new Avatar
for the Negative Speed Force.

28
00:02:30.715 --> 00:02:34.023
So. if this new
speedster is the Avatar...

29
00:02:35.894 --> 00:02:38.723
Won't he try to kill you?

30
00:02:38.723 --> 00:02:41.030
I'm not so sure.

31
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.730
I mean. back at Fort L.U.K.I.A.
when he had disabled my powers.

32
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.732
he could have killed me
right on the spot.

33
00:02:47.732 --> 00:02:49.038
but he didn't.

34
00:02:49.038 --> 00:02:50.605
Why not?

35
00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:53.956
Maybe he doesn't want to be
the Avatar.

36
00:02:53.956 --> 00:02:57.916
Maybe he's just been corrupted
by negative speed.

37
00:02:57.916 --> 00:02:59.831
Like Meena Dhawan.

38
00:03:02.704 --> 00:03:06.186
Uh. whatever
this new Avatar is doing

39
00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.666
with the treadmill.

40
00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:12.540
it'll upset the balance between
the forces all over again.

41
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.064
If there's even
the slightest chance

42
00:03:15.064 --> 00:03:17.240
I can pull them back
from the brink...

43
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.503
It's not supposed
to end like this.

44
00:03:22.854 --> 00:03:26.641
Barry. Thawne
got himself killed.

45
00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:29.470
You didn't cause that.
- I know.

46
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.299
But I won't let anyone
go down that same path.

47
00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.650
not if I can help it.

48
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.000
I-I need to go
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

49
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.002
Chester and I are gonna reset
the satellites

50
00:03:40.002 --> 00:03:41.786
to scan for the Avatar.
- Okay.

51
00:03:41.786 --> 00:03:43.614
I'm gonna stay here.

52
00:03:43.614 --> 00:03:46.617
Luke Fox just sent me the
GPS coordinates I asked for--

53
00:03:46.617 --> 00:03:48.445
Ryan Wilder's
last known location

54
00:03:48.445 --> 00:03:50.055
the day that she disappeared.

55
00:03:50.055 --> 00:03:52.057
She's the CEO
of Wayne Enterprises.

56
00:03:52.057 --> 00:03:55.713
and now this new Avatar
is handing out Wayne Tech?

57
00:03:55.713 --> 00:03:57.454
That's not a coincidence.

58
00:03:57.454 --> 00:03:59.413
Ryan's lucky to have
you in her corner.

59
00:03:59.413 --> 00:04:00.979
Thanks.
Be safe out there.

60
00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:02.938
I will.

61
00:04:02.938 --> 00:04:04.896
Promise.

62
00:04:10.641 --> 00:04:14.079
The night before
the Red Panda's second game.

63
00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.344
Peyton has a dream that
he is a soccer superhero.

64
00:04:17.344 --> 00:04:18.823
- Hi.
- Hey.

65
00:04:18.823 --> 00:04:20.869
I'm so sorry.

66
00:04:20.869 --> 00:04:22.044
Training ran late.

67
00:04:22.044 --> 00:04:24.351
- Mommy!
- Hi. nugget.

68
00:04:24.351 --> 00:04:27.484
Jenna Marie West.

69
00:04:27.484 --> 00:04:29.878
did you get taller
while I was gone?

70
00:04:29.878 --> 00:04:31.445
You're not supposed to do that!

71
00:04:31.445 --> 00:04:33.882
All growing happens
when Mommy's at home!

72
00:04:33.882 --> 00:04:37.277
- Leftovers in the fridge.
- Thank you.

73
00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.843
I'm starving.

74
00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:46.721
Hey.

75
00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:48.679
What's this?

76
00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:50.942
Little one.
take this upstairs.

77
00:04:50.942 --> 00:04:52.857
I'll be right there. okay?

78
00:04:55.686 --> 00:04:57.949
Uh. look...

79
00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.910
you know how I've been thinking
about us leaving the city?

80
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.694
Because you were
worried about me

81
00:05:03.694 --> 00:05:05.435
being out on the front lines.

82
00:05:05.435 --> 00:05:07.698
But we said that we would talk
about that together.

83
00:05:07.698 --> 00:05:10.484
But you're--what. you're--
you're talking to a realtor?

84
00:05:10.484 --> 00:05:13.313
I know.
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:16.925
But I saw that house.
and it's perfect for us.

86
00:05:16.925 --> 00:05:18.927
It's in a highly rated
school district.

87
00:05:18.927 --> 00:05:21.103
It has a huge backyard
for Jenna to play in.

88
00:05:21.103 --> 00:05:23.148
Joe. it's a two-hour commute
from Central City.

89
00:05:23.148 --> 00:05:25.325
Did you think about my job?
I have a law practice.

90
00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.631
It has an extra room
that's perfect

91
00:05:27.631 --> 00:05:29.329
for a home office.

92
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.156
I think we should take
a look at it.

93
00:05:31.156 --> 00:05:32.723
It won't be on the market
for long.

94
00:05:32.723 --> 00:05:34.508
I'm not looking
at any houses.

95
00:05:34.508 --> 00:05:37.641
not until we've thought
about what a move like this

96
00:05:37.641 --> 00:05:39.904
would even mean...

97
00:05:39.904 --> 00:05:41.732
for the both of us.

98
00:05:43.908 --> 00:05:44.909
You're right.

99
00:05:49.174 --> 00:05:51.002
I'm just gonna get her
tucked in.

100
00:06:05.234 --> 00:06:06.627
Uh...

101
00:06:15.113 --> 00:06:18.203
I though the timing
was right now.

102
00:06:18.203 --> 00:06:20.815
Okay. Gideon's picked up
the tachyon signature

103
00:06:20.815 --> 00:06:22.773
we pulled off my suit
after the Avatar attack.

104
00:06:22.773 --> 00:06:24.645
Okay.
Let's do this thing.

105
00:06:43.141 --> 00:06:46.667
Come and get me. Flash.

106
00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:50.018
Ah. there he is.

107
00:06:50.018 --> 00:06:52.020
Here to save the day?

108
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.848
I'm here to talk.

109
00:06:53.848 --> 00:06:57.068
By all means. please.

110
00:06:58.766 --> 00:07:01.159
I know what you're doing.

111
00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:04.162
You're trying to build
a cosmic treadmill.

112
00:07:04.162 --> 00:07:06.469
But if you tell me
why you're doing this.

113
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:10.952
where your powers come from.
maybe I can help.

114
00:07:10.952 --> 00:07:14.477
and we can solve everything
without more fighting.

115
00:07:14.477 --> 00:07:17.480
I just need to know
what it is you want

116
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.700
and who you really are.

117
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.224
You want to know who I am?

118
00:07:22.224 --> 00:07:24.835
I'm the last glimmer of crimson

119
00:07:24.835 --> 00:07:29.884
a killer sees before he draws
his final breath.

120
00:07:29.884 --> 00:07:32.930
I am vengeance.

121
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.238
I am the night.

122
00:07:36.238 --> 00:07:39.633
I am the Red Death.

123
00:07:43.114 --> 00:07:45.813
Bivolo?

124
00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:51.383
What's the matter. Flash?

125
00:07:51.383 --> 00:07:53.473
You seem...

126
00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:54.822
terrified.

127
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.137
Too easy.

128
00:08:06.137 --> 00:08:10.272
And now. let there be darkness.

129
00:08:21.326 --> 00:08:22.458
What the hell?

130
00:08:26.288 --> 00:08:27.681
What in the world?

131
00:08:31.293 --> 00:08:32.860
Flash. can you hear me?

132
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:33.991
<i>Flash?</i>

133
00:08:33.991 --> 00:08:39.127
Now the real work begins.

134
00:08:49.006 --> 00:08:51.182
Wakey. wakey.

135
00:08:56.753 --> 00:08:59.277
Where am I?
- You're in hell.

136
00:08:59.277 --> 00:09:01.628
So don't even bother
trying to run.

137
00:09:01.628 --> 00:09:03.891
Bivolo.

138
00:09:03.891 --> 00:09:06.807
You were in it for the money.
Why join up with killers?

139
00:09:06.807 --> 00:09:08.765
You let me rot
in that Pipeline of yours

140
00:09:08.765 --> 00:09:10.680
for nine months.

141
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.597
I've been waiting to get even
a long time.

142
00:09:14.597 --> 00:09:17.818
Now. what should we do
with you?

143
00:09:20.908 --> 00:09:22.344
Okay. whoa. whoa.

144
00:09:22.344 --> 00:09:24.825
Better--
you know. better idea.

145
00:09:24.825 --> 00:09:28.263
Why don't we see
who's behind the mask?

146
00:09:29.612 --> 00:09:32.136
I wouldn't do that...

147
00:09:32.136 --> 00:09:33.616
if I were you...

148
00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:37.577
That is. unless what you want

149
00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:39.491
is to get pumped full
of 50.000 volts

150
00:09:39.491 --> 00:09:41.624
from the booby trap
in his cowl.

151
00:09:43.713 --> 00:09:46.237
Chillblaine...

152
00:09:46.237 --> 00:09:49.371
what are you still doing
with these guys?

153
00:09:49.371 --> 00:09:51.939
My job.

154
00:09:51.939 --> 00:09:53.810
No.

155
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.290
You're gonna build

156
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:56.857
the Red Death's
cosmic treadmill for him?

157
00:09:56.857 --> 00:09:58.293
Him?

158
00:09:58.293 --> 00:10:02.253
Somebody needs to catch up.

159
00:10:02.253 --> 00:10:04.647
That machine
can tap into forces

160
00:10:04.647 --> 00:10:06.823
beyond anyone's control.

161
00:10:06.823 --> 00:10:08.608
If she uses it.

162
00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:11.001
it could damage
the whole timeline.

163
00:10:11.001 --> 00:10:14.222
destroy countless lives.

164
00:10:14.222 --> 00:10:17.312
What a pity that would be.

165
00:10:17.312 --> 00:10:19.836
Blaine. get back to work.

166
00:10:19.836 --> 00:10:22.709
The rest of you.
guard the entrances.

167
00:10:22.709 --> 00:10:25.537
The blackout should keep
the police busy.

168
00:10:25.537 --> 00:10:28.236
but it won't be long
before his foolish teammates

169
00:10:28.236 --> 00:10:30.325
attempt a rescue mission.

170
00:10:33.981 --> 00:10:37.114
You said you wanted
to talk. Flash.

171
00:10:37.114 --> 00:10:39.377
So let's talk.

172
00:10:43.947 --> 00:10:45.906
Damn it.
Comms are still down.

173
00:10:45.906 --> 00:10:48.038
and I can't get a hold of Iris
or Joe and Cecile.

174
00:10:48.038 --> 00:10:49.866
They'll be okay.
Cecile is strong.

175
00:10:49.866 --> 00:10:51.825
She can protect them.

176
00:10:51.825 --> 00:10:54.741
Sweet Otis Boykin.

177
00:10:54.741 --> 00:10:57.395
That was one of the strongest
electromagnetic pulses

178
00:10:57.395 --> 00:11:00.268
ever recorded
outside of a nuclear event.

179
00:11:00.268 --> 00:11:01.661
Even with
our backup generators.

180
00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:03.445
we're only operating
at 20% power.

181
00:11:03.445 --> 00:11:05.099
nowhere close enough

182
00:11:05.099 --> 00:11:07.188
to re-establishing
a link with our satellites.

183
00:11:07.188 --> 00:11:08.842
So we have no way
of finding Barry?

184
00:11:08.842 --> 00:11:11.105
All we know is.
last time we had contact.

185
00:11:11.105 --> 00:11:13.673
he was with Red Death
and Bivolo.

186
00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:16.545
If he's not here by now. they
probably took him somewhere.

187
00:11:16.545 --> 00:11:18.286
In a lightning storm.

188
00:11:18.286 --> 00:11:20.984
hot air and cold air
come together.

189
00:11:20.984 --> 00:11:23.595
When the liquid droplets
and the ice crystals collide.

190
00:11:23.595 --> 00:11:25.902
they become
static electricity.

191
00:11:25.902 --> 00:11:29.079
something they
never could have been before.

192
00:11:29.079 --> 00:11:31.734
Okay. W--what does that
have to do with us?

193
00:11:31.734 --> 00:11:34.302
We need to collide
with our opposites

194
00:11:34.302 --> 00:11:36.217
to solve our problem.

195
00:11:36.217 --> 00:11:40.134
Wait. are you saying we need
to call Barry's Rogue Squad?

196
00:11:40.134 --> 00:11:42.527
I could use our CB radio

197
00:11:42.527 --> 00:11:46.357
to send out a distress call
at 160 hertz.

198
00:11:46.357 --> 00:11:48.533
Hartley uses that frequency
with his crew.

199
00:11:48.533 --> 00:11:50.579
Sounds like a long shot.

200
00:11:50.579 --> 00:11:52.015
Maybe.

201
00:11:52.015 --> 00:11:54.278
But right now.
this is all we got.

202
00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.501
What a sight...

203
00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:03.157
the so-called
fastest man alive...

204
00:12:04.158 --> 00:12:05.986
Helpless...

205
00:12:05.986 --> 00:12:07.727
chained...

206
00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:11.121
powerless.

207
00:12:11.121 --> 00:12:13.776
I don't know who you are...

208
00:12:13.776 --> 00:12:17.475
but I know how much hate
you must feel for me.

209
00:12:17.475 --> 00:12:19.347
But it isn't yours.

210
00:12:19.347 --> 00:12:22.002
It's the Negative Speed Force
influencing you.

211
00:12:22.002 --> 00:12:25.527
It feeds off your rage
and anger.

212
00:12:25.527 --> 00:12:27.224
Now it's corrupted your mind.

213
00:12:27.224 --> 00:12:30.619
And you think I can be saved?

214
00:12:30.619 --> 00:12:32.273
I've seen it happen before.

215
00:12:32.273 --> 00:12:34.754
The power that's inside you--

216
00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:36.320
it's strong.

217
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.366
but we can beat it.

218
00:12:38.366 --> 00:12:40.977
I can help you if you let me.

219
00:12:40.977 --> 00:12:44.589
Always seeing the best
in your enemies

220
00:12:44.589 --> 00:12:50.378
and the worst
in your so-called allies.

221
00:12:50.378 --> 00:12:54.121
- How would you know that?
- Because I know who you are:

222
00:12:54.121 --> 00:12:56.601
a pathetic excuse for a hero.

223
00:12:56.601 --> 00:12:59.779
more than willing to stab
his friends in the back.

224
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:06.176
What did I do to you?
What do you want with me?

225
00:13:08.918 --> 00:13:12.748
Nothing that can't be
easily taken.

226
00:13:12.748 --> 00:13:17.318
You see. you're just
one part of my plan.

227
00:13:17.318 --> 00:13:18.841
There's someone else

228
00:13:18.841 --> 00:13:22.627
who's far more important
than you.

229
00:13:22.627 --> 00:13:27.545
someone who will ensure
my success...

230
00:13:27.545 --> 00:13:30.200
Your lightning rod.

231
00:13:33.377 --> 00:13:34.683
Iris.

232
00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:54.355
Hello?

233
00:14:03.103 --> 00:14:06.236
Hello?
Who's there?

234
00:14:06.236 --> 00:14:08.238
<i>Iris West-Allen?</i>

235
00:14:18.074 --> 00:14:20.424
Ryan Wilder?

236
00:14:30.652 --> 00:14:32.306
One second. I'm crossing
the bridge into Central City.

237
00:14:32.306 --> 00:14:34.830
The next. this wave
passed over my car.

238
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.093
It killed my battery.
fried the voltage cable.

239
00:14:37.093 --> 00:14:40.183
and burnt my arm like some
kind of electromagnetic pulse.

240
00:14:40.183 --> 00:14:42.490
I think I know who did this.

241
00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.058
We've been dealing
with a new enemy.

242
00:14:45.058 --> 00:14:48.452
Barry thinks he's the Avatar
of the Negative Speed Force.

243
00:14:48.452 --> 00:14:50.280
Let me guess:

244
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.283
they're an evil speedster
who wears red armor.

245
00:14:53.283 --> 00:14:56.199
Yeah. a few days back.
I was on patrol in Gotham.

246
00:14:56.199 --> 00:14:59.986
This speedster blindsided me.
beat my ass.

247
00:14:59.986 --> 00:15:02.031
left me for dead
outside the Palisades.

248
00:15:02.031 --> 00:15:04.381
Called himself the Red Death.

249
00:15:04.381 --> 00:15:07.167
When he attacked you.
did he steal anything--

250
00:15:07.167 --> 00:15:08.908
gear. tech?

251
00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:10.822
Yeah. he ransacked
my utility belt.

252
00:15:10.822 --> 00:15:12.868
How'd you guess?

253
00:15:12.868 --> 00:15:14.957
This Red Death
has been handing out weapons

254
00:15:14.957 --> 00:15:17.960
to his new allies: advanced
versions of Wayne tech.

255
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.744
Yeah. well. I could have used
that equipment.

256
00:15:19.744 --> 00:15:21.964
It took me forever to drag
myself back to the Batcave.

257
00:15:21.964 --> 00:15:23.661
Then Luke told me
you guys were looking for me.

258
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:26.534
so I thought I'd just show up
and pay you a visit.

259
00:15:26.534 --> 00:15:28.579
You got from Gotham
to Central City in a day?

260
00:15:28.579 --> 00:15:30.799
My car drives really fast.

261
00:15:32.322 --> 00:15:34.194
But not as fast
as your husband.

262
00:15:34.194 --> 00:15:36.239
Where is Barry. anyway?
- He's at S.T.A.R. Labs--

263
00:15:36.239 --> 00:15:37.937
at least. I don't know.
I think he is.

264
00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:40.940
My phone stopped working
when the power went out.

265
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.333
Well. I appreciate
you bandaging me up

266
00:15:43.333 --> 00:15:46.380
in the middle of all this.
but right now.

267
00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.557
I want to help you
take down this Red Death.

268
00:15:49.557 --> 00:15:53.300
Hit by an EMP. and now
back to crime fighting already.

269
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.303
Well. everybody's
got their limits.

270
00:15:56.303 --> 00:15:58.348
I. uh. ignore mine.

271
00:16:05.312 --> 00:16:07.314
This the brain trust
that lost the Flash?

272
00:16:07.314 --> 00:16:09.490
Oh. thank Crom.
You got our SOS.

273
00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:11.405
You think I wouldn't notice
someone tapping Morse code

274
00:16:11.405 --> 00:16:13.363
into my private frequency?
- Ugh.

275
00:16:13.363 --> 00:16:15.583
The blackout knocked out
every car battery in the city.

276
00:16:15.583 --> 00:16:17.063
so we had to hoof it over here.

277
00:16:17.063 --> 00:16:19.761
And we appreciate that. truly.

278
00:16:19.761 --> 00:16:21.589
Well...

279
00:16:21.589 --> 00:16:23.373
Yeah. so what do we do:

280
00:16:23.373 --> 00:16:26.246
mount a search party.
hit the known Rogue hangouts?

281
00:16:26.246 --> 00:16:28.465
Please. Garcia.

282
00:16:28.465 --> 00:16:30.206
I came prepared.

283
00:16:32.469 --> 00:16:33.775
Little help?

284
00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.605
Meet the
Harmonic Frequency Tracer.

285
00:16:37.605 --> 00:16:40.173
We set this to Flash's
vibrational biometrics.

286
00:16:40.173 --> 00:16:42.653
we can find him
anywhere on the planet.

287
00:16:42.653 --> 00:16:44.003
Now watch and learn.

288
00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:48.833
"No signal"?

289
00:16:48.833 --> 00:16:50.400
Something must be wrong
with your biometric system.

290
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.882
Or there's something wrong
with your toy.

291
00:16:53.882 --> 00:16:56.363
Come on. what's the first thing
you do to any detainee

292
00:16:56.363 --> 00:16:57.929
in this town?

293
00:16:57.929 --> 00:16:59.453
You meta-cuff 'em.

294
00:16:59.453 --> 00:17:01.368
If the Flash doesn't have
his speed.

295
00:17:01.368 --> 00:17:03.413
then the tracer's not--
- I'm aware of that.

296
00:17:06.721 --> 00:17:08.027
Leave Iris alone.

297
00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.332
She's got nothing
to do with this.

298
00:17:09.332 --> 00:17:12.988
Oh. but she does. Flash.

299
00:17:12.988 --> 00:17:15.817
Whatever happens to her...

300
00:17:15.817 --> 00:17:17.253
is on you.

301
00:17:17.253 --> 00:17:18.385
You don't understand.

302
00:17:18.385 --> 00:17:20.169
The negative speed inside you

303
00:17:20.169 --> 00:17:21.649
is clouding your mind.

304
00:17:21.649 --> 00:17:23.259
It's making you believe

305
00:17:23.259 --> 00:17:25.609
I've done something awful
to you. but I haven't!

306
00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:27.176
The Negative Speed Force--

307
00:17:27.176 --> 00:17:29.657
it wants to make you
its champion. its Avatar!

308
00:17:29.657 --> 00:17:31.789
That's why it gave you
these powers.

309
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:33.965
so it could pit you against me!

310
00:17:33.965 --> 00:17:37.795
It wants to upset
the balance of reality.

311
00:17:37.795 --> 00:17:41.886
Is that where you think
I get my powers from. Flash?

312
00:17:43.236 --> 00:17:46.108
And then. I'm some kind
of herald

313
00:17:46.108 --> 00:17:48.328
for the dark cosmos?

314
00:17:48.328 --> 00:17:51.766
Oh. no. Flash.

315
00:18:00.383 --> 00:18:02.081
What the hell?

316
00:18:03.778 --> 00:18:07.477
I'm something
far more powerful.

317
00:18:12.439 --> 00:18:15.355
Your armor--
you're controlling it remotely.

318
00:18:15.355 --> 00:18:17.705
I built this armor

319
00:18:17.705 --> 00:18:20.925
just like I built my own speed.

320
00:18:20.925 --> 00:18:24.494
which means
I don't require the aid

321
00:18:24.494 --> 00:18:27.802
of any pathetic
Negative Forces.

322
00:18:27.802 --> 00:18:29.630
You're not the Avatar.

323
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.762
Your speed's artificial.

324
00:18:31.762 --> 00:18:34.765
Only organic speed
can power the treadmill.

325
00:18:36.376 --> 00:18:38.334
That's why I'm here.

326
00:18:38.334 --> 00:18:41.903
You will be
my fuel source. Flash.

327
00:18:41.903 --> 00:18:44.514
And once you start running.

328
00:18:44.514 --> 00:18:48.910
you won't stop until you die.

329
00:18:53.567 --> 00:18:57.397
<i>Only organic
speed can power the treadmill.</i>

330
00:18:57.397 --> 00:18:59.660
<i>That's why I'm here.</i>

331
00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.271
Are you okay?

332
00:19:02.271 --> 00:19:03.925
Yeah. yeah.

333
00:19:03.925 --> 00:19:07.537
It's just--
it's been a long day.

334
00:19:07.537 --> 00:19:09.713
So. uh. you must stay busy.

335
00:19:09.713 --> 00:19:12.542
You run that company.
CCC Media. right?

336
00:19:14.675 --> 00:19:16.546
Yeah. I do.

337
00:19:16.546 --> 00:19:19.114
We don't have much
of an audience in Gotham.

338
00:19:19.114 --> 00:19:23.553
Yeah. well. I'm a big fan
of the podcast.

339
00:19:23.553 --> 00:19:25.773
Any cream?

340
00:19:25.773 --> 00:19:28.558
Uh. no. I'm okay.

341
00:19:28.558 --> 00:19:31.692
All right. so the Red Death
has got all of his pieces

342
00:19:31.692 --> 00:19:33.955
that he needs
for his treadmill.

343
00:19:33.955 --> 00:19:37.698
Any idea
what he has planned next?

344
00:19:37.698 --> 00:19:39.743
Uh. no.
No idea.

345
00:19:39.743 --> 00:19:42.790
But the blackout

346
00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.575
has gotta be connected somehow.

347
00:19:45.575 --> 00:19:47.838
Well. it looks
like he's got plenty of help.

348
00:19:47.838 --> 00:19:49.797
Yeah.

349
00:19:49.797 --> 00:19:51.190
Thankfully. so does Barry.

350
00:19:53.627 --> 00:19:55.890
He's working
with criminals. too?

351
00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.544
Reformed...

352
00:19:57.544 --> 00:19:59.589
mostly.

353
00:19:59.589 --> 00:20:01.069
There's no such thing.

354
00:20:05.813 --> 00:20:07.118
No. I get it.

355
00:20:07.118 --> 00:20:09.208
If my adoptive mother

356
00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:12.820
was killed
by the Royal Flush Gang.

357
00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.517
I wouldn't trust Rogues either.

358
00:20:14.517 --> 00:20:17.520
Yeah. but. you know.
that was...

359
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.218
that was a long time ago.

360
00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.789
Was it something I said?

361
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:27.487
Ryan Wilder's mother
was killed

362
00:20:27.487 --> 00:20:29.271
by the Wonderland Gang.

363
00:20:29.271 --> 00:20:32.187
The real Ryan has never been
in this house. either.

364
00:20:32.187 --> 00:20:35.930
but here you are. walking
around like you own the place.

365
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:37.671
So who the hell are you?

366
00:20:41.588 --> 00:20:43.677
Iris...

367
00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:48.421
This is gonna be hard
to believe.

368
00:20:48.421 --> 00:20:53.077
But where I'm from.
I'm your best friend.

369
00:20:53.077 --> 00:20:56.516
Okay. my name is Ryan Wilder.
but I'm from another timeline.

370
00:20:56.516 --> 00:20:59.170
one just like this one.
except for there.

371
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.782
the Flash is
the world's greatest villain.

372
00:21:09.442 --> 00:21:11.835
It's you. isn't it?

373
00:21:11.835 --> 00:21:13.272
Red Death.

374
00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:15.143
Are you here to kill me?

375
00:21:15.143 --> 00:21:17.580
If I wanted to hurt you.
I would have done it already.

376
00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.756
So. what. you're just here
to lie to me for fun?

377
00:21:19.756 --> 00:21:21.976
If I showed up saying
I was your Big Bad.

378
00:21:21.976 --> 00:21:23.847
you would have thrown me
in the Pipeline.

379
00:21:23.847 --> 00:21:25.458
I know you. Iris.

380
00:21:25.458 --> 00:21:27.721
I thought
if you got to know me.

381
00:21:27.721 --> 00:21:29.505
if we formed a connection
before I had to drop this bomb.

382
00:21:29.505 --> 00:21:31.159
you'd hear me out.

383
00:21:31.159 --> 00:21:32.726
I want the truth.

384
00:21:34.075 --> 00:21:37.513
Where I'm from.
there is no Batman.

385
00:21:37.513 --> 00:21:40.255
The Waynes adopted me
when I was only days old.

386
00:21:40.255 --> 00:21:42.344
and when they were gunned down
in the alley.

387
00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:44.868
I swore to protect
my city at all costs.

388
00:21:44.868 --> 00:21:49.003
For ten years. I locked up
the dregs of society--

389
00:21:49.003 --> 00:21:53.094
Hush. Simon Hurt.
even my own brother--

390
00:21:53.094 --> 00:21:55.531
only to see them escape Arkham

391
00:21:55.531 --> 00:21:59.143
and go right back
to preying on the innocent.

392
00:21:59.143 --> 00:22:03.278
I was Gotham's protector.
and I was losing the fight.

393
00:22:03.278 --> 00:22:05.715
So I did what had to be done.

394
00:22:05.715 --> 00:22:09.937
I studied the technology
of my enemies.

395
00:22:09.937 --> 00:22:13.680
and I engineered
my own versions of it.

396
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.378
So that's where the Rogues'
new weapons come from.

397
00:22:16.378 --> 00:22:18.467
Eventually...

398
00:22:18.467 --> 00:22:22.166
I decided to study
the abilities of other heroes.

399
00:22:22.166 --> 00:22:24.865
starting with my ally
from the League.

400
00:22:24.865 --> 00:22:26.954
Flash.

401
00:22:26.954 --> 00:22:29.478
I mined the data
from Flash's suit

402
00:22:29.478 --> 00:22:32.742
and used it
to create my own armor.

403
00:22:32.742 --> 00:22:36.746
my own artificial Speed Force.

404
00:22:36.746 --> 00:22:38.313
You really expect me
to believe

405
00:22:38.313 --> 00:22:40.141
that you stole super speed
to fight crime?

406
00:22:40.141 --> 00:22:43.144
Not fight. eliminate.

407
00:22:43.144 --> 00:22:44.754
With Flash's power.

408
00:22:44.754 --> 00:22:46.539
I could put a criminal
behind bars

409
00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:49.280
before they even thought
of committing a crime.

410
00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.065
Don't you see?

411
00:22:51.065 --> 00:22:54.416
The people of Gotham--
they were suffering.

412
00:22:54.416 --> 00:22:57.376
They deserved a hero who
could make a real difference.

413
00:22:57.376 --> 00:23:01.118
I found a way
to stop crime permanently.

414
00:23:01.118 --> 00:23:02.990
something he failed
to accomplish.

415
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:05.253
So he freed his Rogues
from Iron Heights

416
00:23:05.253 --> 00:23:07.647
and led them
on a war against me.

417
00:23:07.647 --> 00:23:09.779
They tore apart my entire city
trying to kill me.

418
00:23:09.779 --> 00:23:12.478
Why would the Flash
do something like that?

419
00:23:12.478 --> 00:23:14.871
Even the Flash
has his demons.

420
00:23:14.871 --> 00:23:16.743
I tried to hide
in the Speed Force.

421
00:23:16.743 --> 00:23:19.963
but my speed's not organic.
so it rejected me.

422
00:23:19.963 --> 00:23:22.879
When it threw me out.
I ended up in this timeline.

423
00:23:22.879 --> 00:23:24.620
but I need to go back.

424
00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.448
And that's why you need
the cosmic treadmill.

425
00:23:26.448 --> 00:23:28.755
My Flash was out of control.

426
00:23:28.755 --> 00:23:31.018
I can only imagine
what he's done in my world

427
00:23:31.018 --> 00:23:33.412
since I've been gone.

428
00:23:33.412 --> 00:23:35.239
Iris...

429
00:23:35.239 --> 00:23:38.678
you're Flash's lightning rod
in every timeline.

430
00:23:38.678 --> 00:23:41.420
You can convince him
to stand down

431
00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.988
and end this Rogue war
he started.

432
00:23:44.988 --> 00:23:46.816
Please.

433
00:23:46.816 --> 00:23:48.557
You're my only hope.

434
00:23:51.995 --> 00:23:55.129
Joe. I do not need to use
my empathic abilities

435
00:23:55.129 --> 00:24:00.177
to know that there is something
that you are not telling me.

436
00:24:00.177 --> 00:24:01.396
So what?
What is it?

437
00:24:01.396 --> 00:24:03.703
Why this sudden rush

438
00:24:03.703 --> 00:24:05.095
to get out of Central City?

439
00:24:05.095 --> 00:24:08.272
What is it really about?

440
00:24:08.272 --> 00:24:11.667
You know I tried really hard
raising my kids.

441
00:24:14.365 --> 00:24:16.455
But back then.

442
00:24:16.455 --> 00:24:20.371
when Iris was Jenna's age...

443
00:24:20.371 --> 00:24:22.461
she had to grow up
with a father

444
00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:25.464
who might go to work
in the morning.

445
00:24:25.464 --> 00:24:27.901
never come back.

446
00:24:27.901 --> 00:24:30.773
Wally. poor kid. for the
first 20 years of his life

447
00:24:30.773 --> 00:24:33.384
thought I'd ran out on him.

448
00:24:33.384 --> 00:24:36.083
They had to deal with burdens

449
00:24:36.083 --> 00:24:38.651
I wish they didn't have
to carry.

450
00:24:38.651 --> 00:24:42.872
I know. but. baby. you gave
them everything that you had.

451
00:24:42.872 --> 00:24:45.701
Cecile...

452
00:24:45.701 --> 00:24:47.877
we have the chance

453
00:24:47.877 --> 00:24:52.099
to raise Jenna in a place
where she--

454
00:24:52.099 --> 00:24:55.058
where she doesn't have
to hide in her room

455
00:24:55.058 --> 00:24:58.497
because there's
a supercharged blackout.

456
00:25:02.892 --> 00:25:04.720
I want us...

457
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:10.509
To give Jenna...

458
00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:13.076
what I couldn't give Iris
and Wally...

459
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.648
A normal childhood.

460
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:43.237
Here...
while no one's watching us.

461
00:25:43.237 --> 00:25:45.326
No. thanks.

462
00:25:45.326 --> 00:25:47.415
You're no good to us dead.

463
00:25:49.504 --> 00:25:52.942
Mark. you don't have
to do this.

464
00:25:52.942 --> 00:25:56.859
If I want Frost back. I do.

465
00:25:56.859 --> 00:25:59.166
What happens when
she turns on that treadmill

466
00:25:59.166 --> 00:26:01.081
and busts
a hole in the timeline?

467
00:26:01.081 --> 00:26:03.344
Or decides it's a lot easier
to just kill you

468
00:26:03.344 --> 00:26:05.346
than help you bring Frost back?

469
00:26:08.305 --> 00:26:11.482
If I die. I die.
Who would even care?

470
00:26:11.482 --> 00:26:14.311
You are a part of Team Flash.

471
00:26:14.311 --> 00:26:16.575
No. I'm not...

472
00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:18.925
not anymore.

473
00:26:18.925 --> 00:26:21.057
Now I'm just another dirtbag
who double-crossed you.

474
00:26:21.057 --> 00:26:22.145
Aren't I?
- Mark!

475
00:26:24.191 --> 00:26:27.586
Before Frost was one
of my best friends.

476
00:26:27.586 --> 00:26:28.717
she tried to kill me.

477
00:26:30.719 --> 00:26:34.114
People make mistakes.

478
00:26:34.114 --> 00:26:35.855
I was so desperate

479
00:26:35.855 --> 00:26:38.335
not to make the same mistakes
I made with Thawne

480
00:26:38.335 --> 00:26:40.033
that I rushed into thinking
the Red Death

481
00:26:40.033 --> 00:26:41.687
was the new Avatar.

482
00:26:41.687 --> 00:26:44.777
But. actually.
she's a new threat.

483
00:26:44.777 --> 00:26:46.822
one I wasn't ready for.

484
00:26:46.822 --> 00:26:49.259
and now the whole world might
have to pay for my mistake.

485
00:26:49.259 --> 00:26:52.567
and the only one that can help
me out of this is you.

486
00:26:52.567 --> 00:26:54.917
Me?

487
00:26:54.917 --> 00:26:58.747
You've got the wrong guy.

488
00:26:58.747 --> 00:27:01.445
It's too late for me.
- No. you're wrong.

489
00:27:01.445 --> 00:27:03.709
It's never too late
for second chances.

490
00:27:08.409 --> 00:27:10.672
Look. maybe I didn't go
about this the right way.

491
00:27:10.672 --> 00:27:13.109
But. Iris. you are
his lightning rod.

492
00:27:13.109 --> 00:27:14.589
You can calm him down.
make a truce.

493
00:27:14.589 --> 00:27:15.764
Wouldn't it be easier

494
00:27:15.764 --> 00:27:17.810
to convince your Iris to help?

495
00:27:19.942 --> 00:27:22.031
I tried that.

496
00:27:22.031 --> 00:27:25.469
We had a falling-out when
the Flash turned against me.

497
00:27:28.037 --> 00:27:30.039
I don't believe you.

498
00:27:30.039 --> 00:27:31.737
You and Iris were best friends.

499
00:27:31.737 --> 00:27:34.174
You knew her better
than anyone in the world.

500
00:27:34.174 --> 00:27:36.350
If things really were
as dire as you say.

501
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:38.221
why wouldn't she help?

502
00:27:43.226 --> 00:27:44.750
Because she can't.

503
00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:54.455
When the Flash and the Rogues
were attacking me...

504
00:27:54.455 --> 00:27:56.457
I was dead to rights.

505
00:27:58.677 --> 00:28:00.591
All I could do was throw
a lightning bolt

506
00:28:00.591 --> 00:28:03.290
and hope it landed.

507
00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:04.900
It was meant
for the Flash. but--

508
00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.772
You killed her.

509
00:28:08.643 --> 00:28:10.645
It was an accident.

510
00:28:12.342 --> 00:28:16.303
But if my Iris were alive...

511
00:28:16.303 --> 00:28:18.131
she would help me do it.
I know it.

512
00:28:18.131 --> 00:28:19.698
But she's not.

513
00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.311
That part. I believe.

514
00:28:24.311 --> 00:28:27.531
It's the rest of your story
that I'm struggling with.

515
00:28:27.531 --> 00:28:29.664
You see. we have this thing
in journalism

516
00:28:29.664 --> 00:28:31.274
called a Red Team.

517
00:28:31.274 --> 00:28:33.320
And before we go to print
with any big story.

518
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.974
we put together
a group of reporters

519
00:28:34.974 --> 00:28:37.106
and have them try
to poke holes in it.

520
00:28:37.106 --> 00:28:39.108
make sure we're airtight.

521
00:28:39.108 --> 00:28:41.807
If I was Red Teaming
your story.

522
00:28:41.807 --> 00:28:45.462
I would take another look
at why the Flash turned on you.

523
00:28:45.462 --> 00:28:48.030
You said it was
because he was jealous.

524
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:49.989
but you're the one

525
00:28:49.989 --> 00:28:52.818
who's obsessed with
your enemies' technologies.

526
00:28:52.818 --> 00:28:54.558
You're the one
trying to stop crimes

527
00:28:54.558 --> 00:28:56.996
before people can even think
about committing them.

528
00:28:56.996 --> 00:28:59.563
Did the Flash really turn
against you.

529
00:28:59.563 --> 00:29:02.175
or did he see your thirst for
power and try to take you down?

530
00:29:02.175 --> 00:29:03.872
You're twisting my words.

531
00:29:03.872 --> 00:29:06.048
Why are you trying to take me
to your timeline?

532
00:29:06.048 --> 00:29:08.268
Do you really want a truce.

533
00:29:08.268 --> 00:29:10.052
or are you using me as bait
to bring your Flash out?

534
00:29:10.052 --> 00:29:12.359
I am trying to protect
my city.

535
00:29:12.359 --> 00:29:14.709
You don't want peace
with the Flash.

536
00:29:14.709 --> 00:29:16.450
You want to kill him.

537
00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:18.104
You're damn right I do!

538
00:29:22.325 --> 00:29:24.632
Oh. Iris.

539
00:29:26.329 --> 00:29:28.592
I wanted you to choose this

540
00:29:28.592 --> 00:29:31.857
so that maybe.
when the dust settled.

541
00:29:31.857 --> 00:29:33.554
I could get my friend back.

542
00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:37.688
But I guess it's
not meant to be.

543
00:29:39.908 --> 00:29:43.172
I wanted to do this
the easy way.

544
00:29:43.172 --> 00:29:45.348
But you want to get nuts?

545
00:30:04.846 --> 00:30:06.892
Come on.

546
00:30:06.892 --> 00:30:09.068
Let's get nuts.

547
00:30:25.258 --> 00:30:27.564
- Iris?
- Flash.

548
00:30:27.564 --> 00:30:31.090
- Are you okay?
- Well. it's up to you. Flash.

549
00:30:34.223 --> 00:30:36.835
Ryan Wilder?

550
00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:39.663
I'm just a woman
trying to get home.

551
00:30:39.663 --> 00:30:43.624
Now. you're gonna run
until you can't run anymore.

552
00:30:43.624 --> 00:30:45.713
And if you don't. she dies.

553
00:30:45.713 --> 00:30:47.149
That's not true.
She needs me alive.

554
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:48.498
But I don't need
you undamaged.

555
00:30:48.498 --> 00:30:51.327
Stop. stop!

556
00:30:53.155 --> 00:30:54.896
- I'll do it.
- No. don't.

557
00:30:54.896 --> 00:30:56.289
I won't let her hurt you.

558
00:31:02.469 --> 00:31:05.211
Deactivating meta-cuff.

559
00:31:24.447 --> 00:31:26.667
Engaging vibration engine.

560
00:31:55.174 --> 00:31:57.132
You want her to have
a normal life. Joe?

561
00:31:57.132 --> 00:31:58.873
This is--
- Mommy. Daddy.

562
00:31:58.873 --> 00:32:00.309
Jenna. it's okay.

563
00:32:20.808 --> 00:32:22.723
Joe. get her.

564
00:32:24.768 --> 00:32:27.032
Sweetheart.
You're okay.

565
00:32:30.774 --> 00:32:33.038
Oh. a really huge wave of fear.

566
00:32:33.038 --> 00:32:35.431
Joe. the Zajacs' house
has been hit. too.

567
00:32:35.431 --> 00:32:37.085
I need to help them.

568
00:33:01.327 --> 00:33:04.765
- I think that it's working.
- Oh. frak. yeah. it is.

569
00:33:04.765 --> 00:33:06.158
Flash is out by Route 119.

570
00:33:06.158 --> 00:33:07.768
Well. let's go get him
right now.

571
00:33:07.768 --> 00:33:09.248
How do you suppose we do that?

572
00:33:09.248 --> 00:33:10.989
You got a teleporter
we don't know about?

573
00:33:10.989 --> 00:33:13.600
Actually. I do.

574
00:33:18.431 --> 00:33:20.085
Mark. please.

575
00:33:20.085 --> 00:33:22.043
You don't have to do this.
You still have a choice.

576
00:33:22.043 --> 00:33:23.610
No. he doesn't.

577
00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:25.438
I'm giving him
the one thing he wants.

578
00:33:25.438 --> 00:33:27.657
what your team refuses to give.

579
00:33:27.657 --> 00:33:30.008
It's too late.

580
00:33:34.534 --> 00:33:35.926
It's never too late.

581
00:33:55.381 --> 00:33:57.557
- Barry. are you okay?
- Yeah.

582
00:34:01.735 --> 00:34:03.215
Mark?

583
00:34:03.215 --> 00:34:05.130
What did you do?

584
00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:07.045
I overloaded the capacitors.

585
00:34:07.045 --> 00:34:09.786
So. instead of turning your
organic speed into a wormhole.

586
00:34:09.786 --> 00:34:11.179
the treadmill shot it
all back at her.

587
00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:13.007
Overwhelming
her artificial speed.

588
00:34:13.007 --> 00:34:15.357
Yeah.
The treadmill's toast now.

589
00:34:15.357 --> 00:34:17.664
And we gotta boogie.
- Hang on.

590
00:34:17.664 --> 00:34:19.013
The treadmill drained too much
of my speed.

591
00:34:19.013 --> 00:34:20.406
I can't run.

592
00:34:20.406 --> 00:34:21.581
Where do you think
you're going?

593
00:34:24.453 --> 00:34:26.455
I'll hold them off.

594
00:34:26.455 --> 00:34:28.240
- Mark.
- Go!

595
00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.156
You think you can
double-cross us. huh. Ken doll?

596
00:34:31.156 --> 00:34:33.897
Actually. yeah. I do.

597
00:34:44.821 --> 00:34:47.476
- I've gotta help him.
- No. no.

598
00:34:47.476 --> 00:34:49.261
Somebody order
a prison break?

599
00:34:49.261 --> 00:34:50.697
How'd you guys
know we were here?

600
00:34:50.697 --> 00:34:52.481
Long story.
We'll tell you later.

601
00:34:55.223 --> 00:34:57.486
We gotta get Mark.

602
00:34:57.486 --> 00:35:00.098
No. the suit's recharging.
We gotta go right now.

603
00:35:00.098 --> 00:35:02.970
No. I'm not gonna leave him
behind!

604
00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:04.754
What are you doing?
- Without your speed.

605
00:35:04.754 --> 00:35:06.278
the monster
will slaughter us all.

606
00:35:06.278 --> 00:35:07.453
- Hey. what are you doing?
- Hey. come on!

607
00:35:07.453 --> 00:35:09.672
Hey!

608
00:35:11.413 --> 00:35:12.414
Stop!

609
00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:18.681
Mark.

610
00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:35.568
This isn't right.

611
00:35:35.568 --> 00:35:36.873
We shouldn't have left him there.

612
00:35:36.873 --> 00:35:37.961
What. no "thanks
for saving our sorry asses"?

613
00:35:37.961 --> 00:35:39.572
It's not the way
we do things!

614
00:35:39.572 --> 00:35:42.227
We don't leave people behind!
- What choice did we have?

615
00:35:42.227 --> 00:35:45.143
Without your speed. that psycho
would have killed all of us.

616
00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:46.535
not just Mark.

617
00:35:46.535 --> 00:35:48.450
What about Mark?

618
00:35:51.845 --> 00:35:55.327
I'm sorry.
He didn't make it out.

619
00:35:57.024 --> 00:35:59.157
Well. then we have
to go back for him.

620
00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:00.984
He's dead. lady.

621
00:36:00.984 --> 00:36:02.769
And even if he weren't.
why would we risk our hides

622
00:36:02.769 --> 00:36:04.814
to go save the guy
who betrayed us?

623
00:36:04.814 --> 00:36:06.381
Mark saved Barry's life.

624
00:36:06.381 --> 00:36:08.078
He saw which way the wind
was blowing

625
00:36:08.078 --> 00:36:10.168
and switched sides. again.

626
00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:12.387
Like that's so different
than the rest of you?

627
00:36:12.387 --> 00:36:15.303
I do not like you.
- So what?

628
00:36:15.303 --> 00:36:18.219
So. everything
on this planet is connected.

629
00:36:18.219 --> 00:36:20.395
We are all part
of a greater whole.

630
00:36:20.395 --> 00:36:22.963
Mark's life doesn't matter
any less than the rest of you.

631
00:36:22.963 --> 00:36:24.530
Are you seriously defending

632
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.532
the guy who tried
to turn you into his dead ex?

633
00:36:26.532 --> 00:36:29.535
Yes. because throwing away
even one life

634
00:36:29.535 --> 00:36:31.363
is absolutely senseless.

635
00:36:33.626 --> 00:36:36.933
Caitlin's right.
We can't lose anyone else.

636
00:36:36.933 --> 00:36:39.284
We need to figure out
Red Death's next move.

637
00:36:39.284 --> 00:36:41.155
She still has the whole city
under blackout.

638
00:36:41.155 --> 00:36:43.157
Mark destroyed
her treadmill. right?

639
00:36:43.157 --> 00:36:47.422
So. well. maybe she'll just
pack it up and go home.

640
00:36:47.422 --> 00:36:49.294
She can't.

641
00:36:49.294 --> 00:36:51.687
She's from
a different timeline.

642
00:36:51.687 --> 00:36:53.646
Everything she's done
is about getting revenge

643
00:36:53.646 --> 00:36:55.474
on her own version
of the Flash.

644
00:36:55.474 --> 00:36:57.606
Well. that's just great.

645
00:36:57.606 --> 00:37:00.653
She probably hates you as much
as she hates the other one.

646
00:37:00.653 --> 00:37:02.959
Damn. you're just
as responsible

647
00:37:02.959 --> 00:37:04.874
for destroying her ride
as Mark is.

648
00:37:04.874 --> 00:37:07.573
Which means that whatever
she's planning next.

649
00:37:07.573 --> 00:37:09.183
it's only gonna get worse.

650
00:37:14.493 --> 00:37:17.365
Hey.

651
00:37:17.365 --> 00:37:20.499
I can't believe it.

652
00:37:20.499 --> 00:37:21.848
Mark's dead?

653
00:37:23.676 --> 00:37:25.591
I know.

654
00:37:25.591 --> 00:37:27.375
And...

655
00:37:27.375 --> 00:37:29.203
Chuck...

656
00:37:29.203 --> 00:37:30.596
I know I've been the one

657
00:37:30.596 --> 00:37:32.989
avoiding having
this conversation.

658
00:37:32.989 --> 00:37:35.818
But after tonight.
it just reminded me

659
00:37:35.818 --> 00:37:39.213
of how little time
any of us might have left.

660
00:37:39.213 --> 00:37:43.391
And so I--I think
I'm ready to...

661
00:37:43.391 --> 00:37:45.306
talk...

662
00:37:45.306 --> 00:37:47.613
you know. a--about us.

663
00:37:56.622 --> 00:38:00.365
Allegra. um...

664
00:38:00.365 --> 00:38:02.628
I--I...

665
00:38:02.628 --> 00:38:06.632
can't believe I'm saying this.
but. um. uh...

666
00:38:06.632 --> 00:38:08.373
look. our satellites
are still down.

667
00:38:08.373 --> 00:38:11.680
and we still barely have
any power.

668
00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:15.641
And now. with Mark...

669
00:38:15.641 --> 00:38:18.121
maybe our timing
just isn't right.

670
00:38:20.515 --> 00:38:22.430
Yeah. of course.

671
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:25.259
I can't believe
I brought that up.

672
00:38:25.259 --> 00:38:28.001
That was stupid.
- No. no. it's not.

673
00:38:28.001 --> 00:38:29.785
It's not stupid.

674
00:38:29.785 --> 00:38:33.789
'cause. look. as soon
as we send Red Death packing.

675
00:38:33.789 --> 00:38:35.661
we're gonna sit down...

676
00:38:38.316 --> 00:38:41.449
And we're gonna figure out
what all this is.

677
00:39:00.033 --> 00:39:01.687
You doing okay. babe?

678
00:39:01.687 --> 00:39:03.166
Hmm?

679
00:39:03.166 --> 00:39:04.690
You look a little down

680
00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:07.301
for somebody
who just saved her daughter

681
00:39:07.301 --> 00:39:09.869
and the neighborhood.
- I don't know.

682
00:39:09.869 --> 00:39:11.479
I just--

683
00:39:11.479 --> 00:39:14.787
I keep thinking
about that lightning.

684
00:39:14.787 --> 00:39:17.093
You realize if it had hit
a few feet higher.

685
00:39:17.093 --> 00:39:20.445
it would have blown a hole
straight into Jenna's bedroom.

686
00:39:20.445 --> 00:39:23.012
I don't know. babe.

687
00:39:23.012 --> 00:39:24.797
Maybe you're right.

688
00:39:24.797 --> 00:39:29.367
Maybe the city isn't
a safe place to raise our girl.

689
00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:32.021
Hey. nugget.
- I drew you a picture.

690
00:39:32.021 --> 00:39:33.632
- What?
- What is it?

691
00:39:33.632 --> 00:39:35.111
It's Mommy saving the day.

692
00:39:35.111 --> 00:39:37.287
That's right. baby girl.

693
00:39:37.287 --> 00:39:39.507
Mommy is a superhero.

694
00:39:39.507 --> 00:39:42.771
And she ain't stopping
anytime soon.

695
00:39:44.425 --> 00:39:46.775
Little one...

696
00:39:46.775 --> 00:39:49.691
time to go back to bed.

697
00:39:49.691 --> 00:39:51.911
- Be up in a sec. okay?
- Okay.

698
00:39:57.090 --> 00:39:59.397
I don't understand.

699
00:39:59.397 --> 00:40:03.139
Listen. we both want Jenna

700
00:40:03.139 --> 00:40:07.013
to have a safe
and normal childhood.

701
00:40:07.013 --> 00:40:09.363
But I also want her to grow up

702
00:40:09.363 --> 00:40:12.322
knowing she can be anything
she wants.

703
00:40:12.322 --> 00:40:13.976
just like her mom.

704
00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:19.329
What are we telling
that little girl up there

705
00:40:19.329 --> 00:40:21.114
if you quit now?

706
00:40:23.899 --> 00:40:25.292
Yeah.

707
00:40:28.208 --> 00:40:30.079
So we can stay in Central City?

708
00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:50.970
It's gone.

709
00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:55.365
All my work. my dreams...

710
00:40:55.365 --> 00:41:00.196
crushed by the Flash again!

711
00:41:00.196 --> 00:41:04.331
So what do you want us
to do now. or...

712
00:41:07.595 --> 00:41:09.597
The Flash...

713
00:41:09.597 --> 00:41:12.165
won't let me go back
to my world...

714
00:41:15.603 --> 00:41:18.214
So I'll take his.

715
00:41:18.214 --> 00:41:21.827
But this time. we will bring

716
00:41:21.827 --> 00:41:24.438
the war to him!

717
00:41:53.728 --> 00:41:55.251
Greg. move your head.
