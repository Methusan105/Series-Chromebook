<i>Previously on "The Flash"...</i>

2
00:00:03.394 --> 00:00:04.482
Ah!

3
00:00:06.093 --> 00:00:07.398
Congratulations.

4
00:00:07.398 --> 00:00:08.834
You're pregnant.
- I'm not supposed

5
00:00:08.834 --> 00:00:10.271
to be pregnant
for another three months.

6
00:00:10.271 --> 00:00:11.881
That's new.

7
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:14.492
I am telekinetic.

8
00:00:14.492 --> 00:00:16.146
Whoa!

9
00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:18.105
Her name's Becky Sharpe.
She's a meta.

10
00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:19.584
<i>When good things
happen to her.</i>

11
00:00:19.584 --> 00:00:20.759
<i>bad things happen
all around her.</i>

12
00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:22.370
Did it just get cold in here?

13
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.154
I'm feeling kind of warm.

14
00:00:24.154 --> 00:00:26.330
<i>I guess there's only
one thing left to do.</i>

15
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.853
<i>When did this happen?</i>

16
00:00:27.853 --> 00:00:29.899
Better question is.
what took so long?

17
00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:33.990
You are the hero
Team Flash needs right now.

18
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.948
You come on the weekends.

19
00:00:35.948 --> 00:00:38.821
I'm gonna miss
seeing you guys every day.

20
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:40.170
I love you.

21
00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:47.830
<i>My name is Becky Sharpe.</i>

22
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.006
<i>and I'm the luckiest woman alive.</i>

23
00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:51.616
<i>You've heard of meta-humans.
right?</i>

24
00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:53.227
<i>Well. I'm one of them.</i>

25
00:00:53.227 --> 00:00:55.446
<i>which means me and Lady Luck
are BFFs.</i>

26
00:00:55.446 --> 00:00:58.058
<i>And yes. my powers
did used to hurt people.</i>

27
00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.537
<i>but not anymore.</i>

28
00:00:59.537 --> 00:01:00.712
<i>Not since I survived
a little--</i>

29
00:01:00.712 --> 00:01:01.931
Crisis.

30
00:01:04.977 --> 00:01:06.370
Nice catch!

31
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.024
I guess it's my lucky day.

32
00:01:08.024 --> 00:01:09.982
<i>Turns out it was mine. too!</i>

33
00:01:09.982 --> 00:01:13.160
<i>Yep. I fell into the arms
of the sweetest. funniest.</i>

34
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.988
<i>most caring man
I have ever met.</i>

35
00:01:15.988 --> 00:01:19.905
<i>♪ Everybody. sunshine.
lollipops. and rainbows ♪</i>

36
00:01:19.905 --> 00:01:21.168
Will you marry me?

37
00:01:21.168 --> 00:01:23.126
Yes!

38
00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:28.305
<i>Yeah. everything was perfect.</i>

39
00:01:28.305 --> 00:01:29.959
<i>Then we got engaged.</i>

40
00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:32.222
<i>and everything changed overnight.</i>

41
00:01:32.222 --> 00:01:34.398
<i>My luck suddenly ran out.</i>

42
00:01:34.398 --> 00:01:35.747
Oh?

43
00:01:35.747 --> 00:01:37.445
<i>One minute. I'm the happiest</i>

44
00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:39.664
<i>I've ever been
in my tiny life.</i>

45
00:01:41.144 --> 00:01:43.842
<i>The next.
my BFF Luck is like.</i>

46
00:01:43.842 --> 00:01:47.019
<i>"TTYL. Becky! LOL!
Poop emoji."</i>

47
00:01:51.198 --> 00:01:53.504
<i>Now no matter what I do.</i>

48
00:01:53.504 --> 00:01:55.767
<i>the universe
is out to punish me.</i>

49
00:02:01.686 --> 00:02:03.297
Oh--

50
00:02:04.863 --> 00:02:06.604
John!

51
00:02:06.604 --> 00:02:08.911
My key is stuck!

52
00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:15.309
<i>Yep. These days.
bad luck always finds me.</i>

53
00:02:16.484 --> 00:02:19.661
No!

54
00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:21.576
Freeze!
Hands in the air!

55
00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:27.321
So long story short.
I need a lawyer.

56
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:29.192
You think?

57
00:02:51.693 --> 00:02:53.347
I know. I know. baby.

58
00:02:53.347 --> 00:02:55.349
but did you get
the <i>organic</i> waffle mix?

59
00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.089
Yes. it matters!

60
00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:59.527
I want my birthday breakfast
with Jenna to be perfect.

61
00:02:59.527 --> 00:03:03.357
No--Joe. the house is fine.

62
00:03:03.357 --> 00:03:05.097
Yeah.

63
00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.060
Baby. everything is good.

64
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.367
Yeah. it's good.
I promise.

65
00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:15.630
No.
I am not gonna miss my train.

66
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.109
It's at 8:00.
I'm gonna be there.

67
00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.111
I will see you tonight.

68
00:03:19.111 --> 00:03:20.591
I love you. too.

69
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:21.853
Mm-hmm.

70
00:03:21.853 --> 00:03:24.291
Okay. bye.

71
00:03:32.473 --> 00:03:33.909
You really do miss me.

72
00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.345
Horton. it's Captain Kramer.

73
00:03:35.345 --> 00:03:37.521
Oh. um. sorry. Captain.

74
00:03:37.521 --> 00:03:39.044
I-I-I--I thought
that you were Joe.

75
00:03:39.044 --> 00:03:40.742
How can I help you?

76
00:03:40.742 --> 00:03:42.396
I have a meta in need
of your legal services.

77
00:03:42.396 --> 00:03:44.093
I know it's on short notice.

78
00:03:44.093 --> 00:03:45.660
but is there any way
you could come down to CCPD?

79
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.792
Yeah. of course.
It's what I do.

80
00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:49.446
I'm on my way.

81
00:03:51.187 --> 00:03:52.667
You guys are gonna
have a blast in Coast City.

82
00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:54.190
especially at the CCC Media
expansion party.

83
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.452
Hey. not too much
of a blast. though.

84
00:03:55.452 --> 00:03:56.975
Remember?
You're zooping for three

85
00:03:56.975 --> 00:03:58.586
now that Iris is pregnant.
- No. no. no.

86
00:03:58.586 --> 00:04:00.675
We've adopted
a no zooping policy

87
00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:02.024
during the pregnancy.

88
00:04:02.024 --> 00:04:03.068
The drive to Coast City's
gonna be

89
00:04:03.068 --> 00:04:04.679
beautiful this time of year.

90
00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:06.289
especially 'cause
we're having an early spring.

91
00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:07.682
Well. we should hit the road
so we make it

92
00:04:07.682 --> 00:04:10.206
in time for our beachside
couple's massage.

93
00:04:11.773 --> 00:04:12.861
It's a baby moon thing.

94
00:04:12.861 --> 00:04:14.210
Don't worry about it. okay?

95
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.298
Just call us
if you need anything.

96
00:04:15.298 --> 00:04:17.126
All right?
both: Bye.

97
00:04:17.126 --> 00:04:19.215
Bye.

98
00:04:23.045 --> 00:04:25.569
It's my stupid landlord.

99
00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:27.571
I haven't had hot water
for days. and now he says

100
00:04:27.571 --> 00:04:29.791
that they can't fix it
until next week.

101
00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:31.532
I hate that place.

102
00:04:31.532 --> 00:04:34.448
Uh. I could come over
and look at it for you.

103
00:04:34.448 --> 00:04:36.885
- Oh. yeah?
- Yeah.

104
00:04:36.885 --> 00:04:39.191
Wait. is this. like.
a boyfriend thing?

105
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:41.368
I mean.
maybe a little bit. yeah.

106
00:04:42.891 --> 00:04:44.806
You guys are so cute.
I'm so happy for you.

107
00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:49.201
I'm gonna get you
a congratulatory sapling.

108
00:04:49.201 --> 00:04:51.856
Hey. wait. wait. wait.

109
00:04:51.856 --> 00:04:55.686
Are we seriously not gonna
acknowledge your new powers?

110
00:04:55.686 --> 00:04:58.123
Khione was the first person
to know about Iris' pregnancy.

111
00:04:58.123 --> 00:04:59.951
I mean. not even Iris.

112
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:02.171
And now. she's able to predict
an early spring?

113
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:04.478
Look. all I'm saying

114
00:05:04.478 --> 00:05:06.436
is that you were born
under unique circumstances.

115
00:05:06.436 --> 00:05:09.526
and there is a lot
we don't know about you.

116
00:05:09.526 --> 00:05:11.093
That is true.

117
00:05:11.093 --> 00:05:12.790
So what do you say
we use this time

118
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.490
to help you find out
what those abilities might be?

119
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.492
Chester?

120
00:05:18.492 --> 00:05:19.754
Want to give me a hand?

121
00:05:21.973 --> 00:05:25.368
Abso-definitely!
Let's make some schmience.

122
00:05:25.368 --> 00:05:28.371
Yeah. and I am gonna give
my landlord a piece of my mind.

123
00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:30.591
Where do we begin?

124
00:05:32.723 --> 00:05:35.030
Sharpe's a former
casino dealer who was arrested

125
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.815
for putting her fiancé.
Dom Stewart. in a coma.

126
00:05:37.815 --> 00:05:39.730
He's in stable condition
at CC General.

127
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.863
but now she's facing
an attempted murder charge.

128
00:05:41.863 --> 00:05:44.039
This looks like
an open-and-shut case.

129
00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:45.954
Captain. why call me?

130
00:05:45.954 --> 00:05:47.434
Sharpe's also a meta-human

131
00:05:47.434 --> 00:05:49.000
with the ability
to turn luck in her favor.

132
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.741
I remember.

133
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:53.396
Getting arrested for attempted
murder isn't very lucky.

134
00:05:53.396 --> 00:05:55.267
Which is another reason
why I think she's innocent.

135
00:05:55.267 --> 00:05:57.487
Another reason?
What's the first?

136
00:05:57.487 --> 00:05:58.967
The crime scene
was too perfect.

137
00:05:58.967 --> 00:06:01.404
and an anonymous tip
was called in.

138
00:06:01.404 --> 00:06:02.797
Call it a gut instinct.

139
00:06:02.797 --> 00:06:05.582
but I think
someone's setting her up.

140
00:06:05.582 --> 00:06:07.932
Joe used to have
those feelings all the time.

141
00:06:07.932 --> 00:06:09.281
He was never wrong.

142
00:06:10.805 --> 00:06:12.328
Let's just start
with the facts.

143
00:06:12.328 --> 00:06:14.809
Uh. does Dominic
have any enemies?

144
00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:16.941
Just dairy.

145
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:18.290
Oh.

146
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.814
Dom's a really good guy.

147
00:06:19.814 --> 00:06:21.511
And he is your boyfriend?

148
00:06:21.511 --> 00:06:23.295
- My fiancé.
- Fiancé.

149
00:06:23.295 --> 00:06:25.297
Dom is the love of my life.

150
00:06:25.297 --> 00:06:28.475
I swear if I could
take his place in that coma.

151
00:06:28.475 --> 00:06:30.868
I would in a heartbeat.

152
00:06:30.868 --> 00:06:32.609
Please. Ms. Horton. I--

153
00:06:32.609 --> 00:06:34.698
I know how bad this all looks.

154
00:06:34.698 --> 00:06:37.048
but I-I didn't do this.

155
00:06:37.048 --> 00:06:39.050
That's why you--
you have to help me.

156
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.923
Otherwise. I-I don't know
what's gonna happen.

157
00:06:41.923 --> 00:06:44.012
Okay. Becky.

158
00:06:44.012 --> 00:06:45.448
I believe you.
- Oh.

159
00:06:45.448 --> 00:06:47.058
- And I'm gonna take your case.
- Oh.

160
00:06:47.058 --> 00:06:49.234
Okay?
Let's start on Monday.

161
00:06:49.234 --> 00:06:50.888
Oh. oh. wait! Monday?

162
00:06:50.888 --> 00:06:53.195
No. no. no. no. no!
You need to start now!

163
00:06:53.195 --> 00:06:54.892
They're gonna put me in jail!

164
00:06:54.892 --> 00:06:57.199
I wouldn't last a week in here.

165
00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:59.723
Becky. Becky. you're not
gonna go to jail. okay?

166
00:06:59.723 --> 00:07:01.595
All of the evidence against you
is circumstantial.

167
00:07:01.595 --> 00:07:04.989
At worst. you'll spend the
weekend here in a holding cell.

168
00:07:04.989 --> 00:07:07.078
Oh. okay. - Everything is going

169
00:07:07.078 --> 00:07:08.993
to be fine. I promise.

170
00:07:08.993 --> 00:07:11.692
- Okay.
- I'm not so sure about that.

171
00:07:11.692 --> 00:07:13.476
They just found the weapon.

172
00:07:13.476 --> 00:07:15.957
Things just got a lot worse.

173
00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:24.618
Seriously?

174
00:07:30.145 --> 00:07:31.886
So aren't you supposed to be
on a train in. like. six hours?

175
00:07:31.886 --> 00:07:36.194
Yes. I am.
so we need to make this fast.

176
00:07:36.194 --> 00:07:39.241
Is there a plunger out there?

177
00:07:39.241 --> 00:07:42.287
I don't know. Becky.

178
00:07:42.287 --> 00:07:45.290
Didn't Barry say she died.
like. five years ago?

179
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:46.770
Yeah. she did.

180
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.642
but when Crisis reset
the world.

181
00:07:48.642 --> 00:07:50.295
Becky got lucky.

182
00:07:50.295 --> 00:07:52.080
She came back.

183
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.651
Oh... sorry about the smell.

184
00:07:57.651 --> 00:07:59.435
both: Yeah.

185
00:07:59.435 --> 00:08:02.569
Okay. Becky.
so when you found Dom.

186
00:08:02.569 --> 00:08:05.006
neither you nor the police
saw any evidence

187
00:08:05.006 --> 00:08:06.181
that someone else
had been here?

188
00:08:06.181 --> 00:08:07.487
- No.
- Okay.

189
00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:09.793
well. we're not the police.

190
00:08:09.793 --> 00:08:13.841
Oh. so you think the person
that attacked him

191
00:08:13.841 --> 00:08:17.366
did leave something behind
and that you can find it?

192
00:08:17.366 --> 00:08:19.281
Yep. that's the idea.

193
00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:21.892
Close the curtains?
- On it.

194
00:08:29.291 --> 00:08:30.727
Huh.

195
00:08:30.727 --> 00:08:32.599
Well. whoever attacked
your fiancé

196
00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:34.688
really cleaned up their trail.

197
00:08:38.648 --> 00:08:40.476
Huh.

198
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.480
Curtain.

199
00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:48.005
Okay. well. I--I found these.

200
00:08:48.005 --> 00:08:49.746
They look like
they have DNA on them.

201
00:08:49.746 --> 00:08:52.183
Oh. I've actually
been looking for this.

202
00:08:54.316 --> 00:08:55.970
A poker chip.

203
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:58.189
Becky. have you been
working the casinos again?

204
00:08:58.189 --> 00:09:00.627
- Not anymore.
- Maybe it's Dominic's?

205
00:09:00.627 --> 00:09:02.106
Oh. no.
I mean.

206
00:09:02.106 --> 00:09:04.065
Dominic wouldn't even jaywalk.

207
00:09:04.065 --> 00:09:05.719
let alone gamble.

208
00:09:05.719 --> 00:09:08.765
Well. if it isn't yours
and it isn't his...

209
00:09:08.765 --> 00:09:11.159
Then it might belong
to the person who did this.

210
00:09:11.159 --> 00:09:13.378
which means we need to figure
out where this chip came from.

211
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.035
Becky.

212
00:09:18.035 --> 00:09:20.124
Something you want to tell me?

213
00:09:20.124 --> 00:09:24.085
Well. there is someone who
gambles and who's here a lot.

214
00:09:24.085 --> 00:09:26.740
but--but he could never
have done this.

215
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.176
Why not?

216
00:09:28.176 --> 00:09:31.614
Because he's my future
brother-in-law.

217
00:09:31.614 --> 00:09:35.487
What kind of scum would
do this to my baby brother?

218
00:09:35.487 --> 00:09:37.707
Tony. I am so sorry that
you have to go through this.

219
00:09:37.707 --> 00:09:39.579
but if we're gonna figure out
what happened.

220
00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.363
we need your help.

221
00:09:41.363 --> 00:09:43.670
Now can you tell us about
the last time you saw brother?

222
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:47.674
It was last week.

223
00:09:47.674 --> 00:09:49.632
I was tagging along with Dom

224
00:09:49.632 --> 00:09:52.287
to pick up that beautiful ring
of yours. Becky.

225
00:09:52.287 --> 00:09:55.246
I was his best man.
Still am.

226
00:09:55.246 --> 00:09:59.903
We've been inseparable our--
our whole lives.

227
00:09:59.903 --> 00:10:03.037
And the one time that
I'm not there. this happens.

228
00:10:05.126 --> 00:10:07.084
It's my fault.

229
00:10:07.084 --> 00:10:08.346
Oh no. wait!
That's my favorite...

230
00:10:10.914 --> 00:10:12.176
Scarf.

231
00:10:12.176 --> 00:10:13.395
Oh.

232
00:10:13.395 --> 00:10:15.615
Tony.
Any idea why this

233
00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:17.617
would be in Dom's apartment?

234
00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:21.055
Tony.

235
00:10:22.665 --> 00:10:26.538
You just got real anxious
all of a sudden.

236
00:10:26.538 --> 00:10:31.021
If this means something.
you need to fill us in.

237
00:10:31.021 --> 00:10:34.546
I'm so sorry. Becky.

238
00:10:34.546 --> 00:10:37.332
Dom didn't want you
to find out.

239
00:10:37.332 --> 00:10:40.640
but as much as he loved you...

240
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.077
he loved the roulette wheel.

241
00:10:43.077 --> 00:10:44.818
And the slots

242
00:10:44.818 --> 00:10:48.299
and the dice as well.
now that I think about it.

243
00:10:48.299 --> 00:10:50.171
Dom was a gambler?

244
00:10:50.171 --> 00:10:52.434
He was <i>the</i> gambler.

245
00:10:52.434 --> 00:10:54.697
Only thing missing
was a roasted chicken.

246
00:10:54.697 --> 00:10:56.786
No. no.

247
00:10:56.786 --> 00:10:59.006
Dom wouldn't hide
something like that from me.

248
00:10:59.006 --> 00:11:03.271
He made me promise
not to tell you.

249
00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:06.491
He was in a lot of debt.
- To who?

250
00:11:06.491 --> 00:11:08.058
They might be the ones
who are behind this.

251
00:11:08.058 --> 00:11:10.017
I don't know.

252
00:11:10.017 --> 00:11:14.151
But from what Dom told me.
they weren't a very...

253
00:11:14.151 --> 00:11:15.892
friendly bunch.

254
00:11:15.892 --> 00:11:18.460
Whoever Dom owed money to
must've come to collect.

255
00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.245
But Dom couldn't pay up.
Sounds like motive to me.

256
00:11:21.245 --> 00:11:22.812
What are we gonna do?

257
00:11:22.812 --> 00:11:25.554
If Dom owes money to the mob...

258
00:11:25.554 --> 00:11:28.339
Look. Tony. if I'm gonna
prove Becky's innocence.

259
00:11:28.339 --> 00:11:29.689
then we need your help.

260
00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:32.648
You knew what was going on
with Dom.

261
00:11:32.648 --> 00:11:36.043
Any idea where this came from?

262
00:11:36.043 --> 00:11:38.785
O'Shaughnessy's Bar.

263
00:11:38.785 --> 00:11:42.049
They run a high-stakes
casino night twice a month.

264
00:11:42.049 --> 00:11:43.659
Dom was a regular.

265
00:11:43.659 --> 00:11:46.706
Okay.
That's where we go next.

266
00:11:53.538 --> 00:11:56.672
Okay. so bar manager has
no idea who Dom owes money to.

267
00:11:56.672 --> 00:11:58.456
but I don't know.
something about this.

268
00:11:58.456 --> 00:11:59.893
it just doesn't feel right.

269
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.853
No. no. no. no. no. no.

270
00:12:03.853 --> 00:12:05.594
I missed my call back
from Joe and Jenna.

271
00:12:05.594 --> 00:12:07.291
What am I gonna do. Allegra?

272
00:12:07.291 --> 00:12:09.032
I've got less than two hours
to make this train.

273
00:12:09.032 --> 00:12:10.164
Hang on. I'm sorry.
I just have to go make a call.

274
00:12:10.164 --> 00:12:11.731
What train?

275
00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:14.255
Uh. it's gonna be okay.
Just give me a sec.

276
00:12:14.255 --> 00:12:16.823
I know. it's all my fault.
I'm so sorry. Just trust me.

277
00:12:16.823 --> 00:12:18.433
It's entirely my fault.

278
00:12:18.433 --> 00:12:21.088
- Let's go. Becky.
- Wait! Who are you guys?

279
00:12:21.088 --> 00:12:23.003
Hey. bozos!

280
00:12:23.003 --> 00:12:24.918
My client's not going anywhere
with you.

281
00:12:24.918 --> 00:12:28.225
Now back off...
before I make you back off.

282
00:12:47.984 --> 00:12:49.856
Uh. Cecile?

283
00:12:53.729 --> 00:12:55.687
Oh. my gosh!

284
00:12:55.687 --> 00:12:58.690
My bad luck is rubbing off
on you now. too!

285
00:12:59.996 --> 00:13:01.476
You were saying?

286
00:13:07.612 --> 00:13:09.571
Wait. wait!
Please!

287
00:13:09.571 --> 00:13:12.356
I'll go quietly.
and if Dom owes you money.

288
00:13:12.356 --> 00:13:15.882
I will find a way
to pay you back. I swear.

289
00:13:15.882 --> 00:13:17.535
Get up.

290
00:13:17.535 --> 00:13:19.233
You're embarrassing yourself.

291
00:13:19.233 --> 00:13:21.496
If you insist.

292
00:13:21.496 --> 00:13:22.584
Uh!

293
00:13:24.107 --> 00:13:26.240
Ooh. ooh. that stings.

294
00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.856
Nice moves.

295
00:13:33.856 --> 00:13:35.771
I mean. you too.

296
00:13:35.771 --> 00:13:38.208
but how come your powers
aren't all wonky like hers?

297
00:13:38.208 --> 00:13:40.297
First. Becky.
who were those guys?

298
00:13:40.297 --> 00:13:42.996
I don't know. I've never
seen them before in my life.

299
00:13:42.996 --> 00:13:44.388
What's going on out here?

300
00:13:44.388 --> 00:13:46.869
Any more tricks.
I start firing.

301
00:13:46.869 --> 00:13:48.392
I hate this job.

302
00:13:48.392 --> 00:13:49.698
Got yourself
some meta-muscle?

303
00:13:49.698 --> 00:13:51.613
Fine. you won this round.

304
00:13:51.613 --> 00:13:53.484
Follow us and he dies.

305
00:13:53.484 --> 00:13:55.008
No. don't.

306
00:13:57.662 --> 00:13:59.360
Hey. Are you okay?

307
00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.622
Yeah.

308
00:14:02.406 --> 00:14:04.800
This is all my fault.

309
00:14:07.542 --> 00:14:10.501
All right. party people.

310
00:14:10.501 --> 00:14:13.548
So I have retrofitted
our combat dummy

311
00:14:13.548 --> 00:14:17.944
to test for over 56
different power sets.

312
00:14:17.944 --> 00:14:21.295
I'm talking pyrokinesis. telekinesis.

313
00:14:21.295 --> 00:14:23.514
technopathy--
- Cryokinesis?

314
00:14:23.514 --> 00:14:25.995
Oh. does Mr. Freeze take
his root beer on the rocks?

315
00:14:25.995 --> 00:14:27.954
I mean. obvious--Khione. right?

316
00:14:27.954 --> 00:14:31.827
So. uh. yeah.
it tests for ice powers. too.

317
00:14:33.437 --> 00:14:35.265
What if I don't
have any powers?

318
00:14:35.265 --> 00:14:36.963
Uh. except you do.

319
00:14:36.963 --> 00:14:39.922
I know it because it's
the only reason I'm alive.

320
00:14:39.922 --> 00:14:42.185
And Khione. I read
Gideon's medical analysis

321
00:14:42.185 --> 00:14:44.187
of my condition
during the coma.

322
00:14:44.187 --> 00:14:45.885
I shouldn't even be here.

323
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:48.496
And that beating I took.
my insides were a mess.

324
00:14:48.496 --> 00:14:50.150
My vitals were--were crashing.

325
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.805
It's true.
Mark is lucky to be alive.

326
00:14:53.805 --> 00:14:55.329
So don't you see?

327
00:14:55.329 --> 00:14:57.548
I was a goner.
but then you kissed me.

328
00:14:57.548 --> 00:14:59.115
Say what?

329
00:14:59.115 --> 00:15:01.378
And my biometrics regulated.
I woke up.

330
00:15:01.378 --> 00:15:03.772
It--it was a miracle.

331
00:15:03.772 --> 00:15:06.209
But not the cosmic karma kind.

332
00:15:06.209 --> 00:15:08.255
It was you. Khione.

333
00:15:08.255 --> 00:15:12.607
And so that means you must have
some kind of meta-abilities.

334
00:15:12.607 --> 00:15:14.304
I just don't feel like I do.

335
00:15:14.304 --> 00:15:17.438
Actually. uh.
you having meta-powers

336
00:15:17.438 --> 00:15:20.963
is the only scientific
explanation for what happened.

337
00:15:20.963 --> 00:15:24.488
which is why I think
it's worth investigating.

338
00:15:24.488 --> 00:15:27.883
If you say so. Okay.

339
00:15:27.883 --> 00:15:30.146
Let's see what fruits
I can bear.

340
00:15:30.146 --> 00:15:32.322
Let's start off
with an ice blast. shall we?

341
00:15:32.322 --> 00:15:34.934
Now...

342
00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:36.370
you're gonna want
to have your feet

343
00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:37.937
approximately
shoulder width apart.

344
00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:41.288
line up with your target.
and then breathe...

345
00:15:44.247 --> 00:15:46.249
And fire.

346
00:15:53.039 --> 00:15:54.388
Give it a try.

347
00:15:54.388 --> 00:15:55.693
All righty. then.

348
00:15:57.347 --> 00:15:59.480
Oh.
Yeah. watch your feet. yeah.

349
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.700
Good stance.
Line up that target.

350
00:16:05.138 --> 00:16:07.096
Perfect.

351
00:16:07.096 --> 00:16:08.402
Lean in.

352
00:16:09.881 --> 00:16:12.710
And then...

353
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:13.755
breathe.

354
00:16:15.191 --> 00:16:18.020
Release that feeling
inside of you--

355
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.718
whenever you're ready--

356
00:16:20.718 --> 00:16:22.633
simply by letting go.

357
00:16:28.813 --> 00:16:29.901
Um...

358
00:16:29.901 --> 00:16:31.294
Maybe. um. just try

359
00:16:31.294 --> 00:16:33.253
focusing harder this time.

360
00:16:34.906 --> 00:16:36.299
Ice blast. activate!

361
00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:40.260
Go. ice. go!

362
00:16:43.393 --> 00:16:45.308
I don't feel anything.

363
00:16:45.308 --> 00:16:48.137
There are no fluctuations
in her core temperature

364
00:16:48.137 --> 00:16:51.140
or surges
in dark matter readings.

365
00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:55.710
Okay. well.
then I suppose we try again.

366
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:57.364
Okay.

367
00:17:02.064 --> 00:17:03.413
Here?

368
00:17:03.413 --> 00:17:04.675
Yeah.
One more time.

369
00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:08.897
What if I try my left hand?

370
00:17:21.779 --> 00:17:23.520
Guys. I don't think
this is working.

371
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.957
Yeah. dude.
Why don't we just move on?

372
00:17:25.957 --> 00:17:27.568
I don't think
she has ice powers.

373
00:17:27.568 --> 00:17:28.743
Well. then you're wrong.

374
00:17:28.743 --> 00:17:31.746
Or at least your readings are.

375
00:17:31.746 --> 00:17:33.182
And you need to focus more.

376
00:17:33.182 --> 00:17:35.445
Actually. I'm always focused.

377
00:17:35.445 --> 00:17:37.708
I just don't have ice powers.
and that's okay.

378
00:17:37.708 --> 00:17:39.058
No. it isn't!

379
00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:40.581
Mark. what's wrong?

380
00:17:40.581 --> 00:17:42.104
"What's wrong?"

381
00:17:42.104 --> 00:17:44.759
What's wrong is you--

382
00:17:48.154 --> 00:17:49.459
I'm sorry.

383
00:17:51.157 --> 00:17:53.420
I'm sorry.
I--I need a minute.

384
00:17:58.816 --> 00:18:02.516
Oh. this is bad.
This is really bad.

385
00:18:02.516 --> 00:18:04.605
Don't worry.
We will keep you safe.

386
00:18:04.605 --> 00:18:07.042
Okay. that doesn't help Dom.

387
00:18:07.042 --> 00:18:09.479
I mean. he might die
because of me.

388
00:18:09.479 --> 00:18:12.178
God. everything is just--
it's so screwed up!

389
00:18:12.178 --> 00:18:14.093
Okay. okay. look.
I have Dom's last five years

390
00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:15.268
of banking records right here.

391
00:18:15.268 --> 00:18:17.444
Now. whoever Dom owes money to.

392
00:18:17.444 --> 00:18:19.054
they might've
left a digital trail

393
00:18:19.054 --> 00:18:20.708
somewhere in here.

394
00:18:20.708 --> 00:18:23.624
so if I can just find one thing
that can help us.

395
00:18:23.624 --> 00:18:25.191
maybe we can close this case.

396
00:18:25.191 --> 00:18:26.627
What about this right--

397
00:18:26.627 --> 00:18:27.715
all: Oh!

398
00:18:27.715 --> 00:18:29.412
Oh. no.

399
00:18:29.412 --> 00:18:31.936
Oh. those are your only copies.
aren't they?

400
00:18:31.936 --> 00:18:33.677
Uh. hey. Becky?

401
00:18:33.677 --> 00:18:35.288
There are some paper towels
in the break room

402
00:18:35.288 --> 00:18:36.463
just down the hall.

403
00:18:36.463 --> 00:18:38.334
Do you mind?
- Okay.

404
00:18:40.467 --> 00:18:43.252
Okay. well. uh.
could this get any worse?

405
00:18:47.517 --> 00:18:50.041
It's 8:07.

406
00:18:50.041 --> 00:18:54.089
I missed my train.
I missed my train!

407
00:18:54.089 --> 00:18:56.613
Oh!
How did this happen?

408
00:18:56.613 --> 00:18:58.615
I-it's okay.
Uh. you--you can take

409
00:18:58.615 --> 00:19:00.748
the morning train.
be there by lunch. easy-peasy.

410
00:19:00.748 --> 00:19:03.054
No. no. it's not easy-peasy.
I can't.

411
00:19:03.054 --> 00:19:05.318
I'm gonna miss Jenna's
breakfast in the morning.

412
00:19:05.318 --> 00:19:08.016
It's her birthday breakfast.
I make it every year.

413
00:19:08.016 --> 00:19:09.713
And now. I have ruined
our new tradition

414
00:19:09.713 --> 00:19:12.716
because I needed to be there
by tonight.

415
00:19:12.716 --> 00:19:14.327
Oh. why did I take this case?

416
00:19:14.327 --> 00:19:17.330
This woman has been bad luck
from the start!

417
00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:18.331
Um...

418
00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:26.034
You're. um.
out of paper towels.

419
00:19:26.034 --> 00:19:28.819
Becky. I'm so sorry.
I-I-I didn't mean it.

420
00:19:28.819 --> 00:19:34.521
No. No. you're
absolutely right. Cecile.

421
00:19:34.521 --> 00:19:38.960
Lately. every life that
I've touched has been ruined.

422
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.093
including Dom's.

423
00:19:42.093 --> 00:19:44.705
He just never should've
proposed to me.

424
00:19:44.705 --> 00:19:48.317
I've always just been bad news.

425
00:19:48.317 --> 00:19:52.495
and I'm just finally
getting what I deserve.

426
00:19:52.495 --> 00:19:55.846
So--

427
00:19:55.846 --> 00:19:58.109
- I'll--I'll talk to her.
- No. no. no. no.

428
00:19:58.109 --> 00:20:00.677
I'll go.
I just need to explain

429
00:20:00.677 --> 00:20:01.765
that none of this is her--
- No!

430
00:20:03.593 --> 00:20:05.291
No. no!
Help!

431
00:20:07.336 --> 00:20:09.251
- Hey!
- Let her go!

432
00:20:30.881 --> 00:20:32.405
Oh. crap.

433
00:20:48.986 --> 00:20:50.553
Okay. so I've tapped
into the S.T.A.R. Labs

434
00:20:50.553 --> 00:20:52.381
remote satellite feed.

435
00:20:52.381 --> 00:20:54.862
There's no sign
of Becky anywhere.

436
00:20:54.862 --> 00:20:57.168
Well. Cecile.
what about your empath power?

437
00:20:57.168 --> 00:20:59.562
She's probably terrified.
- Hey. right. right.

438
00:20:59.562 --> 00:21:01.260
Cecile. if you could
hone in on--

439
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.088
I can't.
I tried ten minutes ago.

440
00:21:04.088 --> 00:21:05.960
My powers still aren't
working properly.

441
00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.659
Uh. but Becky's not around.
They--they should be.

442
00:21:09.659 --> 00:21:12.358
They're not.
because I am apparently failing

443
00:21:12.358 --> 00:21:14.621
as a superhero
as well as a mom.

444
00:21:17.232 --> 00:21:18.755
I need to go call Jenna.

445
00:21:20.975 --> 00:21:22.411
I-I--

446
00:21:24.674 --> 00:21:26.807
Chuck. this is not
all her fault.

447
00:21:26.807 --> 00:21:29.026
I mean. it was my powers
that blinded me

448
00:21:29.026 --> 00:21:30.680
and let Becky get kidnapped.

449
00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.988
And your powers backfired when...

450
00:21:33.988 --> 00:21:36.469
one of them flashed
this puppy at you?

451
00:21:36.469 --> 00:21:37.470
Yeah.

452
00:21:39.036 --> 00:21:42.475
Okay. uh. I'm gonna
take this back to my workshop.

453
00:21:42.475 --> 00:21:44.694
I've got a hunch.

454
00:21:44.694 --> 00:21:47.480
Okay.
Um. I'll talk to Cecile.

455
00:22:17.814 --> 00:22:19.468
<i>I thought
I'd find you in here.</i>

456
00:22:21.122 --> 00:22:23.951
Mark. why are you so angry?

457
00:22:26.083 --> 00:22:28.912
Why did you kiss me?

458
00:22:28.912 --> 00:22:30.218
I don't know.
I just--

459
00:22:30.218 --> 00:22:31.611
I thought
that's what you needed.

460
00:22:31.611 --> 00:22:33.047
Yeah?

461
00:22:33.047 --> 00:22:34.527
And what did you think
was gonna happen?

462
00:22:34.527 --> 00:22:36.790
Nothing.
I just wanted you to wake up.

463
00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:38.095
It was nothing. really.

464
00:22:38.095 --> 00:22:40.402
Except it is.

465
00:22:40.402 --> 00:22:42.230
Look. I'm sorry. but next time.

466
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.711
maybe try smelling salts
or--or blaring Metallica.

467
00:22:44.711 --> 00:22:46.756
Anything.

468
00:22:46.756 --> 00:22:48.105
Don't kiss me again.

469
00:22:48.105 --> 00:22:50.804
Was it bad?
Am I a bad kisser?

470
00:22:50.804 --> 00:22:52.893
No. it wasn't bad at all.

471
00:22:52.893 --> 00:22:54.677
It--

472
00:22:54.677 --> 00:22:57.245
that's beside the point.

473
00:22:57.245 --> 00:22:59.813
It's just the last time that
somebody kissed me like that.

474
00:22:59.813 --> 00:23:01.771
I--I--

475
00:23:01.771 --> 00:23:04.644
It was Frost. wasn't it?

476
00:23:04.644 --> 00:23:08.299
Did you know I was
in love with her?

477
00:23:08.299 --> 00:23:10.563
That I never got to tell her.
and now it's too late?

478
00:23:13.087 --> 00:23:15.219
There it is.

479
00:23:15.219 --> 00:23:17.700
And so when you kissed me...

480
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.225
the briefest moment
before I opened my eyes.

481
00:23:21.225 --> 00:23:24.141
it was like she was alive.

482
00:23:24.141 --> 00:23:28.189
It was like I actually got
a second chance.

483
00:23:28.189 --> 00:23:31.540
And then...

484
00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:35.196
when I realized it wasn't her.

485
00:23:35.196 --> 00:23:37.328
it was like she died
all over again.

486
00:23:37.328 --> 00:23:40.636
And that is why you have
to have her powers.

487
00:23:43.813 --> 00:23:46.076
It's all that's left of her.

488
00:23:46.076 --> 00:23:49.079
Mark. no.
It's not.

489
00:23:49.079 --> 00:23:51.560
And I don't have
Frost's powers.

490
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.867
Are you sure?

491
00:23:53.867 --> 00:23:56.870
'Cause that kiss...

492
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:58.654
that kiss had some power
over me.

493
00:24:07.924 --> 00:24:11.101
Did you know that in Utah.
there are these rock formations

494
00:24:11.101 --> 00:24:16.280
where gorgeous wildflowers grow
inside certain canyon walls?

495
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.978
What does that have to do
with Frost?

496
00:24:17.978 --> 00:24:20.589
These canyons were eroded
over centuries of time

497
00:24:20.589 --> 00:24:23.462
by a river that's
no longer there.

498
00:24:23.462 --> 00:24:26.203
And it left behind
this beautiful life

499
00:24:26.203 --> 00:24:29.424
so we could all enjoy
these beautiful blossoms.

500
00:24:31.208 --> 00:24:33.515
Mark. there is more of Frost
left behind in you

501
00:24:33.515 --> 00:24:35.996
than there ever was in me.

502
00:24:35.996 --> 00:24:39.347
I know she's gone.
but those memories.

503
00:24:39.347 --> 00:24:41.697
they're still there.

504
00:24:41.697 --> 00:24:46.049
and they are a beautiful part
of what's inside of you.

505
00:24:46.049 --> 00:24:50.140
And if you let them.
they'll just keep blossoming.

506
00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.881
Just like those wildflowers.

507
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.964
Yes! Honey. of course
I know that it's your birthday.

508
00:25:30.964 --> 00:25:33.532
And I'm gonna be there
tomorrow. I promise.

509
00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:35.098
I am.

510
00:25:35.098 --> 00:25:36.360
Yeah.

511
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.842
Okay.
Mama loves you. Jenna.

512
00:25:39.842 --> 00:25:42.149
Okay.

513
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:44.238
Mm-hmm.
Night-night.

514
00:25:47.328 --> 00:25:50.766
Hey.

515
00:25:50.766 --> 00:25:52.333
How'd she take it?

516
00:25:55.162 --> 00:25:57.860
Like a heartbroken
five-year-old.

517
00:26:00.602 --> 00:26:03.649
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

518
00:26:06.869 --> 00:26:09.959
Cecile. I. um.

519
00:26:09.959 --> 00:26:13.484
I found the pillow and sheets.

520
00:26:13.484 --> 00:26:17.097
How long have you been
sleeping in your office?

521
00:26:17.097 --> 00:26:20.143
Since the night
that Joe and Jenna left.

522
00:26:20.143 --> 00:26:24.887
It's just that the house
is so quiet now.

523
00:26:24.887 --> 00:26:27.411
and I miss them so much.

524
00:26:29.109 --> 00:26:31.372
Ugh.

525
00:26:31.372 --> 00:26:33.504
You know. when I told Jenna
that I was staying behind

526
00:26:33.504 --> 00:26:38.379
because I was helping people
and because I am a superhero.

527
00:26:38.379 --> 00:26:40.076
she was so proud

528
00:26:40.076 --> 00:26:43.906
and I told her that I would
always be her mom first.

529
00:26:46.735 --> 00:26:49.912
And now I feel like maybe
I can't do this.

530
00:26:49.912 --> 00:26:51.914
Well. I thought
you went home every weekend.

531
00:26:51.914 --> 00:26:53.133
I do.

532
00:26:53.133 --> 00:26:56.571
Yeah. but I...

533
00:26:56.571 --> 00:26:59.008
I don't think it's enough.

534
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:03.230
So basically. I have ruined
two lives tonight.

535
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:04.927
Becky's and Jenna's.

536
00:27:04.927 --> 00:27:10.803
and it's all because
I can't handle being alone.

537
00:27:10.803 --> 00:27:14.807
Maybe you move home
full-time?

538
00:27:14.807 --> 00:27:18.288
Yeah. I know.
but if I do that.

539
00:27:18.288 --> 00:27:20.029
then I can't help
as many people.

540
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:23.903
But if I stay. then my daughter

541
00:27:23.903 --> 00:27:26.557
is gonna stop thinking
of me as her mom

542
00:27:26.557 --> 00:27:29.212
and just think of me
as some relative

543
00:27:29.212 --> 00:27:30.866
who visits on the weekends.

544
00:27:30.866 --> 00:27:33.956
Cecile. no.

545
00:27:35.262 --> 00:27:37.394
Even when you're
fighting big bads.

546
00:27:37.394 --> 00:27:41.268
the love you have for Jenna
is still there.

547
00:27:41.268 --> 00:27:45.228
And--and the things
that you're doing now.

548
00:27:45.228 --> 00:27:47.535
they're just--
they're just showing her

549
00:27:47.535 --> 00:27:51.147
how to become an incredible
woman like you one day.

550
00:27:51.147 --> 00:27:54.890
You're a superwoman. Cecile.

551
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.284
And from where I'm sitting.

552
00:27:57.284 --> 00:27:59.416
that makes Jenna
the luckiest kid in the world.

553
00:28:02.768 --> 00:28:04.030
Yeah?

554
00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:06.206
Yeah.

555
00:28:07.816 --> 00:28:11.037
When did you become so wise?

556
00:28:11.037 --> 00:28:14.562
I have my moments.

557
00:28:14.562 --> 00:28:17.130
Thank you.
- Yeah.

558
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:18.479
Thank you.

559
00:28:20.133 --> 00:28:22.526
Oh.

560
00:28:22.526 --> 00:28:23.919
Oh. it's Chuck.

561
00:28:23.919 --> 00:28:25.486
He found something.

562
00:28:25.486 --> 00:28:27.270
<i>Well. it turns out
this crystal</i>

563
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:29.490
<i>is a dark matter refractor.</i>

564
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:31.971
Yeah. it uses
an asymmetric matrix

565
00:28:31.971 --> 00:28:35.017
to reverse any meta-ability
it comes in contact with.

566
00:28:35.017 --> 00:28:38.064
and that's why it deflected
Allegra's light blast.

567
00:28:38.064 --> 00:28:39.674
Chuck. you're amazing.

568
00:28:39.674 --> 00:28:41.415
H-how did you figure
all this out?

569
00:28:41.415 --> 00:28:43.722
Well. Goldface tried

570
00:28:43.722 --> 00:28:45.898
to sell me one
during the Rogue War.

571
00:28:45.898 --> 00:28:47.682
Yeah. he's trying to move them
on the black market.

572
00:28:47.682 --> 00:28:50.598
but it turns out the refractors
are one-time use only.

573
00:28:50.598 --> 00:28:52.382
so nobody's buying.

574
00:28:52.382 --> 00:28:54.384
Okay. first of all.
we're gonna shut down

575
00:28:54.384 --> 00:28:56.082
Goldface's operation
right after this.

576
00:28:56.082 --> 00:28:57.518
because not okay.

577
00:28:57.518 --> 00:28:59.563
Second.
this still doesn't explain

578
00:28:59.563 --> 00:29:02.131
why Becky's luck powers
are being reversed 24/7.

579
00:29:02.131 --> 00:29:04.307
Yeah. if these matrix things
only work once.

580
00:29:04.307 --> 00:29:05.656
someone would have
to follow her around

581
00:29:05.656 --> 00:29:07.615
with a new crystal
all the time.

582
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.226
both: Her engagement ring.

583
00:29:12.402 --> 00:29:14.491
And once a girl slips
that on her finger. baby.

584
00:29:14.491 --> 00:29:16.232
she is never taking it off.

585
00:29:16.232 --> 00:29:18.757
So until she does.
she'll have bad luck

586
00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:20.628
because it activated
when she put the ring on.

587
00:29:20.628 --> 00:29:22.195
and it'll keep working

588
00:29:22.195 --> 00:29:23.544
until she takes it off
for the first time.

589
00:29:23.544 --> 00:29:25.024
Wait. didn't Tony say

590
00:29:25.024 --> 00:29:26.634
he went ring shopping with Dom?

591
00:29:26.634 --> 00:29:29.028
Tony.
Tony. uh. yes.

592
00:29:29.028 --> 00:29:31.465
Chester. so. uh.
I'ma ask you to do something

593
00:29:31.465 --> 00:29:33.162
that is. eh. like.
a little bit shady.

594
00:29:33.162 --> 00:29:35.730
but Tony's bank records.
they would be confidential--

595
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:37.253
- Got 'em.
- Yes!

596
00:29:37.253 --> 00:29:40.082
Holy Casper Holstein.

597
00:29:40.082 --> 00:29:41.605
This guy is broke as a joke.

598
00:29:41.605 --> 00:29:43.694
Whoa.
that is way more than broke.

599
00:29:43.694 --> 00:29:46.872
Every account he's tied to
is in the negative.

600
00:29:46.872 --> 00:29:48.438
Well. it looks like
the last check that cleared

601
00:29:48.438 --> 00:29:51.137
was from Central City
Holdings and Assets.

602
00:29:51.137 --> 00:29:52.921
which is a company
that's suspected

603
00:29:52.921 --> 00:29:55.532
of having ties
with organized crime.

604
00:29:55.532 --> 00:29:58.057
Okay. so a broke guy

605
00:29:58.057 --> 00:30:00.755
who signs away his last
10 grand all in one chunk

606
00:30:00.755 --> 00:30:02.670
and to a shady institution?

607
00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:03.976
Yeah.
sounds like what happens

608
00:30:03.976 --> 00:30:05.586
when someone
has gambling debts.

609
00:30:05.586 --> 00:30:07.370
Man. if this guy owes money--

610
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:12.071
He would need. like.
a ton of money and fast.

611
00:30:12.071 --> 00:30:14.943
Kind of like...

612
00:30:14.943 --> 00:30:17.772
kind of like hitting
the jackpot at casino night.

613
00:30:17.772 --> 00:30:20.296
Allegra. come on.
It was right in front of us.

614
00:30:20.296 --> 00:30:23.038
Okay. how does Becky fit in?

615
00:30:23.038 --> 00:30:25.693
I bet when Tony found out
about her powers.

616
00:30:25.693 --> 00:30:27.738
he saw an out.

617
00:30:27.738 --> 00:30:30.829
Now he's gonna use her
to get rich.

618
00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:32.265
Not on our watch.

619
00:30:49.586 --> 00:30:51.806
Hey.
Blackjack.

620
00:30:53.286 --> 00:30:55.462
That's bad luck for the house.

621
00:30:55.462 --> 00:30:57.681
But good luck for me.

622
00:30:57.681 --> 00:31:00.075
Every time.

623
00:31:06.734 --> 00:31:09.955
You are up 50 grand. Tony.

624
00:31:09.955 --> 00:31:12.348
That is more than enough
to pay off your debts.

625
00:31:12.348 --> 00:31:14.524
Why don't you just walk
and let me go?

626
00:31:14.524 --> 00:31:17.788
And miss the opportunity
of a lifetime?

627
00:31:17.788 --> 00:31:19.965
Uh-uh.
Keep dealing.

628
00:31:28.756 --> 00:31:31.280
Blackjack again. Wow.

629
00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:34.675
Hell yeah.

630
00:31:34.675 --> 00:31:38.200
I told Dom one way or another.
you'd be helping me out.

631
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.115
He should've never tried
to stop me.

632
00:31:55.696 --> 00:31:57.045
Private game.

633
00:31:57.045 --> 00:31:58.133
Oh.

634
00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:04.400
Everything okay here?

635
00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.924
You bet.

636
00:32:08.013 --> 00:32:09.231
All right.

637
00:32:12.756 --> 00:32:16.369
Player has 20.
dealer has three.

638
00:32:20.808 --> 00:32:23.071
Split.

639
00:32:25.726 --> 00:32:27.728
Would you look at that?

640
00:32:27.728 --> 00:32:29.425
Double blackjack.

641
00:32:29.425 --> 00:32:30.644
Who saw that coming?

642
00:32:37.042 --> 00:32:39.044
Chuck. we're in.

643
00:32:39.044 --> 00:32:41.263
Okay.
Any sign of Becky yet?

644
00:32:41.263 --> 00:32:44.136
She's gotta be in there somewhere.

645
00:32:44.136 --> 00:32:45.920
Hell yeah!

646
00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.314
It's my night. people!

647
00:32:48.314 --> 00:32:50.838
Oh. yeah. she's here.
She's upstairs with Tony.

648
00:32:50.838 --> 00:32:52.318
<i>Okay. remember.
you just gotta</i>

649
00:32:52.318 --> 00:32:54.146
<i>get that engagement ring
off of her.</i>

650
00:32:54.146 --> 00:32:56.713
Okay. after that. her
meta-powers should do the rest.

651
00:32:56.713 --> 00:32:59.499
And tell me again
why I don't just use my powers

652
00:32:59.499 --> 00:33:01.457
to take this scumbag
to dreamtown?

653
00:33:01.457 --> 00:33:03.459
It's too close quarters
in there.

654
00:33:03.459 --> 00:33:04.939
<i>Someone else could get hurt.</i>

655
00:33:04.939 --> 00:33:06.636
<i>Plus. you could be ID'd
as a meta.</i>

656
00:33:06.636 --> 00:33:08.856
Okay. okay.
so I'm gonna take the stairs.

657
00:33:08.856 --> 00:33:11.511
Chester. you better have
that diversion ready.

658
00:33:11.511 --> 00:33:16.342
Actually. why don't you both
follow me to the buffet table?

659
00:33:16.342 --> 00:33:18.257
I hear the shrimp's to die for.

660
00:33:18.257 --> 00:33:20.607
Oh. I hate guns!

661
00:33:20.607 --> 00:33:23.523
Allegra. Cecile!
What's happening?

662
00:33:27.092 --> 00:33:28.658
Hungry?

663
00:33:28.658 --> 00:33:31.183
I'd eat if I were you.
Could be your last meal.

664
00:33:31.183 --> 00:33:33.141
No. no. no. no. no. no.

665
00:33:33.141 --> 00:33:34.360
No. No. no. no. no.

666
00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.622
What?

667
00:33:35.622 --> 00:33:37.145
Not a fan
of buffet chicken wings?

668
00:33:37.145 --> 00:33:39.582
- Mm-mm.
- You know what we really need?

669
00:33:39.582 --> 00:33:42.890
A distraction
from our current situation.

670
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:45.066
I'm overriding
the city power grid.

671
00:33:45.066 --> 00:33:47.416
<i>Almost there. almost there!
Five seconds.</i>

672
00:33:47.416 --> 00:33:49.375
- What are you two up to?
- Nothing.

673
00:33:49.375 --> 00:33:50.724
- No.
- No. nothing.

674
00:33:50.724 --> 00:33:51.986
We just--you know.
we were just. uh.

675
00:33:51.986 --> 00:33:53.248
hoping for a little change
of pace.

676
00:33:53.248 --> 00:33:55.903
Right now!
- Yes. I agree.

677
00:33:55.903 --> 00:33:57.818
One distraction
coming in three...

678
00:33:57.818 --> 00:33:59.602
No one's coming to save you.

679
00:33:59.602 --> 00:34:01.039
<i>- Two...</i>
- We don't need saving.

680
00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:02.605
<i>- One...</i>
- You do.

681
00:34:05.739 --> 00:34:06.957
What the hell?

682
00:34:06.957 --> 00:34:08.176
- Hup!
- Ugh!

683
00:34:08.176 --> 00:34:09.960
Get the ring!

684
00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.092
Ooh. nice!

685
00:34:15.792 --> 00:34:18.926
Get off of me. you asshat!

686
00:34:18.926 --> 00:34:21.320
Oh. here we are again.

687
00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.582
Becky with a gun against her.

688
00:34:22.582 --> 00:34:23.887
and you can't do anything
about it.

689
00:34:23.887 --> 00:34:25.889
Hey. dumbass.

690
00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:28.109
Never bet against a superwoman.

691
00:34:42.906 --> 00:34:45.213
Are you feeling lucky. punk?

692
00:34:45.213 --> 00:34:47.737
'Cause I know I am.

693
00:34:47.737 --> 00:34:50.653
Shoot 'em!
Shoot them all.

694
00:34:50.653 --> 00:34:52.873
<i>♪ Luck. be a lady ♪</i>

695
00:34:52.873 --> 00:34:54.918
Ouch.

696
00:34:56.964 --> 00:35:02.926
<i>♪ Luck. if you've ever
been a lady to begin with ♪</i>

697
00:35:02.926 --> 00:35:06.495
<i>♪ Luck. be a lady tonight ♪</i>

698
00:35:08.106 --> 00:35:09.716
Wait. is everyone okay?

699
00:35:09.716 --> 00:35:11.370
<i>♪ Luck. be a lady ♪</i>

700
00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:14.982
Yeah. we're fine.

701
00:35:14.982 --> 00:35:16.853
Call Kramer.

702
00:35:16.853 --> 00:35:18.942
She's got some dirty laundry
to pick up.

703
00:35:18.942 --> 00:35:21.162
Well. that was fun.

704
00:35:21.162 --> 00:35:26.559
I would say that
we are three badass bitches.

705
00:35:26.559 --> 00:35:29.214
And a whole lot more.

706
00:35:29.214 --> 00:35:30.650
all: Cheers.

707
00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:40.660
We do make one
damn good team. don't we?

708
00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:42.314
We do.

709
00:35:42.314 --> 00:35:44.011
You know. there's still
something I don't get.

710
00:35:44.011 --> 00:35:46.840
Your powers went haywire
at CCC Media.

711
00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.408
but were working
at O'Shaughnessy's.

712
00:35:49.408 --> 00:35:52.933
And Becky was in both places
and still had her ring on.

713
00:35:52.933 --> 00:35:55.544
so why didn't her
bad luck powers work on you?

714
00:35:55.544 --> 00:35:57.024
Because they never did.

715
00:35:57.024 --> 00:35:58.765
It's like what
you said earlier. Chuck.

716
00:35:58.765 --> 00:36:01.507
The matrix ring turned
Becky's bad luck onto herself.

717
00:36:01.507 --> 00:36:02.551
not others.

718
00:36:02.551 --> 00:36:04.205
Then why did Cecile--

719
00:36:04.205 --> 00:36:08.209
Because I wasn't myself.

720
00:36:08.209 --> 00:36:10.603
I was missing my family so bad.

721
00:36:10.603 --> 00:36:13.736
and I was sleeping on a couch
instead of in my own bed.

722
00:36:13.736 --> 00:36:15.608
I was up all night worrying

723
00:36:15.608 --> 00:36:19.829
that I wasn't being
a good enough mom to Jenna.

724
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:23.703
That's what
threw my powers off...

725
00:36:23.703 --> 00:36:25.444
until a good friend
set me straight.

726
00:36:25.444 --> 00:36:28.490
And she became
her usual badass self.

727
00:36:29.926 --> 00:36:31.928
Oh. and guess what?

728
00:36:31.928 --> 00:36:35.541
Now that Kramer has put Tony
on ice for Dom's attack.

729
00:36:35.541 --> 00:36:38.935
Becky can live happily
ever after with her beau.

730
00:36:38.935 --> 00:36:40.937
He woke up from his coma
last night.

731
00:36:40.937 --> 00:36:43.679
He's gonna be just fine.
- Yay.

732
00:36:45.159 --> 00:36:47.901
He's not the only one
feeling lucky.

733
00:36:47.901 --> 00:36:50.382
- Oh. really?
- Mm.

734
00:36:50.382 --> 00:36:51.948
Okay.

735
00:36:51.948 --> 00:36:54.342
- Oh. sorry.
- My bad.

736
00:36:54.342 --> 00:36:56.301
No worries.
Just get a room.

737
00:36:57.476 --> 00:37:02.698
Or actually... Allegra. stay.

738
00:37:02.698 --> 00:37:04.091
Not you. Chuck.
No offense.

739
00:37:04.091 --> 00:37:06.354
I'm just--
I'm not quite that chill.

740
00:37:06.354 --> 00:37:08.182
What do you mean?

741
00:37:08.182 --> 00:37:11.403
Well. I am done
sleeping at the office.

742
00:37:11.403 --> 00:37:14.536
but I mean. I could still
use some company

743
00:37:14.536 --> 00:37:16.451
in this big ol' empty house.

744
00:37:16.451 --> 00:37:20.629
and last I heard. you hate
your current residence.

745
00:37:20.629 --> 00:37:22.370
And I have a spare bedroom.

746
00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:24.633
Cecile. are you serious?

747
00:37:24.633 --> 00:37:26.287
You want me to move in
with you?

748
00:37:26.287 --> 00:37:27.462
Think about it. okay?

749
00:37:27.462 --> 00:37:29.812
My train leaves in an hour.

750
00:37:29.812 --> 00:37:31.336
and since I missed it
last night.

751
00:37:31.336 --> 00:37:33.163
I am gonna stay an extra day.

752
00:37:33.163 --> 00:37:36.515
which means you have a
three-day weekend to settle in.

753
00:37:36.515 --> 00:37:38.038
make yourself comfortable.

754
00:37:38.038 --> 00:37:40.345
Also.
my spare bedroom is bigger

755
00:37:40.345 --> 00:37:41.998
than your whole
entire apartment.

756
00:37:41.998 --> 00:37:44.697
Yeah. I'm--I'm sold.

757
00:37:44.697 --> 00:37:46.264
This is amazing.

758
00:37:46.264 --> 00:37:48.004
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

759
00:37:48.004 --> 00:37:51.051
Thank you so much.
You will not regret this.

760
00:37:51.051 --> 00:37:53.227
I know it.
I know it. roomie.

761
00:37:53.227 --> 00:37:55.403
Mm!

762
00:37:55.403 --> 00:37:57.362
- Okay. I'm gonna get my stuff.
- Okay.

763
00:38:03.716 --> 00:38:07.676
Uh-huh.
Houston. we have a banner.

764
00:38:07.676 --> 00:38:09.678
So most of my stuff
is unpacked.

765
00:38:09.678 --> 00:38:11.724
Do you want to come over
tonight and help me decorate?

766
00:38:11.724 --> 00:38:14.988
Ah. that's an affirmative. Captain.

767
00:38:14.988 --> 00:38:18.818
You guys are so sweet.

768
00:38:18.818 --> 00:38:20.602
Frost used to call celery
rabbit food.

769
00:38:20.602 --> 00:38:22.909
Mm. Then rabbits have
excellent taste.

770
00:38:25.433 --> 00:38:27.696
I bet she really
would've liked you.

771
00:38:27.696 --> 00:38:29.045
I hope so.

772
00:38:33.833 --> 00:38:35.269
They're coming.

773
00:38:35.269 --> 00:38:36.966
Hide! Hide!

774
00:38:46.585 --> 00:38:49.109
all: Surprise!

775
00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:53.026
Oh. wait. this is a--

776
00:38:53.026 --> 00:38:56.159
- Definitely a baby shower.
- Baby.

777
00:38:56.159 --> 00:39:00.120
Yeah. We figured no time
like the present. right?

778
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.252
Aw.

779
00:39:02.252 --> 00:39:04.037
Barry.

780
00:39:04.037 --> 00:39:05.995
It's finally starting
to hit me.

781
00:39:05.995 --> 00:39:07.606
Me too.

782
00:39:07.606 --> 00:39:09.695
Our Nora's gonna be here soon.

783
00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:16.876
Guys.
- You guys.

784
00:39:16.876 --> 00:39:18.399
- This is--
- Come here.

785
00:39:32.065 --> 00:39:34.067
So what's so important
it couldn't wait?

786
00:39:34.067 --> 00:39:37.200
Uh. so after Khione's little
snow dusting in the lounge.

787
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:41.422
I sent her test results
to Carla at Tannhauser Labs.

788
00:39:41.422 --> 00:39:44.556
Just wanted to confirm
my analysis.

789
00:39:44.556 --> 00:39:46.427
Why?
I'm sure it was accurate.

790
00:39:46.427 --> 00:39:48.037
You're a genius.
- Thanks.

791
00:39:48.037 --> 00:39:50.475
But. uh. well...

792
00:39:50.475 --> 00:39:54.696
I just wanted to make sure
that I'm not nuts.

793
00:39:54.696 --> 00:39:57.133
'Cause these findings.

794
00:39:57.133 --> 00:39:59.875
I have never seen anything
like them.

795
00:40:01.877 --> 00:40:05.011
Okay. these are Khione's?
They can't be.

796
00:40:05.011 --> 00:40:07.100
There's--there's no dark matter
or cold fusion traces.

797
00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.494
Chester. there has to be
a mistake.

798
00:40:09.494 --> 00:40:11.409
She made it snow indoors.

799
00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:12.845
She's obviously a meta.

800
00:40:12.845 --> 00:40:15.108
No. she's not.

801
00:40:15.108 --> 00:40:17.719
And that's not all.

802
00:40:19.591 --> 00:40:22.942
Khione's genetic code
is missing 55

803
00:40:22.942 --> 00:40:26.946
of 56 common
biometric signatures.

804
00:40:30.863 --> 00:40:33.039
Oh. I don't know
what that means.

805
00:40:33.039 --> 00:40:37.130
It means you're not a meta
like Frost.

806
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:40.481
But you're not human
like Caitlin. either.

807
00:40:40.481 --> 00:40:42.570
Wow.

808
00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:45.486
Then... what am I?

809
00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.560
Greg. move your head.
