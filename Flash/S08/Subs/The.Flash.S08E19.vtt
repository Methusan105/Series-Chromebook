﻿1
00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:08.008
All right. prepare to die.
Klamulon scum.

2
00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:11.261
The USS Engager is about
to crash the mode on your asses.

3
00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:13.388
How do I turn this on?

4
00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.393
Oh. cool. Okay. All right. Here we go.

5
00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:22.397
Oh. come on. Why do I have to be
the Squid Clam Warriors?

6
00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:24.566
‘Cause you're the enemy
and I'm the hero. Okay?

7
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.651
That's how this works.

8
00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:26.568
Now. raise your shields.

9
00:00:26.652 --> 00:00:28.529
because I'm ranked top ten
on the global leaderboards

10
00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:30.197
and you're about to get
your butt kicked.

11
00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:35.327
Hey. that's my ship.
That's my global ranking.

12
00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:39.665
No. no. no. no. Go somewhere.

13
00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:41.875
-You hate this game.
-Not anymore.

14
00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.380
Oh. crap. Uh...

15
00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:52.261
-Hi. Bart.
-Oh. Mom. It's crazy you called.

16
00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:54.596
I was pulling an all-nighter
studying for this midterm.

17
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.807
-Yeah. No. you weren't.
-Yeah. No. I wasn't.

18
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.976
Never try to fool someone
who's won two Pulitzers.

19
00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:00.811
Look. Nora. I'm glad I have you.

20
00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.813
Your last story did so well

21
00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:05.399
that I would like you
to write a follow-up piece.

22
00:01:05.983 --> 00:01:07.776
Yeah. sure. When's the deadline?

23
00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:10.320
Uh. if you could get something
to me by--

24
00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:13.949
Mom? Mom?

25
00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:16.034
Yeah. that looked like
more than just bad service.

26
00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:23.959
Bart? Nora. is that really you?

27
00:01:24.543 --> 00:01:25.711
Uh. sis...

28
00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:29.423
is it just me
or does Mom look really young?

29
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:34.052
Oh. shrap.

30
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.742
Mom. what's the last thing you remember?

31
00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.747
I was in my office with Taylor.
then I got lost in the time stream.

32
00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:04.499
Guys. I need to talk to your dad
about what happened.

33
00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:08.712
-Uh. Dad's off-world with Uncle Jay.
-But past-Dad is still looking for Mom.

34
00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:12.966
I know he's gonna figure this out.
We should really get you back to 2022.

35
00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:26.647
What was that?
Why can't you run back in time?

36
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.231
I've seen those particles before.

37
00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.817
Mom. I think the Still Force
is keeping you here.

38
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:31.818
Why would Deon do that?

39
00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:34.613
Mom.

40
00:02:36.198 --> 00:02:38.033
-No. it's gone. I'm okay.
-No. you're not.

41
00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:39.242
Sis. what are we supposed to do?

42
00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:40.911
We don't even know what
this time sickness stuff is.

43
00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:41.828
let alone how to cure it.

44
00:02:41.912 --> 00:02:44.956
Or how Mom got infected
in the first place.

45
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:56.009
- I know this is a big step.
- Yeah. I'll say.

46
00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:59.304
Now. that... That's a superhero.

47
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.684
Are you sure I. like. need to wear this?

48
00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:05.143
Maybe we're moving too fast.

49
00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:09.648
These suits monitor our vitals and
allow us to communicate with each other.

50
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:14.486
That keeps us safe.
just in case something happens.

51
00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.738
Like my connection
to the Negative Speed Force.

52
00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:17.989
I know you can handle this.

53
00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:20.075
and I will be there with you
every step of the way.

54
00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:26.415
- You okay?
- Yeah.

55
00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:29.876
Yeah. Let's get back to training.

56
00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:42.222
You're at Mach 1.7.

57
00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.267
1.78.

58
00:03:45.434 --> 00:03:47.352
Wow. that's double
her last recorded speed.

59
00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:51.189
Meena. your heart rate's in the red.
You need to slow down.

60
00:03:51.273 --> 00:03:55.026
- No. I can get to Mach Two.
- You're pushing yourself too hard.

61
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.028
I told you. I got this.

62
00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:10.208
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

63
00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:13.670
-I just got the wind knocked out of me.
-What were you thinking?

64
00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:15.797
Speed-healing
doesn't make you invincible.

65
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:17.424
Don't you think I know that?

66
00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:29.728
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:34.232
And you're right. okay?

68
00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:38.737
I'm a disaster.

69
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.578
I'll talk to her.

70
00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:58.590
Get it together. Meena. Get it together.

71
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.844
- Oh. God. You got this.
- Pull it together. Okay.

72
00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:06.973
I'm done. I'm done. I'm done.

73
00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:25.242
I'm sorry. Flash. I appreciate
everything you've done for me...

74
00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:29.120
but I'm not ready for this.

75
00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.916
Meena. why are you
pushing yourself so hard?

76
00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:39.798
You can lap the planet in seconds.
I can barely stay on a treadmill.

77
00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:42.801
Flash. how am I supposed to be a hero?

78
00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:46.888
-You already are.
-No. I'm not.

79
00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.475
Flash. I don't have what it takes.

80
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.727
-I think you do.
-Why?

81
00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:55.438
Because. honestly. when I first
built that machine. I wanted--

82
00:05:59.985 --> 00:06:01.069
I wanted...

83
00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:04.573
nothing.

84
00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:07.909
Look.

85
00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:11.663
I'll never be the person you are.

86
00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:19.212
Holy crap.

87
00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:24.259
-You're--
-Officer Barry Allen. CSI.

88
00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:28.930
So the fastest man alive
is a badge with a day job?

89
00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:32.934
-That's so--
-Ordinary.

90
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:35.478
Yeah. that's my point.

91
00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:39.608
You'd be surprised
at people's capacity to rise up

92
00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:41.860
and help others during a crisis.

93
00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:44.821
They just need
to be given the opportunity.

94
00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:49.409
That suit. that's your opportunity.

95
00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:53.246
I think you're gonna
be surprised at how well it fits.

96
00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.583
But you have to give yourself a chance.

97
00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:07.260
- Damn. that's good.
- I have my moments.

98
00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:13.308
Fine. I'll give it a shot.

99
00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:18.021
Besides. I already have my own suit.

100
00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:20.649
Guess all I need is
my own superhero name.

101
00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:22.692
No. you already have that. too.

102
00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:25.820
Fast Track.

103
00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:32.369
Fast Track.

104
00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.966
So you're here to fulfill my destiny.

105
00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:51.054
Well... you can start
by getting me out of this prison.

106
00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:53.098
And then...

107
00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:57.519
giving me my speed back.

108
00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:01.564
Oh. you'll get everything
that you deserve. Thawne.

109
00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:05.068
Is that right?

110
00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:10.782
And just what is that going to cost me?

111
00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:13.451
Just one thing.

112
00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:20.375
-Your life.
-No. Wait. No!

113
00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:47.318
What is it?

114
00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:49.320
There was just a major
energy surge in Lian Yu.

115
00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:51.740
-What kind of energy?
-The temporal isotopic kind.

116
00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:52.699
Deon.

117
00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:54.367
Let us know what you find
when you get there.

118
00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:56.119
After last time. I reached out to Cisco.

119
00:08:56.745 --> 00:08:58.705
S.T.A.R. Labs now has
a secure comm link to the island.

120
00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:11.885
Find anything. boss?

121
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.846
It's Thawne. He's dead.

122
00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:20.685
It's like his body was aged
a hundred years in an instant.

123
00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:23.772
Which the Still Force could easily do.

124
00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:27.901
Why would Deon kill Thawne now?
Doesn't make any sense.

125
00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:30.737
Deon hasn't been himself
since we went to search for Iris.

126
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:34.783
Sorry. Barr. Gotta bounce.

127
00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:39.204
It's exactly what I was afraid of.
Her time sickness has infected his mind.

128
00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:41.998
Chester. can our isotopic sensor
find him?

129
00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:46.211
No. It worked last time because Deon
exited the Still Force for a moment.

130
00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:49.756
But now that he's disappeared.
we're flying blind.

131
00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:52.926
With the power to travel across
the past. present and future...

132
00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:55.845
he could turn up at any moment.

133
00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:05.438
So you were out patrolling last night?
You told me you were working late.

134
00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:07.565
I was. Kinda.

135
00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:10.902
Look. babe.
you don't have to worry about me.

136
00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:15.198
Guess what. I don't just throw emotions
in and out of people now.

137
00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.534
I can induce vertigo. too.

138
00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:20.161
-You mean like Rosa Dillon?
-Yeah.

139
00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:21.121
Babe. that's not a good thing.

140
00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:23.414
It's not like
I'm some kind of super villain.

141
00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:25.458
Joe. I would think
that you would be happy for me.

142
00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:28.628
I am. But I just wish
I knew how all this happened.

143
00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:33.716
Oh. speak of the devil.
We are about to have a visitor.

144
00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:37.720
Wait for it.

145
00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:41.683
-Come on in. Rosa.
-Hold up. hold up.

146
00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:44.060
Ain't nobody invite
your criminal behind in here.

147
00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:47.647
Really? 'Cause I think she did
when she stole all my powers.

148
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:48.565
Uh...

149
00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:51.985
Wait. You what?
Cecile. is that why you leveled up?

150
00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:55.029
Okay. time out. I think...
I think that I can explain--

151
00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:58.074
You think? I want my powers back.

152
00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:00.410
-Why do you think I was tailing you?
-Oh. you what?

153
00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:02.245
I was tailing her.

154
00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:06.374
Right after all my powers went missing.
I got a mental image of her in my mind.

155
00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:08.042
So. yeah. I thought I'd swing by

156
00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:09.586
to see if I could get to
the bottom of all this.

157
00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:13.256
Now. that makes sense. But how did
Cecile end up with your meta-powers?

158
00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:14.757
I. uh-- Hear me out.

159
00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:17.635
You know how I can throw emotions
into somebody else? I can take them--

160
00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:20.013
-Yeah. I taught you that.
-Right.

161
00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:24.767
It seems like now somehow I can actually

162
00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:28.938
tap into the powers
of any psychic that's nearby.

163
00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:31.149
Okay. you live off of Third Street.
right?

164
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.319
-Yes.
-Yes. Last night I was out patrolling.

165
00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:37.906
There was somebody who needed protection
from a mugger. and I thought to myself.

166
00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:42.744
"I wonder if I could use
Rosa's vertigo powers."

167
00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:46.539
and I tried it. and I did it.
and it worked.

168
00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:50.168
That can't be a coincidence.

169
00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:55.423
Congratulations. You cracked the case.

170
00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:59.969
But I still don't have my powers back.
You got an explanation for that. too?

171
00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:04.390
-No. she doesn't.
-No. I don't.

172
00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:07.227
-Then what am I supposed to do?
-l don't know.

173
00:12:08.102 --> 00:12:11.147
What? My theory is just that.
It's a theory.

174
00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:13.358
Then you need to test it.

175
00:12:17.528 --> 00:12:22.116
Hey. David. Sorry to bother you. man.
I need a favor from the chief of police.

176
00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:27.372
I need two visitor passes
to the meta-wing in Iron Heights ASAP.

177
00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:29.165
Thank you so much.

178
00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:38.883
So that's what's causing my life
to be a nightmare.

179
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:40.677
I'm afraid so.

180
00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:45.682
It's a negative tachyon.
and your body is flooded with them.

181
00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:48.059
They're the cause of your time sickness.

182
00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:50.645
-So how'd they get there?
-l don't know.

183
00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:55.525
But the negative tachyons inside you
are increasing exponentially.

184
00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:58.945
And that's putting an incredible strain
on your physiology.

185
00:13:00.154 --> 00:13:02.031
Your body can't withstand this forever.

186
00:13:05.576 --> 00:13:07.287
-Mom.
-It's okay.

187
00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:16.504
I saw the Forces. Bashir. Deon. Alexa.

188
00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:19.340
But something happened.
They were different.

189
00:13:20.758 --> 00:13:22.135
Why would I see something like that?

190
00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:26.723
All I can theorize is that
somehow your sickness

191
00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:30.101
must also be triggering
some kind of temporal visions.

192
00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:35.148
-It's the only way.
-Agreed.

193
00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:37.400
But someone needs to stay here
to keep Mom safe.

194
00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:38.901
You were with Dad in the Speed Force.
I'll stay here.

195
00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:40.611
I'll go to 2022 and get help.

196
00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:42.572
-Are you sure that's a good idea?
-No.

197
00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:47.618
But if anybody can help save Mom...
it's Dad.

198
00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:55.543
You're gonna burn yourself out.

199
00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:58.379
You've been training
all morning with the Flash.

200
00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:02.175
and now. instead of resting.
you're pushing yourself even harder.

201
00:14:03.217 --> 00:14:07.096
-Eobard. you're worrying too much.
-Meena. you need to ease up.

202
00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:11.100
Not yet. I need to keep training.

203
00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:14.479
Why? So you can kill yourself?
What's gotten into you?

204
00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:20.234
Eobard. what's the point
of having these powers--

205
00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:31.621
We've been looking for you. Eobard.

206
00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:34.082
Who are you people?

207
00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:38.461
Who we are isn't important.
At least not to a dead man.

208
00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:40.296
Whoever or whatever you are.

209
00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:42.090
you need to get the hell out
of my building.

210
00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:43.049
Oh.

211
00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:48.346
Before I make you.

212
00:14:49.138 --> 00:14:51.099
Oh. I like her.

213
00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:54.602
Well. don't get too attached.
Play time's almost over.

214
00:14:55.144 --> 00:14:58.481
-What's that supposed to mean?
-You'll find out soon enough.

215
00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:01.901
- I'm not kidding. Back off.
- Or what?

216
00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:05.738
You have no idea
who you're up against. do you?

217
00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:10.451
-Then enlighten me.
-We're the true Forces of the universe.

218
00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:15.790
Ones written in darkness.
And we're here to kill you. Thawne.

219
00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:18.709
So you can fulfill your purpose.

220
00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:24.465
Don't look so negative.

221
00:15:26.884 --> 00:15:28.428
I promise I'll make it fast.

222
00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:38.438
-l won't let you hurt him.
-I was hoping you'd say that.

223
00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:39.897
I can taste her fear.

224
00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:44.026
- Ooh. amuse-bouche.
- Hold on.

225
00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:48.072
Too easy.

226
00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:51.701
Looks like you're the last Thawne left.

227
00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:58.708
Hope you enjoyed
your time. man. 'Cause you're all out.

228
00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:00.001
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

229
00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:03.796
-What is it?
-He's coming.

230
00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:13.598
Not fast enough. Flash.
Besides. this ain't your kind of party.

231
00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.351
- I'm gonna crush you...
- ...like a grape.

232
00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:20.605
What the--

233
00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:33.659
Who are they?

234
00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:35.286
Whoa. whoa.

235
00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:38.831
It's my speed. Something's wrong.

236
00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:41.167
Well. it probably had something to do
with that light show you just put on.

237
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:44.504
No. it's like when Meena
attacked me at the dam.

238
00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:48.007
-Only much stronger.
-They tried to kill Eobard.

239
00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:52.428
-Just like at Lian Yu.
-And that's just the beginning.

240
00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:56.098
You see. there's only room for
one set of Forces in the universe.

241
00:16:56.807 --> 00:16:57.892
The negative ones.

242
00:16:57.975 --> 00:16:59.810
And we're tired of sharing our turf.

243
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.438
Speed Force Nora and the others.
what did you do to them?

244
00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:05.191
Oh. he just gave them
a case of the Mondays.

245
00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:07.860
It'll be a while
before you see them again.

246
00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:10.613
Why are you doing this.
and what does it have to do with me?

247
00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:11.822
You're not the Avatar.

248
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:15.117
You just being here makes us weak.

249
00:17:15.284 --> 00:17:17.870
So sacrifices got to be made. Flash.

250
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.040
And you've got to pay for what you did.

251
00:17:27.338 --> 00:17:30.424
I don't care who they are.
I won't let them hurt Eobard.

252
00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:31.509
Whoa. whoa.

253
00:17:31.592 --> 00:17:32.718
-Whoa. whoa. whoa!
-Hey.

254
00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:35.054
All right. we need to get him some help.
Come on.

255
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.390
I think it just arrived.

256
00:17:38.349 --> 00:17:40.309
Uh. Chester?

257
00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:43.563
Oh. yeah. yeah.
So sorry about the hacking comms thing.

258
00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:46.065
but once I saw the Flash's vitals.
I had to track him down.

259
00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:48.401
Do you think you can bring
the Flash to S.T.A.R. Labs?

260
00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:51.445
Yeah. Be there in under a minute.

261
00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:55.199
-Good. 'Cause he's got company.
-The best kind.

262
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.832
Caitlin. why are you helping me?
I thought you gave up on Frost.

263
00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:03.874
I had.

264
00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:07.086
But after I saw your designs.

265
00:18:07.628 --> 00:18:10.089
I realized I'll never stop
trying to bring her back.

266
00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:12.258
I can't.

267
00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:24.395
Okay. if all goes according to plan.

268
00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:26.689
the pod's cerebral circuitry
should stimulate

269
00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:30.234
and then reactivate Frost's residual
subconscious left inside your mind.

270
00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:33.821
-And then I'll get her voice back.
-Yeah. Then when she's with us again--

271
00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:36.949
We can pick up where we left off
and build her a new body.

272
00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:42.830
Hey. what if Barry
discovers what we're doing?

273
00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:45.458
You know. he pulls you out.
destroys the CRC?

274
00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:47.668
Then we'll find another way.

275
00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.293
It was like slamming into
a brick wall.

276
00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:32.505
It didn't matter how fast I was.

277
00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:36.425
The negative tachyons in Mom's body
won't let her travel through time.

278
00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:40.554
I still can't believe we have to fight
Negative Forces or that they even exist.

279
00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:43.891
True that. And what did they mean
by Thawne's not the Avatar?

280
00:19:47.061 --> 00:19:52.024
Dad. you said that it was just
Negative Deon. Alexa and Bashir.

281
00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:56.278
But there was no Negative Speed Force
Nora. Where was she?

282
00:19:57.238 --> 00:20:00.825
This other Deon
said I had to pay for what I did.

283
00:20:00.908 --> 00:20:02.910
And I took away Thawne's speed

284
00:20:02.993 --> 00:20:05.204
by severing his connection
to the Negative Speed Force.

285
00:20:05.287 --> 00:20:06.914
Which might have erased Negative Nora.

286
00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:10.000
That must be why they're weaker now
and why they blame you.

287
00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:12.878
Maybe they think that killing Thawne

288
00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:15.589
will somehow bring back
the Negative Speed Force Avatar.

289
00:20:15.673 --> 00:20:16.549
Hold on.

290
00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:21.387
If they're tired of sharing their turf.
they'd wanna level the playing field.

291
00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:23.431
By weakening the forces we know.

292
00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:29.770
Iris' time sickness.

293
00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:34.942
It was never about her.
They knew Deon would try to help.

294
00:20:35.109 --> 00:20:37.528
And Mom's sickness
would spread to the Positive Forces.

295
00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:39.071
Taking them out of the picture.

296
00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:41.198
Wait. Hold on.

297
00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:44.326
What happens if the bad Forces
end up being the only ones left?

298
00:20:45.536 --> 00:20:47.496
Then every speedster we know
could cease to exist.

299
00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:51.667
Leaving the entire planet unprotected
from the Negative Forces.

300
00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:55.713
Nora. you need to run back to 2049.

301
00:20:56.505 --> 00:20:59.383
You and Bart have to watch over Iris
while we face the Forces here.

302
00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:02.803
But you're still too weak
to fight again. Dad. if they come back--

303
00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:05.264
They will.
But nobody's gonna die tonight.

304
00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:08.476
We're gonna find a way to save
your mom and end this. I promise.

305
00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:16.525
Barr. these Forces?

306
00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:19.695
They're literally gods.
and there's three of them.

307
00:21:20.404 --> 00:21:21.447
How are we supposed to fight that?

308
00:21:32.458 --> 00:21:36.045
It's all three isotopic energy masses.
Electrochemical. temporal

309
00:21:36.378 --> 00:21:37.213
and geothermic.

310
00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:39.673
They're gathering strength
on their own planes of existence.

311
00:21:39.757 --> 00:21:40.674
That's what's bleeding through.

312
00:21:47.431 --> 00:21:51.310
Look. guys. I know this feels different.
That's because it is.

313
00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:55.856
This is personal to them. which means
it's not gonna be an ordinary fight.

314
00:21:56.106 --> 00:21:57.441
We need to be ready for anything.

315
00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.903
Have you heard back from Cecile yet?

316
00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:04.198
Yeah. Joe said she was at Iron Heights
and that it's important.

317
00:22:04.281 --> 00:22:06.951
She thinks she might know
how her powers are leveling up.

318
00:22:07.034 --> 00:22:09.078
-But she'll be here as soon as she can.
-Good.

319
00:22:09.411 --> 00:22:11.413
'Cause we're going to need
all the meta-power we can get.

320
00:22:15.793 --> 00:22:19.046
Mona. I don't have much time.
so here's how it's gonna go.

321
00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.465
I'm gonna take those off.
you're gonna read my mind.

322
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:22.383
Tell me what I'm thinking.

323
00:22:23.425 --> 00:22:24.969
-If you can.
-With pleasure.

324
00:22:26.262 --> 00:22:27.805
Don't get any ideas. Mona.

325
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:31.433
She's taking the cuffs off.
but this is a meta interrogation cell.

326
00:22:31.517 --> 00:22:32.810
The walls are meta-dampened.

327
00:22:33.102 --> 00:22:35.145
SO you won't be able
to read anything except us.

328
00:22:35.646 --> 00:22:37.857
Like I wanna read
that empty mind of yours.

329
00:22:38.816 --> 00:22:40.276
-Watch it.
-Or what?

330
00:22:40.943 --> 00:22:42.236
You're gonna put me back in prison?

331
00:22:42.319 --> 00:22:46.198
Can we save it for the playground.
ladies? And. Mona. no tricks.

332
00:22:48.742 --> 00:22:50.494
Now. let's have some fun.

333
00:23:01.171 --> 00:23:03.007
Oh!

334
00:23:04.466 --> 00:23:08.178
What'd you do to me?
My telepathy is gone.

335
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:10.264
Oh!

336
00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:14.435
Excuse me. Somebody has a potty mouth.

337
00:23:15.269 --> 00:23:18.230
And no. Rosa. you are not
the good cop in this situation.

338
00:23:18.314 --> 00:23:19.899
'Cause you stole her powers. too.

339
00:23:27.197 --> 00:23:28.032
What is it?

340
00:23:30.576 --> 00:23:31.660
I can hear them.

341
00:23:33.287 --> 00:23:37.124
All of them. Everyone. I can hear
the entire city. all of their thoughts.

342
00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:39.710
This is personal to them.
which means it's not gonna be

343
00:23:39.793 --> 00:23:40.669
an ordinary fight.

344
00:23:40.753 --> 00:23:41.587
Barry.

345
00:23:42.004 --> 00:23:43.339
We need to be ready
for anything.

346
00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:47.009
-Barry. We have to go.
-What the hell. Horton?

347
00:23:47.092 --> 00:23:49.803
No. No way. She said
these walls were meta-dampened.

348
00:23:49.887 --> 00:23:52.431
How can you read
every single mind in town all at once?

349
00:23:52.514 --> 00:23:53.390
Even I couldn't do that.

350
00:23:53.474 --> 00:23:55.017
I don't know.
I don't understand it either.

351
00:23:55.976 --> 00:23:56.852
I think I do.

352
00:23:58.437 --> 00:24:01.023
Look. I don't know how.

353
00:24:02.024 --> 00:24:06.362
but. Horton. you're becoming
one of the most powerful metas

354
00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:07.863
this city has ever seen.

355
00:24:09.323 --> 00:24:11.951
- The planet. for that matter.
- What?

356
00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:16.121
What's happening to me?

357
00:24:23.796 --> 00:24:27.883
You're telling me this is just some
sick play by the Negative Forces?

358
00:24:29.718 --> 00:24:30.552
Damn.

359
00:24:30.636 --> 00:24:35.432
The negative tachyons replicating
inside Iris' body keep increasing.

360
00:24:36.517 --> 00:24:38.519
I don't know if she'll survive
another temporal attack.

361
00:24:38.602 --> 00:24:41.021
-There's got to be something we can do.
-There is.

362
00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:44.566
Pray that Barry can find the strength
to defeat the Negative Forces.

363
00:24:45.734 --> 00:24:49.863
Because it's the only way
to cure Iris and save her life.

364
00:24:58.872 --> 00:24:59.748
Hang on.

365
00:24:59.832 --> 00:25:00.874
There's no time
to stop and talk.

366
00:25:00.958 --> 00:25:02.626
I need to keep training
for our next fight.

367
00:25:02.793 --> 00:25:03.627
Hey.

368
00:25:06.213 --> 00:25:07.214
I know you.

369
00:25:08.048 --> 00:25:10.884
And that adorable
brow furrow thing you're doing.

370
00:25:10.968 --> 00:25:13.262
that only happens
when something's really bothering you.

371
00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:15.889
So you want to tell me what's wrong now?

372
00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.600
I mean. aside from cosmic forces
trying to kill me.

373
00:25:19.852 --> 00:25:24.023
Because you have been pushing yourself
beyond your limits all day.

374
00:25:24.481 --> 00:25:25.983
and you still haven't told me why.

375
00:25:26.316 --> 00:25:29.903
And with the way things are now.
I get it. Look. I'm scared too. Okay?

376
00:25:31.447 --> 00:25:33.741
But whatever happens.
let's face it together.

377
00:25:38.746 --> 00:25:43.584
I told Barry this morning
that I could never be a hero like him.

378
00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:47.463
I don't have what it takes.

379
00:25:47.546 --> 00:25:50.549
So he convinced you otherwise.
and that's why you're training so hard.

380
00:25:50.632 --> 00:25:52.676
-You're afraid of letting him down.
-No.

381
00:25:54.845 --> 00:25:56.555
I'm afraid of letting you down.

382
00:25:58.515 --> 00:26:02.811
Eobard. this... this was always
supposed to be you.

383
00:26:03.353 --> 00:26:07.357
And it should be. This is your dream.

384
00:26:07.775 --> 00:26:10.360
- You're keeping it alive.
- That's what makes it worse.

385
00:26:11.528 --> 00:26:15.616
I never wanted to be a speedster.
l... I still don't.

386
00:26:17.868 --> 00:26:21.538
Eobard. I wanted to share
meta-powers with the world

387
00:26:21.622 --> 00:26:26.710
so people could heal their bodies
and live fuller lives.

388
00:26:29.088 --> 00:26:29.922
That was my dream.

389
00:26:32.508 --> 00:26:33.717
Now I'm afraid of losing it.

390
00:26:35.552 --> 00:26:36.553
You're not.

391
00:26:38.514 --> 00:26:40.015
Because what you're doing now.

392
00:26:41.225 --> 00:26:44.228
risking your life
to fight side by side with the Flash

393
00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:47.397
to make me safer.
to make the city safer...

394
00:26:50.317 --> 00:26:52.152
Meena. it's the same dream.

395
00:26:54.154 --> 00:26:55.739
And you may not be able
to share your speed.

396
00:26:55.823 --> 00:26:58.033
but you're doing something far greater.

397
00:26:58.951 --> 00:27:01.370
You're sharing yourself with all of us.

398
00:27:04.748 --> 00:27:06.125
And I couldn't be prouder.

399
00:27:19.805 --> 00:27:21.140
How did I get so lucky?

400
00:27:23.267 --> 00:27:24.518
Blame it on a resume.

401
00:27:31.608 --> 00:27:35.487
God. I wish the B.L.O.C.
wasn't only programmed to just me.

402
00:27:36.738 --> 00:27:40.033
If only there was a way for me
to share this gift with you.

403
00:27:43.954 --> 00:27:44.830
You can.

404
00:27:47.416 --> 00:27:50.752
I'm sorry. I just came down
to check on your training.

405
00:27:50.836 --> 00:27:51.837
I didn't mean to intrude.

406
00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:57.384
Meena. I've been trying all day to find
a way to give us a fighting chance

407
00:27:57.467 --> 00:27:59.469
against the threats
we're facing with no luck.

408
00:27:59.553 --> 00:28:02.764
but... you just found the answer.

409
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.185
Which is?

410
00:28:07.895 --> 00:28:10.063
I'm gonna teach Meena
how to share her powers.

411
00:28:11.607 --> 00:28:12.858
And turn you into a speedster.

412
00:28:12.882 --> 00:28:14.882
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

413
00:28:58.987 --> 00:29:01.865
Okay. people.
according to S.T.A.R. Labs satellites.

414
00:29:01.949 --> 00:29:04.451
those isotopic energies.
they're on the move.

415
00:29:04.534 --> 00:29:06.662
Let me guess.
They're headed straight for us?

416
00:29:06.745 --> 00:29:09.164
The Negative Forces want a fight.
let's give it to them.

417
00:29:09.706 --> 00:29:10.832
You guys know the plan.

418
00:29:11.083 --> 00:29:13.377
Just keep them occupied
long enough for us to do this.

419
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:19.174
Okay. Now what?

420
00:29:20.634 --> 00:29:24.513
Take Eobard's hand.
listen to my voice and concentrate.

421
00:29:25.347 --> 00:29:27.891
All right. Let's do this thing.

422
00:29:28.976 --> 00:29:30.435
You're gonna need this first.

423
00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:52.833
Flash. what happened to me
at Keystone Dam.

424
00:29:53.417 --> 00:29:54.584
what if it happens to Eobard?

425
00:29:54.668 --> 00:29:58.380
It won't. For the same reason
you were able to become yourself again.

426
00:29:59.298 --> 00:30:02.259
The love you have for each other
balances you both.

427
00:30:16.315 --> 00:30:18.692
What is this. the B-team?
You got to be kidding me.

428
00:30:19.985 --> 00:30:23.071
-Clearly y'all have a death wish.
-I'm a little disappointed.

429
00:30:23.322 --> 00:30:24.531
Get used to that feeling.

430
00:30:48.221 --> 00:30:49.097
Nothing's happening.

431
00:30:49.431 --> 00:30:51.641
Transferring speed
isn't just about energy.

432
00:30:51.725 --> 00:30:52.976
it's about how you feel.

433
00:30:53.643 --> 00:30:56.104
You're sharing more than your powers.
You're sharing yourself.

434
00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.066
Imagine giving
the most important part of yourself

435
00:30:59.149 --> 00:31:00.442
to another by letting them in.

436
00:31:15.916 --> 00:31:18.585
No way. You're not this strong.

437
00:31:19.044 --> 00:31:21.004
Allegra. now.

438
00:31:24.424 --> 00:31:26.009
Okay. that's really bad.

439
00:31:26.134 --> 00:31:30.806
Ooh. Allegra. time to play.

440
00:31:31.848 --> 00:31:33.642
I'll make this fast.

441
00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:45.529
Do your worst. lady.

442
00:31:46.154 --> 00:31:49.616
That's an inverse energy trap.
Good luck fighting yourself.

443
00:31:59.167 --> 00:32:01.711
I feel alive.

444
00:32:04.464 --> 00:32:06.842
But there's so much hate.

445
00:32:08.885 --> 00:32:10.429
It burns.

446
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.850
The Negative Speed Force
is trying to influence you.

447
00:32:14.933 --> 00:32:18.186
You have to fight it. You have to
help each other find a balance.

448
00:32:23.233 --> 00:32:26.528
I'm over here.

449
00:32:31.074 --> 00:32:31.908
Boo.

450
00:32:34.703 --> 00:32:35.537
So close.

451
00:32:40.375 --> 00:32:41.209
Psst.

452
00:32:44.754 --> 00:32:45.881
Ooh!

453
00:32:45.964 --> 00:32:47.048
You're bad at this.

454
00:32:53.972 --> 00:32:55.849
Poor orphan Allegra.

455
00:32:56.391 --> 00:33:00.770
The power of light in your hands
but born into a life of darkness.

456
00:33:00.854 --> 00:33:03.356
What is that.
some kind of evil poetry diss?

457
00:33:03.607 --> 00:33:05.525
'Cause you're gonna need
a lot more than that to scare me.

458
00:33:08.195 --> 00:33:10.197
Why would I scare you...

459
00:33:12.574 --> 00:33:13.617
when I can kill you?

460
00:33:19.414 --> 00:33:21.708
I can't hold him much longer.

461
00:33:23.126 --> 00:33:24.252
The field's breaking down.

462
00:33:25.879 --> 00:33:26.713
She's too strong.

463
00:33:53.907 --> 00:33:57.035
Don't give up. Don't give up. We've
gotta buy them as much time as we can.

464
00:33:57.285 --> 00:34:00.413
It's too late. You're all out.

465
00:34:06.211 --> 00:34:08.421
Meena. remember what I told you.
This is your chance.

466
00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.884
Your moment. You can do this.
You can be a hero. And you're not alone.

467
00:34:22.352 --> 00:34:24.271
Looks like y'all gotta bounce.

468
00:34:25.313 --> 00:34:26.356
Permanently.

469
00:34:35.532 --> 00:34:38.076
Back off. All of you.

470
00:34:39.661 --> 00:34:40.745
That's your only warning.

471
00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:43.206
Seriously?

472
00:34:44.249 --> 00:34:46.668
-That's all you got?
-It's three against one. Flash.

473
00:34:46.751 --> 00:34:48.295
You don't stand a chance.

474
00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:51.548
Good thing I brought backup.

475
00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:14.779
-It's time for some payback.
-You sure we can do this?

476
00:35:14.863 --> 00:35:16.323
As long as we work together.

477
00:35:39.638 --> 00:35:41.598
-Where'd he go?
-I'm guessing not far.

478
00:35:53.068 --> 00:35:54.027
Mom.

479
00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:55.987
Mom. you have to stay with us this time.

480
00:35:56.321 --> 00:36:01.117
The Forces he's fighting...
Barry... It's a new moment in time.

481
00:36:01.409 --> 00:36:03.161
-What does she mean?
-It's another vision.

482
00:36:03.244 --> 00:36:05.497
I think she's seeing something
from 2022.

483
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.916
This can't be happening.
Time is changing.

484
00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:10.794
Whatever's happening in the past
is connected to her time sickness.

485
00:36:10.877 --> 00:36:12.379
and now it's literally
changing the future.

486
00:36:12.462 --> 00:36:14.547
Which means we have no idea
how this will turn out.

487
00:36:14.631 --> 00:36:16.132
- l can't.
- No. No. Mom. stop.

488
00:36:16.216 --> 00:36:17.342
Wait. We're not losing you.

489
00:36:19.219 --> 00:36:20.220
No. Wait. No.

490
00:36:20.303 --> 00:36:23.181
Sacrifices got to be made. Flash.

491
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:24.224
What is it?

492
00:36:25.433 --> 00:36:26.851
The visions.

493
00:36:28.937 --> 00:36:29.854
They're not random.

494
00:36:36.361 --> 00:36:39.781
You can't win. Flash.
We're weak. but so are you.

495
00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:43.326
Which means we can handle
anything you dish out.

496
00:36:47.497 --> 00:36:49.165
This might be our only window
to win this fight.

497
00:36:49.749 --> 00:36:52.502
But to do it. I need you two
to hold them here while I get ready.

498
00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:03.054
I have to give in.

499
00:37:03.138 --> 00:37:04.723
-No. Mom. you can't.
-I have to.

500
00:37:04.806 --> 00:37:06.725
It's the only way to see
what's really happening.

501
00:37:06.808 --> 00:37:07.642
Iris. wait.

502
00:37:08.643 --> 00:37:12.105
You're not the Avatar.
You just being here makes us weak.

503
00:37:12.188 --> 00:37:14.524
And you've got to pay for what you did.

504
00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:17.777
What are you doing?
We needed that to find Iris.

505
00:37:17.861 --> 00:37:19.362
Sacrifices got to be made.

506
00:37:19.821 --> 00:37:22.657
No. The sacrifice isn't Thawne.

507
00:37:24.534 --> 00:37:25.493
It never was.

508
00:38:06.659 --> 00:38:07.952
The real sacrifice is...

509
00:38:49.786 --> 00:38:53.206
Iris? Iris? Iris?

510
00:38:55.124 --> 00:38:56.543
No. no. no.

511
00:39:02.298 --> 00:39:03.550
I told you. Flash.

512
00:39:04.384 --> 00:39:10.890
We're tired of taking the back seat
to those sorry-ass opposites of yours.

513
00:39:11.432 --> 00:39:13.977
Sacrifices had to happen.

514
00:39:17.647 --> 00:39:19.357
And that ain't the only one.

515
00:39:48.678 --> 00:39:49.554
What?

516
00:39:55.518 --> 00:39:59.314
-Eobard? Eobard? Hey.
-Get back.

517
00:40:01.816 --> 00:40:03.067
Something's wrong.

518
00:40:08.531 --> 00:40:09.699
What's happening to him?

519
00:40:32.305 --> 00:40:33.640
Thanks for the resurrection...

520
00:40:36.142 --> 00:40:37.185
Flash.

521
00:40:37.209 --> 00:40:45.209
