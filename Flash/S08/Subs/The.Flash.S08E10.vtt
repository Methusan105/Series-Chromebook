﻿1
00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:08.759
Deon. what's happening to me?

2
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.969
The temporal mutations
I've been tracking?

3
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.805
It turns out every one of them
leads to you.

4
00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.266
I know I've been treating
your time sickness

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.435
like it's a virus
that's giving you symptoms.

6
00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:19.895
The gaps in time.

7
00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:23.857
And now I've been noticing that things

8
00:00:24.608 --> 00:00:26.527
are there one minute
and they're gone the next.

9
00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:29.863
There's something about you that's
causing time to fracture around you.

10
00:00:30.948 --> 00:00:32.866
Iris. this isn't a virus that you have.

11
00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:35.327
Whatever this time sickness is--

12
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.745
It's coming from me.

13
00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:49.258
What is it?

14
00:00:52.678 --> 00:00:53.512
What's wrong?

15
00:01:09.528 --> 00:01:10.529
How do you feel right now?

16
00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:13.574
Well. I mean. that's what's so weird.
I feel fine.

17
00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:17.703
And this is all because of what happened
in the other timeline?

18
00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:18.829
Yeah.

19
00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:20.789
I should've never reversed
your treatments.

20
00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:22.708
No. it's not your fault. Deon.

21
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:25.419
I asked you to do it.
and it was the right thing to do.

22
00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:29.715
There was no other way to prove Barry's
innocence and to save my dad's life.

23
00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:34.261
But these anomalies you're experiencing.
I mean. who knows what's next?

24
00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.263
-Well. we have to find a cure.
-And we will.

25
00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:39.057
Right now. we've got to
get you stabilized.

26
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.893
I'm sorry.
but you gotta stay put.

27
00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:46.231
Well. I mean. there are worse places
to hang out.

28
00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:49.276
How long do I have to stay?

29
00:01:49.735 --> 00:01:53.405
Well. considering the universe
is like a zillion light years large.

30
00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:56.783
I'd say staying put is a relative thing
when it comes to Earthly movement.

31
00:01:56.867 --> 00:01:59.578
So I'm thinking that if you confine
your movements

32
00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:02.998
to Coast City for a while.
it should lessen the risk.

33
00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:05.375
Or at least I hope so.

34
00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:08.337
Good. because there's still
someone here that needs my help.

35
00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.631
What if she has another episode?

36
00:02:10.756 --> 00:02:12.799
Well. I'll have to do something
a little more radical this time

37
00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:13.842
to patch you up.

38
00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:16.678
Look. I won't lie to you guys.

39
00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:18.263
This is gonna hurt.

40
00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:35.489
-You all right?
-Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

41
00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:36.865
I'll be back as soon as I can.

42
00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.117
Iris. if you have any blackouts

43
00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:41.286
or anything weird happens.
you let me know ASAP.

44
00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:53.548
Okay. I'm gonna go grab
a few of my things from home.

45
00:02:53.632 --> 00:02:55.008
I'll be back in a few seconds.

46
00:02:55.092 --> 00:02:56.510
No. no. Barry. you can't.

47
00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:59.262
I mean. remember what you said
about that black fire.

48
00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:01.431
There are people that are still
in danger. You have to stop it.

49
00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:03.433
But I can't just leave you here alone.

50
00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:05.227
I'm not. I mean. Sue will be back soon.

51
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.646
and besides. I mean.
I have work to do. too.

52
00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.233
Your world is falling apart

53
00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:12.943
and you're still worried about
helping other people.

54
00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:17.864
You just call me if you need anything.

55
00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:20.158
-I will.
-Okay.

56
00:03:50.147 --> 00:03:52.691
Now that is what you call art.

57
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.076
Since when do I sweat?

58
00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:23.430
What the hell?

59
00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:31.938
Is Iris okay?

60
00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:35.650
Yeah. I mean. you know.
as well as she can be.

61
00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:38.320
Well. Barry.
are you sure you don't wanna...

62
00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:41.823
I mean. Team Flash can hold down
the fort. if you need to be with her.

63
00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:43.784
No. thanks. Iris is right.

64
00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:45.577
I mean. as long as she's stable.

65
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.246
keeping everyone safe
in Central City is the priority.

66
00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.082
Joe. Cecile. you guys found anything?

67
00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:55.545
Uh. well. besides all suffering
recent personal losses. no.

68
00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.048
None of our fire victims
had anything in common.

69
00:04:58.215 --> 00:05:00.801
Yeah. Barr. I triple checked
the victims' files.

70
00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:06.014
Stan Mullens. Donna Winters.
that yoga instructor. Parker DeStefano.

71
00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:08.517
At first. we thought
all these freaky flames

72
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.811
are feeding on people
who recently mourned. like Mullens.

73
00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:14.064
Then it attacked me
and my dad died when I was a kid.

74
00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.732
Which doesn't follow the pattern.

75
00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:18.068
Maybe it's looking for people
who don't face their grief.

76
00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.319
No. I don't think so.

77
00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:22.447
DeStefano had completed grief counseling
after her fiancé died.

78
00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:24.783
and she was already seeing somebody new.

79
00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:26.910
Well. I've assigned Vanya and Aariz

80
00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.829
to dig into the backgrounds
of our victims.

81
00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:30.372
for secondary similarities.

82
00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:33.416
You sound just like Iris.
No wonder she put you in charge.

83
00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:38.004
Speaking of similarities.
Kramer pulled files

84
00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:42.259
for every suspicious fire-related crimes
since the particle accelerator exploded.

85
00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:45.011
So. me and Cecile have to
go through all of it.

86
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.515
And there's a ton.
So are you ready. babe?

87
00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:49.432
Mm.

88
00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:50.851
Later.

89
00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:01.111
What's an SR37 alert?

90
00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:02.863
Someone just entered the Med Lab.

91
00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:05.615
What? Is Caitlin back from
her wine country tour with Marcus?

92
00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:06.741
No. not yet.

93
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.034
Stay here.

94
00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:18.879
Hey. Any idea where
Caity keeps the bandages?

95
00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:21.423
It seems more like a "top shelf"
kinda thing. if you ask me.

96
00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:23.258
-What happened to your arm?
-Oh.

97
00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:26.511
Our freaking fire attacked me
at the apartment.

98
00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:31.099
And before you ask.
no. I don't know why it didn't kill me.

99
00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:33.226
-Were you--
-Grieving?

100
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.645
Nope. I was perfectly happy
working on a new piece.

101
00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:37.564
Could be the best thing I've ever done.

102
00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:39.900
But that does not explain

103
00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:42.402
why our Sentient Smokey Joe
would attack me.

104
00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:45.196
and only leave me with this.

105
00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:47.574
Frost. come here. Let me help. Ow.

106
00:06:48.325 --> 00:06:49.159
Ah.

107
00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:51.411
You make a good Caity-substitute.

108
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.041
Maybe it's like Joe says.
there's got to be something more.

109
00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:59.461
-It's after something we're missing.
-Something I have?

110
00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:01.880
I don't know.

111
00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:07.594
But. I mean. this fire attacked
you and me here at S.T.A.R. Labs.

112
00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:11.556
And then follows you home
less than 24 hours later?

113
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.643
That can't be a coincidence.

114
00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:19.856
So if we can figure out why the flames
think I'd be a tasty snack...

115
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.483
Maybe that could tell us how to stop it.

116
00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:26.988
Frost. um. if it's okay. I'd like to
search your apartment top to bottom.

117
00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:29.240
see if there's any clues as to why
the fire is targeting you.

118
00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:30.158
Go for it.

119
00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:31.701
Okay.

120
00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:45.131
Frost. Been a while
since we caught up. What's wrong?

121
00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:48.677
It's about Team Flash's new case.
and this one's a little creepy.

122
00:07:49.344 --> 00:07:52.097
Over the last few weeks.
three bodies have turned up.

123
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.057
all of them burnt to a crisp.

124
00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:55.976
So this is an arson case?

125
00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:57.143
Mm...

126
00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:58.478
More like a ghost story.

127
00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:01.439
The fires that did the damage
were black.

128
00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:04.109
And so cold that they burn the victims

129
00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:06.486
like frostbite.
only 1.000 times more lethal.

130
00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:09.614
And you need my help to figure out
what's causing this phenomenon?

131
00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:10.740
Not exactly.

132
00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:14.536
The flames are alive
and they are attacking people.

133
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.538
and I think they're coming after me.

134
00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:21.543
My God. of course. I'll do
whatever I can to help keep you safe.

135
00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:24.713
Actually. I need you
to do just the opposite.

136
00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:29.968
I want you to help me catch this thing.
using me as bait.

137
00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:44.941
You want to use yourself as bait
to capture the black fire?

138
00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:47.360
I know how it sounds. but hear us out.

139
00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:52.198
If this homicidal stuff is after me now.
why not use it to our advantage?

140
00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:54.159
Carla. you can't actually
be considering this.

141
00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:55.827
I wasn't at first.

142
00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:59.748
And then Frost laid out the facts in the
case. how it's killing innocent people.

143
00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:01.332
And now it's coming after her. too.

144
00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:04.252
with flames that generate a cold
so intense it burns?

145
00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:08.339
That last item is almost an exact
description of how cold fusion works.

146
00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:11.009
But why is the fire attracted to Frost?

147
00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:14.304
I believe it's because
her meta abilities are cryokinetic.

148
00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:16.639
just like our cold fusion fire.

149
00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:18.850
So you think it's hunting her for fuel?

150
00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:20.310
To recharge itself?

151
00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:22.812
Correct. So the key to catching it

152
00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:25.523
is to wait until it comes
after her again and then trap it.

153
00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.984
Frost. we are not using you as bait.

154
00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:31.404
Look. this is a perfectly good plan
that could save lives.

155
00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:32.655
Why won't you at least let us try?

156
00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:34.908
Because this feels like a last resort.

157
00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:37.160
Besides. there's still so much
we don't know about this fire.

158
00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:40.497
I mean. even if we tried this.
we still have no way to capture it.

159
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.582
Cold fusion is still a fusion reaction.

160
00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:44.751
one that occurs at
a low molecular temperature.

161
00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.588
If we could build some kind
of fusion containment housing...

162
00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:51.132
Then all we'd need to do
is recalibrate the unit

163
00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:54.177
to absorb and amplify
Frost's cryokinetic signature.

164
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.930
Yes. Then. as long as Frost
is in proximity.

165
00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:59.766
the unit can amplify
her cryokinetic signature.

166
00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:03.436
and attract the fire.
allowing us to capture and imprison it.

167
00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:08.525
Of course. building a unit like that
could take weeks or longer.

168
00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:13.905
Well. not that I'm saying
we should do this at all.

169
00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:17.534
but we kind of already have
what you're describing.

170
00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:18.743
We do?

171
00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:21.079
The Fusion Sphere from the ASF.

172
00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:24.958
It can already handle the entire output
of the artificial Speed Force.

173
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:30.088
If Dr. Tannhauser and I recalibrate it
for a cryokinetic signature.

174
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.714
we'd be in business.

175
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.049
Great. Then it's settled.

176
00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.593
Chester. you and Mom
work on the nerd stuff.

177
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.929
-Allegra. you and I--
-Wait around for you to get killed?

178
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:42.851
Barry. whatever this thing is.
it's coming after me no matter what.

179
00:10:43.017 --> 00:10:45.854
So I am not going to sit around
and do nothing

180
00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:48.064
when we have a plan to fight back.

181
00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:51.359
Barry. it's your call.

182
00:10:52.443 --> 00:10:53.278
Ditto that.

183
00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:57.824
I'm sorry. but I can't support this.

184
00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:01.828
I know we don't have
another plan right now.

185
00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:03.913
but putting you in harm's way?

186
00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:06.374
There's got to be another option.

187
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.381
I still think this could work.

188
00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:15.967
Get started. I'll be back.

189
00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:23.766
Look. I'm not going to change my mind.

190
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.518
Okay. fine. But just hear me out.

191
00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:28.855
Before this. you were telling us
about Iris and her condition.

192
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.482
How she wants to help Tinya.
but Deon told her to stay put.

193
00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:36.237
Do you really think
that's what she's doing right now?

194
00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:37.697
Because if I know Iris...

195
00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.658
She's gonna try and help Tinya
find her mom.

196
00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:44.412
Instead of sitting in a hotel.
doing nothing and helping no one.

197
00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:46.414
But she's not
endangering herself either.

198
00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:49.417
But she is doing
what this whole team does best.

199
00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:50.960
Helping people.

200
00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:53.379
Despite what it could mean
for themselves.

201
00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:58.009
Sound familiar?

202
00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:03.139
Look. my mom is the world's
top specialist in cold fusion.

203
00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:05.558
and she thinks this will work.
Chester agrees.

204
00:12:06.517 --> 00:12:08.561
So why won't you give me the chance
to make a difference

205
00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:09.687
that you're giving Iris?

206
00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:15.318
Okay.

207
00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:20.323
-But if anything goes wrong--
-You'll pull the plug. Got it.

208
00:12:23.534 --> 00:12:24.577
Yes!

209
00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:31.918
I finished fine-tuning the sphere to
amplify Frost's cryokinetic signature.

210
00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:34.796
Now make sure to calibrate
the containment housing--

211
00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:36.297
To compensate for the possibility

212
00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:38.591
of a reconfiguration flip
at the subatomic level?

213
00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:39.550
Already done.

214
00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:43.846
Really? Well. when this is over.

215
00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:46.432
there's a job waiting for you
at Tannhauser Labs.

216
00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:48.184
Spoiler. I pay better.

217
00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:51.271
For real?

218
00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:57.068
I mean. nah.
you know. I actually kinda like it here.

219
00:12:58.111 --> 00:12:58.987
Suit yourself.

220
00:13:00.863 --> 00:13:02.198
We're ready. Frost.

221
00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:10.665
Okay. What next?

222
00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:14.460
Chester. activate
the cold Fusion Sphere.

223
00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:21.342
Now remember. the sphere will amplify

224
00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:24.470
your cryokinetic signature.
drawing the fire near.

225
00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:26.139
But you need to stay in the gurney

226
00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:29.017
until the fire is pulled into
that sphere and we've trapped it.

227
00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:33.938
Okay. so now we just wait around

228
00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:36.316
for some sentient fire
to come get its dinner?

229
00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:37.817
That could take forever.

230
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.485
Not if Carla is right.

231
00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:43.239
The sphere will amplify Frost's
cryo signature exponentially.

232
00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:46.034
Like an animal scent
getting broadcast to a larger area

233
00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:48.244
to entice a predator and draw them in.

234
00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:50.580
Making Frost honey on a fly trap.

235
00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:54.167
Once it senses her. it'll pounce.
And then we've got it.

236
00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:58.087
If this spooky thing is looking for fuel
instead of just grief.

237
00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:00.173
it's the place to find it.

238
00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:04.761
Frost. about what you're doing.

239
00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:07.221
I don't know if I'd have
the strength to do the same.

240
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.808
I mean. I'm just saying
you're very brave.

241
00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:12.352
Thanks.

242
00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:17.565
Although right now. I kinda feel like
the stupid person in the horror movie

243
00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:20.693
who runs into the house
instead of running away from it.

244
00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:26.157
Folks. our intelligent ignition source

245
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.077
just popped back up on the grid
and it's heading here fast.

246
00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:33.081
Somebody turned up the heat.

247
00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:34.332
It's here.

248
00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:42.340
It's working.

249
00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:56.229
Why did it stop?

250
00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.065
Something's not right.

251
00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:02.443
What are you waiting for?

252
00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:04.362
Come and get me.

253
00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:07.365
It knows what we're planning.

254
00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:15.081
Frost!

255
00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:33.558
Thank goodness you're all right.

256
00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:37.603
We're lucky your boss is a superhero.

257
00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:41.566
-Is she gonna be okay?
-l am fine.

258
00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:43.234
I thought you were on vacation.

259
00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:45.778
I was and then Allegra called and said

260
00:15:45.862 --> 00:15:47.155
you were using yourself as bait

261
00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:49.949
to summon an uncontrollable fire
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

262
00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:51.868
What the hell were you thinking?

263
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:55.037
That we could end this
and save folks' lives.

264
00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:57.290
Also. your bedside manner is terrible.

265
00:15:57.373 --> 00:15:59.125
Frost. she's right.
We're worried about you.

266
00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:02.545
Barry says you antagonized the flames.
Was that part of your plan. too?

267
00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:04.672
It didn't take the bait.
What else was I supposed to do?

268
00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:07.925
Okay. what happened out there
after the Babadook Blaze went postal?

269
00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:11.721
Once we got you back to the Med Lab.
I did a grid search of the entire city.

270
00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:13.014
There's no sign of it.

271
00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:16.350
We need to get back out there.

272
00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:18.603
What we need to do is find
another way to stop this thing.

273
00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:20.605
Frost. we know how dangerous
this thing is.

274
00:16:20.688 --> 00:16:23.483
I mean. it's killed three people
already that we know of.

275
00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:26.527
It came after me. again. We can do this.

276
00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:28.571
I hear the cold Fusion Sphere
didn't even work.

277
00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:31.657
More precisely. we never had a chance
to see if it would work.

278
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.702
The fire hesitated.
so it didn't get close enough.

279
00:16:35.369 --> 00:16:38.623
If only there was a way to make Frost
more attractive to the flames.

280
00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.209
Sounds like something
Chester can help us with.

281
00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:42.543
I'll have him meet us in the Speed Lab.

282
00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:44.045
Sit down.

283
00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:47.882
Can I have the room. please?

284
00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:50.885
You stay.

285
00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:00.144
I don't understand.

286
00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:03.064
You said over the phone that you could
give me the information in person.

287
00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:04.899
I am sorry. Mrs. West-Allen.

288
00:17:05.274 --> 00:17:06.526
You said you'd fix this.

289
00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:08.152
And I will.

290
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.864
Look. I've worked stories like this
before. and I've never had a problem.

291
00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:14.742
I know. But after your call.
I checked the files in question.

292
00:17:15.117 --> 00:17:16.911
It turns out there's
a no-contact rule in play.

293
00:17:18.454 --> 00:17:22.833
Wait. You mean someone doesn't want me
to find my own birth mother?

294
00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:26.128
Uh. who? I want to know right now.

295
00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:28.589
Okay. Tinya. hi.

296
00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:32.593
Why don't you just give us a few minutes
so that we can work things out?

297
00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:35.471
Right. She's my mom. all right?
I have a right to know the truth.

298
00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:39.308
Okay.

299
00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:46.941
Look. is there anyone we could talk to
about overriding a no-contact order?

300
00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:48.192
No one.

301
00:17:48.442 --> 00:17:51.445
I mean. I'd need approval from our board
of directors for something like that.

302
00:17:52.613 --> 00:17:54.115
Oh! Is that all?

303
00:17:55.366 --> 00:17:56.200
I got this.

304
00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:59.912
Hi. Uncle Leroy.

305
00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:01.872
Yes. it's Sue.

306
00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:03.416
Yeah. I'm in town for the day.

307
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.669
Yeah. I am so glad that you asked.

308
00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:10.923
I just need a little favor
from the R.A.A. Chairman of the Board.

309
00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:14.719
Yes. it's a no-contact order.
It's really important.

310
00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:16.762
I'm trying to help an orphan.

311
00:18:17.388 --> 00:18:20.516
I know. just like you.

312
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.018
It's for you.

313
00:18:25.855 --> 00:18:26.731
Yes. sir.

314
00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:30.985
Of course. no problem.

315
00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:32.695
Thank you.

316
00:18:36.407 --> 00:18:38.784
-Yeah. okay.
-Just a sec.

317
00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:48.127
Sorry about that.

318
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.504
Oh. no problem.
You were just doing your job.

319
00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:51.922
Thanks.

320
00:18:52.006 --> 00:18:52.840
Thank you.

321
00:18:58.012 --> 00:18:58.971
I need a break.

322
00:18:58.995 --> 00:19:00.995
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

323
00:19:23.537 --> 00:19:24.455
Okay.

324
00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:25.915
Ready for the next step?

325
00:19:30.294 --> 00:19:31.921
How about I go pull up the car?

326
00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:40.888
What's wrong?
I thought this is what you wanted.

327
00:19:43.349 --> 00:19:44.183
Um...

328
00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:48.562
What if my mom doesn't want to meet me?

329
00:19:50.731 --> 00:19:51.565
She will.

330
00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:55.403
Iris. she gave up on me
the moment I was born.

331
00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:58.322
So what if nothing's changed?

332
00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:02.576
Tinya. look. when I was your age.

333
00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:05.204
my mom wasn't in my life. either.

334
00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.332
and there was so much trauma around it.

335
00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:11.335
All the lies I had been told.
the feelings of abandonment.

336
00:20:12.336 --> 00:20:13.254
how much it hurt.

337
00:20:15.297 --> 00:20:17.883
And it got so bad
that when I finally had the chance

338
00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:21.387
to reconcile with my mom.
I almost lost the opportunity.

339
00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:27.351
And then someone made me realize
that reconnecting with my mom.

340
00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:30.354
no matter how or why was a gift.

341
00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:37.820
And let me tell you. I am really glad
that I listened to them.

342
00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:40.781
Because I barely

343
00:20:41.407 --> 00:20:44.034
got to heal my relationship
with my mother before she passed.

344
00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:49.582
Um...

345
00:20:51.834 --> 00:20:53.961
Hey. I'm really sorry.
I didn't know that.

346
00:20:54.044 --> 00:20:57.923
No. it's okay. I'm just saying
that I almost made a mistake

347
00:20:58.007 --> 00:21:00.384
that I would have regretted
for the rest of my life.

348
00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:02.803
How did you do it?
I mean. where did you even start?

349
00:21:03.137 --> 00:21:05.055
I told her I was scared.
I told her I was angry.

350
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:10.978
And also that I loved her.
even though I didn't know why.

351
00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:16.484
And. Tinya. whatever you do.
everything is going to be okay.

352
00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:18.903
Because you're not going to do it alone.

353
00:21:20.446 --> 00:21:21.363
I won't let you.

354
00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:28.788
Come on.

355
00:21:32.374 --> 00:21:34.543
Frost.
Why do you keep doing this?

356
00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:37.755
You need to stop putting your
personal safety in danger for nothing.

357
00:21:37.838 --> 00:21:41.133
Like when you stabbed yourself
just to get Chillblaine arrested

358
00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:43.344
-that first time.
-That turned out okay. This will. too.

359
00:21:43.427 --> 00:21:44.512
You don't know that.

360
00:21:44.595 --> 00:21:46.555
Damn it. Frost. it's like you
don't even care about yourself.

361
00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:48.766
I'm trying to help people.

362
00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:51.477
Right. Okay. but at some point.
you need to realize

363
00:21:51.769 --> 00:21:53.854
that you could also get yourself killed.

364
00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:55.564
And then you need to think. "Hmm.

365
00:21:55.648 --> 00:21:56.941
Maybe I shouldn't do this." or.

366
00:21:57.024 --> 00:21:58.943
"Hmm... Maybe I should come up
with a different plan.

367
00:21:59.026 --> 00:22:00.861
One that doesn't get me killed."

368
00:22:02.363 --> 00:22:05.574
And you. Mom. seriously.
how could you go along with this?

369
00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:08.828
Frost's powers presented an opportunity
to take this thing off the streets.

370
00:22:09.078 --> 00:22:10.913
And that's where our focus has been
ever since.

371
00:22:10.996 --> 00:22:13.541
You put her life at risk.
You realize that. right?

372
00:22:13.624 --> 00:22:14.834
Because she asked me to.

373
00:22:14.917 --> 00:22:16.252
And that makes it okay?

374
00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:20.047
Hey. we made a decision today
to try to protect people.

375
00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.341
I would think that you
would be fine with that.

376
00:22:22.424 --> 00:22:25.052
What I am not fine with
is losing Frost forever.

377
00:22:25.135 --> 00:22:26.971
which is what could have happened today.

378
00:22:27.513 --> 00:22:30.057
You used your child as bait
for a monster.

379
00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.892
It's not how I see it.

380
00:22:31.976 --> 00:22:34.019
No. you don't. because
you're looking at Frost

381
00:22:34.103 --> 00:22:36.313
as a science experiment
instead of as your daughter.

382
00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:41.694
Frost. please listen to me.

383
00:22:41.902 --> 00:22:43.988
You need to learn
to value your own life.

384
00:22:53.747 --> 00:22:55.875
Carla. you still think
that fusion globe will work?

385
00:22:58.085 --> 00:23:01.714
Yes. if we can find a way
to make sure it gets closer next time.

386
00:23:01.797 --> 00:23:03.507
Great. I'll have Chester
start working on it.

387
00:23:03.591 --> 00:23:05.342
Frost. wait. Uh...

388
00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:08.470
Our plan will work.

389
00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:15.060
You better hope it does. because
right now you have two daughters.

390
00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:16.687
But if something happens to Frost

391
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:20.024
because of something
you helped her with. you'll have none.

392
00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:43.422
Barr. I ran into Carla Tannhauser.

393
00:23:43.505 --> 00:23:46.300
She told me about her plan
to stop these devil flames.

394
00:23:47.426 --> 00:23:49.470
And your objection.

395
00:23:50.679 --> 00:23:51.513
Yeah.

396
00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:54.016
You want to tell me your side.

397
00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:55.893
because I'm pretty sure I'm not
the only one that wants

398
00:23:55.976 --> 00:23:57.353
to get these damn things off the street.

399
00:23:57.436 --> 00:24:00.105
Look. I know why she's doing this
and she's not wrong.

400
00:24:00.189 --> 00:24:01.649
If there's something
out there hurting people.

401
00:24:01.732 --> 00:24:03.651
then we need to do
everything we can to stop it.

402
00:24:03.734 --> 00:24:05.069
Right. So what's the problem?

403
00:24:05.778 --> 00:24:10.574
She's found a way to use Frost's powers
to lure the black fire here

404
00:24:10.658 --> 00:24:12.326
by boosting Frost's powers to trap it.

405
00:24:12.576 --> 00:24:17.039
-And that's a bad plan because...
-It's too dangerous.

406
00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:18.624
Frost has already been hurt once.

407
00:24:18.707 --> 00:24:20.918
If we try this again.
something even worse could happen.

408
00:24:25.589 --> 00:24:26.799
That's not all
you're concerned about. is it?

409
00:24:28.384 --> 00:24:30.010
I mean. my gut told me
this was a bad idea.

410
00:24:30.094 --> 00:24:30.928
I should have listened to it.

411
00:24:31.011 --> 00:24:34.848
And now you're worried about
not being able to stop it.

412
00:24:34.932 --> 00:24:36.642
because these things were set in motion?

413
00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:38.686
I'm team leader.

414
00:24:38.978 --> 00:24:41.271
Having a plan
that keeps everybody safe is my job.

415
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.815
Only today.

416
00:24:43.607 --> 00:24:46.318
I don't know how.
And now our only solution is

417
00:24:46.402 --> 00:24:48.487
putting a team member's life
in jeopardy.

418
00:24:48.821 --> 00:24:49.655
Hmm.

419
00:24:51.115 --> 00:24:53.534
Are you talking about Frost or Iris?

420
00:24:57.079 --> 00:24:57.913
Mm-hmm.

421
00:24:58.956 --> 00:25:00.582
I'm worried about her. too.

422
00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:05.337
But you're the one
who also left your wife in Coast City

423
00:25:05.421 --> 00:25:08.090
asking the same question
you're asking about Frost.

424
00:25:08.173 --> 00:25:12.302
Is it safe for her to continue
her mission or pull the plug?

425
00:25:13.595 --> 00:25:18.350
Look. I'm not the boss here.
So I can't make the decision for you.

426
00:25:19.727 --> 00:25:21.145
But I can tell you this.

427
00:25:21.937 --> 00:25:26.650
Sometimes the hardest part
about being a leader is letting go.

428
00:25:27.484 --> 00:25:31.196
and trusting the ones you've trained
to make the call themselves.

429
00:25:33.073 --> 00:25:34.450
And then you'll be there for them

430
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.535
in a blink of an eye.

431
00:25:45.627 --> 00:25:48.672
Took you long enough.
Jeez. where is Chester?

432
00:25:48.756 --> 00:25:49.798
We got a lot of work to do.

433
00:25:50.758 --> 00:25:51.675
He's not coming.

434
00:25:54.053 --> 00:25:55.304
Frost. I talked to Caitlin.

435
00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:56.930
Let me guess.

436
00:25:57.639 --> 00:25:58.807
She changed your mind.

437
00:25:59.975 --> 00:26:02.686
So what. now you're here
to give me some sort of mom talk?

438
00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.314
-Seriously?
-Yes. I am.

439
00:26:06.315 --> 00:26:07.399
Because I am your mom.

440
00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:10.319
And it's time I start acting like it.

441
00:26:11.862 --> 00:26:15.157
Frost. I think it's wonderful
that you have such a strong instinct

442
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.617
to protect people.

443
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.911
But from what Caitlin shared
and what I saw

444
00:26:18.994 --> 00:26:22.539
with my own eyes today.
I think your sister's right.

445
00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.125
You need to stop being so reckless.

446
00:26:25.292 --> 00:26:28.212
You don't get it. This is Team Flash.
Protecting people.

447
00:26:28.462 --> 00:26:29.588
kinda in the job description.

448
00:26:30.005 --> 00:26:31.924
No. you don't get it.

449
00:26:33.592 --> 00:26:35.177
You can't help anyone if you're dead.

450
00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:40.099
I swear. sometimes
you remind me of your father.

451
00:26:40.808 --> 00:26:43.477
Oh. A murderous psychopath. Gee. thanks.

452
00:26:43.769 --> 00:26:46.230
No. not Icicle. Thomas.

453
00:26:47.689 --> 00:26:50.734
Your father would do whatever it took
to protect his family. too.

454
00:26:50.984 --> 00:26:53.112
Including creating you to save Caitlin.

455
00:26:54.404 --> 00:26:56.657
But he took it too far
and it cost him a future

456
00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.117
with the people who loved him the most.

457
00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.993
And I don't want to see you
go down that road.

458
00:27:00.077 --> 00:27:01.036
Neither do I.

459
00:27:01.745 --> 00:27:04.957
Look. you people think I have
some sort of death wish or something.

460
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.083
but it's not that.

461
00:27:07.376 --> 00:27:10.879
I was literally born
to be Caity's bodyguard.

462
00:27:10.963 --> 00:27:12.756
Asking me not to jump
in the line of fire.

463
00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.716
it's like asking the sky
not to be freaking blue.

464
00:27:16.135 --> 00:27:19.721
Frost. you're more than a bodyguard.

465
00:27:20.806 --> 00:27:24.434
You're an incredible young woman
and a vital part of Team Flash.

466
00:27:26.228 --> 00:27:27.688
And of the Snow family. too.

467
00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:30.941
Because you're my daughter.

468
00:27:33.527 --> 00:27:36.446
And as your mother.
it's my job to protect you.

469
00:27:37.406 --> 00:27:40.784
Which is why I'm telling you
there's a time for protecting others.

470
00:27:40.868 --> 00:27:42.578
and there's a time
for protecting yourself.

471
00:27:43.453 --> 00:27:45.789
And now is the time to do the latter.

472
00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:51.837
I should have seen it before.
and I hope you do now.

473
00:27:54.798 --> 00:27:56.341
Yeah. I do.

474
00:28:00.554 --> 00:28:03.640
But what about the Phantom Flicker?

475
00:28:05.225 --> 00:28:06.935
I still think your plan would work.

476
00:28:07.311 --> 00:28:08.729
We just need to keep you safe.

477
00:28:08.812 --> 00:28:11.815
So the way to do that
is to trap the fire quickly.

478
00:28:12.983 --> 00:28:15.694
I think if we add a secondary
cryokinetic signature.

479
00:28:15.777 --> 00:28:17.613
it would make the meal more appetizing.

480
00:28:18.739 --> 00:28:20.616
-Like frosting on a cake.
-Mm.

481
00:28:21.158 --> 00:28:24.161
But I'm unique.
No one has cryo powers like me.

482
00:28:25.996 --> 00:28:26.914
I do.

483
00:28:30.334 --> 00:28:34.046
After your-- After Icicle put me
in his cryo-chamber.

484
00:28:34.129 --> 00:28:35.255
Caitlin and I did a test

485
00:28:35.339 --> 00:28:37.966
for any residual meta-genome signatures
in my body.

486
00:28:38.967 --> 00:28:40.093
Yeah. I remember.

487
00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.220
It came back negative.

488
00:28:41.303 --> 00:28:42.638
Mm. It was wrong.

489
00:28:43.513 --> 00:28:46.850
According to my research.
my exposure in Icicle's chamber

490
00:28:46.934 --> 00:28:48.560
activated a latent cryo-gene.

491
00:28:48.644 --> 00:28:52.814
I don't have ice powers yet.
but I have the potential for them.

492
00:28:54.441 --> 00:28:57.277
Frost. if we combine
your cryokinetic signature with mine--

493
00:28:57.361 --> 00:28:59.238
It would be impossible
for it to resist us.

494
00:28:59.488 --> 00:29:02.032
Yes. and there'll be less risk
because the fire won't hesitate

495
00:29:02.115 --> 00:29:03.867
and we'll be able to trap it quickly.

496
00:29:06.328 --> 00:29:07.287
What do you say?

497
00:29:09.039 --> 00:29:13.252
I'm in. Just one more person
we need to get on board.

498
00:29:13.377 --> 00:29:14.211
Not anymore.

499
00:29:16.296 --> 00:29:18.715
I'm still not thrilled
with how dangerous this plan is.

500
00:29:19.883 --> 00:29:21.677
But Mom's right.

501
00:29:21.969 --> 00:29:23.595
If the two of you work together.

502
00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:26.723
the fire won't hesitate.
and then we can trap it.

503
00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:29.142
And that will keep everyone safe.

504
00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:36.275
Guys. the black fire's back.
It just landed downtown.

505
00:29:36.525 --> 00:29:39.361
Yeah. So whatever you guys
are gonna do. it's now or never.

506
00:29:40.904 --> 00:29:43.115
Okay. let's take this thing out.

507
00:29:43.615 --> 00:29:44.700
Once and for all.

508
00:29:53.792 --> 00:29:54.751
How long have you known?

509
00:29:55.002 --> 00:29:58.255
That I have my own
cryokinetic signature? For a while now.

510
00:29:58.463 --> 00:29:59.715
Turns out it runs in the family.

511
00:29:59.798 --> 00:30:00.716
I can't believe you didn't tell us

512
00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:02.676
there's two Ice Queens
in the Snow family.

513
00:30:02.759 --> 00:30:04.177
And if you ever need
to learn more about

514
00:30:04.261 --> 00:30:06.179
how to control your powers.
we're here for you.

515
00:30:06.555 --> 00:30:08.140
Thanks. It means a lot.

516
00:30:09.016 --> 00:30:10.600
-Now let's get to work.
-Yes.

517
00:30:12.686 --> 00:30:13.645
Okay. we are ready.

518
00:30:13.979 --> 00:30:16.773
And. Mom. just so you know.
the tests I ran confirm your findings.

519
00:30:17.024 --> 00:30:19.276
Your latent genome
plus Frost's meta signature

520
00:30:19.443 --> 00:30:22.487
should amplify the sphere's
cryokinetic output exponentially.

521
00:30:22.571 --> 00:30:25.407
Giving our bonfire from hell
an offer it can't refuse.

522
00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:26.575
And then some.

523
00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.204
Listen. Barry. I know you've never been
on board with this plan. so.

524
00:30:31.413 --> 00:30:34.124
-if anything goes wrong...
-I know. You'll pull the plug.

525
00:30:34.833 --> 00:30:36.668
I trust you. All of you.

526
00:30:37.294 --> 00:30:38.211
Don't worry.

527
00:30:38.587 --> 00:30:41.798
If it comes to that. I'll still be ready
to get us all out of here in a second.

528
00:30:45.635 --> 00:30:47.554
Do you do this kind of thing
all the time?

529
00:30:47.637 --> 00:30:48.472
Do what?

530
00:30:48.722 --> 00:30:49.556
Be a hero.

531
00:30:49.639 --> 00:30:51.391
What can I say. it's a living.

532
00:30:51.475 --> 00:30:54.895
Yeah. They just don't tell you
how intense it can be.

533
00:30:55.896 --> 00:31:00.025
You're gonna do great. and remember.
what you're doing will save lives.

534
00:31:00.901 --> 00:31:03.028
-I know.
-And after this. we can get dinner.

535
00:31:04.613 --> 00:31:06.114
Okay. But only if you let me buy.

536
00:31:06.198 --> 00:31:07.741
-Absolutely.
-Okay.

537
00:31:10.994 --> 00:31:11.828
Okay.

538
00:31:13.413 --> 00:31:14.247
Their vitals look good.

539
00:31:15.415 --> 00:31:16.500
Activating the sphere.

540
00:31:22.089 --> 00:31:24.591
Okay. Focus on your powers. like this.

541
00:31:35.769 --> 00:31:36.770
I feel strange.

542
00:31:37.312 --> 00:31:38.897
-Means you're doing it right.
-Okay.

543
00:31:43.443 --> 00:31:44.653
Caitlin. how are they doing?

544
00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:46.238
Their bio-signatures
are in sync.

545
00:31:46.738 --> 00:31:49.699
Yeah. well. the containment system's
active. Chester?

546
00:31:51.034 --> 00:31:54.538
Great Otis Boykin.
It just changed direction.

547
00:31:54.621 --> 00:31:55.831
And heading straight for us.

548
00:31:56.748 --> 00:31:58.208
Contact in five...

549
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.463
Four... Three... Two... One.

550
00:32:27.821 --> 00:32:28.864
It's working.

551
00:32:59.978 --> 00:33:03.273
The sphere is losing its integrity.
it's trying to break free.

552
00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:07.569
-We have to abort.
-No! No. I can do this.

553
00:33:10.197 --> 00:33:12.699
Barry. we can't do this.
She's going into cardiac arrest.

554
00:33:12.782 --> 00:33:14.409
Carla. we have to let it go.

555
00:33:14.493 --> 00:33:17.204
No. it's worth it to sacrifice me.

556
00:33:42.521 --> 00:33:43.355
What happened?

557
00:33:44.064 --> 00:33:45.232
It's gone again.

558
00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:47.025
We still have no idea why.

559
00:33:54.616 --> 00:33:55.617
Did we get it?

560
00:33:55.992 --> 00:33:58.370
No. And that's okay.

561
00:34:03.041 --> 00:34:03.959
Oh.

562
00:34:19.266 --> 00:34:21.601
So you just let that hellfire go?

563
00:34:21.977 --> 00:34:23.728
It's on me. I made the call.

564
00:34:23.895 --> 00:34:25.230
And it was
the right thing to do.

565
00:34:25.355 --> 00:34:27.023
You put Carla and your own safety first.

566
00:34:27.107 --> 00:34:28.483
And you saved Mom's life.

567
00:34:28.567 --> 00:34:29.526
But Joe's right.

568
00:34:29.609 --> 00:34:31.570
We had a chance to stop it
and we didn't.

569
00:34:31.653 --> 00:34:35.907
No. that was before I knew you made
a judgment call. Frost. and a good one.

570
00:34:35.991 --> 00:34:39.536
Look. don't worry. we will stop
that thing. That's what we do.

571
00:34:39.619 --> 00:34:42.372
Yeah. your mom sounds
like she's a fighter.

572
00:34:42.998 --> 00:34:43.873
She is.

573
00:34:43.957 --> 00:34:45.792
She's going to make
a great meta.

574
00:34:46.835 --> 00:34:49.504
Just one thing. though.
We're back to square one.

575
00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:53.717
Joe. Cecile. have you found anything
that can help us

576
00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.843
in Captain Kramer's files?

577
00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:58.763
I wish. We are almost through them all.
and still nothing.

578
00:35:00.724 --> 00:35:02.726
So. we failed?

579
00:35:03.143 --> 00:35:05.270
No. we didn't fail. Thanks to Frost.

580
00:35:05.353 --> 00:35:07.981
Now we know the cold Fusion Sphere
can contain that thing.

581
00:35:08.064 --> 00:35:09.190
And that's a win.

582
00:35:09.274 --> 00:35:12.027
Barry's right. That means
we can try again to capture it.

583
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:13.320
And this time it will work.

584
00:35:13.528 --> 00:35:16.615
If we could create a strong enough
signal. the sphere could work

585
00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.743
without someone's cryokinetic RNA
in close proximity.

586
00:35:19.826 --> 00:35:21.202
Good. So no bait.

587
00:35:21.286 --> 00:35:23.455
Yeah. which'll keep
Frost and Carla safe.

588
00:35:23.538 --> 00:35:25.165
And then we can catch
the fire again.

589
00:35:26.124 --> 00:35:27.417
Take the fight to it this time.

590
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:34.007
I'm telling you. I'm okay. really.

591
00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:35.884
Caity says you need to rest.

592
00:35:36.468 --> 00:35:38.178
Fine. I'll stay the night.

593
00:35:38.303 --> 00:35:40.764
But then I promise. I'll be
out of your hair in the morning.

594
00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:42.474
It's really no problem.

595
00:35:43.099 --> 00:35:46.144
Also. I'm sorry I yelled at you two.

596
00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.105
Don't be. I needed to hear it.

597
00:35:49.189 --> 00:35:50.273
Both of us did.

598
00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:54.903
Thank you for keeping us safe.
like you always do.

599
00:35:54.986 --> 00:35:59.032
Good thing. too. 'cause I
couldn't lose you... Either one of you.

600
00:36:02.077 --> 00:36:03.870
Oh. shoot. It's Marcus.

601
00:36:04.621 --> 00:36:06.790
He has no idea what happened today.

602
00:36:07.957 --> 00:36:10.126
What happened to going all in?

603
00:36:10.377 --> 00:36:12.671
Yeah. I really do need
to tell him everything.

604
00:36:12.754 --> 00:36:14.714
Just. um... not tonight.

605
00:36:16.424 --> 00:36:20.679
Hey! No. I'm fine.
Just a crazy day at work.

606
00:36:21.262 --> 00:36:22.097
How are you?

607
00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:30.230
So about that dinner
we were supposed to have...

608
00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:32.607
How about we make it brunch
in the morning?

609
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:34.818
Absolutely.

610
00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:41.866
And. Frost. I need to apologize. too.

611
00:36:43.535 --> 00:36:46.454
I should have told you
about my condition sooner.

612
00:36:46.538 --> 00:36:52.127
I just... I guess I was just worried
about what it could mean for me.

613
00:36:54.671 --> 00:36:55.588
Maybe if we talked more.

614
00:36:55.672 --> 00:36:58.133
you would have felt more comfortable
sharing it with me.

615
00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:01.886
Yeah.

616
00:37:03.179 --> 00:37:04.013
It's okay.

617
00:37:04.097 --> 00:37:05.432
-Something to work on.
-Yeah.

618
00:37:10.979 --> 00:37:13.148
I've missed so much of your life.

619
00:37:14.399 --> 00:37:16.985
and that's my fault.

620
00:37:19.279 --> 00:37:21.823
There is so much about you
that I don't know

621
00:37:22.657 --> 00:37:24.492
and so much that I want to know.

622
00:37:26.286 --> 00:37:27.162
Really?

623
00:37:27.996 --> 00:37:32.542
Yes. of course. It's like I said before.
you're my daughter.

624
00:37:36.546 --> 00:37:37.964
And I love you. Frost.

625
00:37:39.883 --> 00:37:41.301
You do?

626
00:37:42.552 --> 00:37:43.803
More than you could ever know.

627
00:37:58.818 --> 00:37:59.778
You're okay.

628
00:38:13.625 --> 00:38:14.584
Can I help you?

629
00:38:17.587 --> 00:38:18.755
Are you Renee Wazzo?

630
00:38:20.256 --> 00:38:21.549
Who's asking?

631
00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:24.969
Your daughter.

632
00:38:32.894 --> 00:38:35.313
All the adoption websites
warn you about days like this.

633
00:38:36.356 --> 00:38:37.565
That's not what...

634
00:38:37.857 --> 00:38:38.733
I mean. it's just...

635
00:38:40.485 --> 00:38:42.320
I guess I knew
this might happen eventually.

636
00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:44.739
Maybe even wanted it.

637
00:38:47.075 --> 00:38:47.992
Yeah. me. too.

638
00:38:50.954 --> 00:38:52.747
Look. I'm sure you have
SO many questions.

639
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:55.875
Just one. actually.

640
00:39:01.673 --> 00:39:02.507
Um...

641
00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.009
Why didn't you want me?

642
00:39:10.974 --> 00:39:12.517
I always wanted you. Tinya.

643
00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.270
I want you to know that.

644
00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:19.899
The truth is. I wanted to be your mom
more than anything.

645
00:39:21.234 --> 00:39:22.360
but I was so young.

646
00:39:24.112 --> 00:39:27.949
I was 16 and confused.
and my parents were furious.

647
00:39:29.576 --> 00:39:34.956
They convinced me that the best thing
for both of us was to sign that clause.

648
00:39:36.499 --> 00:39:37.542
then give you away.

649
00:39:41.921 --> 00:39:43.006
They were wrong.

650
00:39:47.093 --> 00:39:49.971
I swear to you. I've never regretted
anything more than letting you go.

651
00:39:53.433 --> 00:39:54.893
The only way
I could get through

652
00:39:55.143 --> 00:39:57.812
this crap life of mine that came after
was the hope

653
00:39:58.938 --> 00:40:00.481
that you were living a good life.

654
00:40:02.984 --> 00:40:04.652
A better life without me.

655
00:40:09.782 --> 00:40:10.742
No. I'm not.

656
00:40:13.161 --> 00:40:14.037
I needed you.

657
00:40:17.582 --> 00:40:18.791
I needed my mother.

658
00:40:23.254 --> 00:40:24.088
Tinya. I--

659
00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:25.924
Iris?

660
00:40:29.719 --> 00:40:31.930
Whoa. What is wrong with her?

661
00:40:32.013 --> 00:40:33.139
I don't know.

662
00:40:33.598 --> 00:40:34.599
Are you okay?

663
00:40:44.025 --> 00:40:45.026
What the hell?

664
00:40:46.486 --> 00:40:47.528
Mom?

665
00:40:49.656 --> 00:40:52.075
Mom? Mom?

666
00:40:55.078 --> 00:40:56.412
What did you do to my mom?

667
00:41:14.931 --> 00:41:15.848
Frost?

668
00:41:19.686 --> 00:41:20.895
Frost. that isn't funny.

669
00:41:31.698 --> 00:41:32.782
Caitlin.

670
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:35.284
The world is different now.

671
00:41:36.577 --> 00:41:38.121
There is no normal life for us.

672
00:41:39.205 --> 00:41:40.123
Oh. my God.

673
00:41:40.581 --> 00:41:42.834
Cait. the world's different now.

674
00:41:43.668 --> 00:41:45.294
Look. I thought we could get away.

675
00:41:46.045 --> 00:41:49.173
Start a normal life together.
but there is no normal life for us.

676
00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:52.719
Ronnie?

677
00:41:52.743 --> 00:42:00.743
