ï»¿1
00:00:05.964 --> 00:00:06.882
Hey. you hungry?

2
00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:09.801
I was thinking blueberry pancakes
for breakfast this morning.

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.055
Or I could get us something fun
from that Brooklyn's Best Bagels place.

4
00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:15.766
They just opened
a new location downtown.

5
00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.937
Iris?

6
00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:07.276
Iris.

7
00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:22.833
Thanks for the company. Cecile.

8
00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.459
Anytime.

9
00:01:24.543 --> 00:01:27.004
You know. I figured you'd be
working this time of day.

10
00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:28.130
Oh. I was.

11
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.092
Yeah. I'm actually avoiding
a new meta client.

12
00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:33.302
so I figured I'd get out of the office.

13
00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:35.095
come over.
see what Team Flash was up to.

14
00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:40.851
Well. we're all good here. Yeah.
the town is quiet. No alerts. no crisis.

15
00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:44.396
Just sweet. sweet. silence...

16
00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.314
Okay.

17
00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:48.108
Barry. what's wrong?

18
00:01:49.568 --> 00:01:50.819
Yeah. should we be worried?

19
00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:53.280
It's Iris.

20
00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:56.241
She's missing.

21
00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:17.471
Satellites aren't picking Iris up
anywhere in the city.

22
00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:19.765
I'm gonna expand the physical
search radius.

23
00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:21.892
Cecile. anything?

24
00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:26.897
Nothing.

25
00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:30.442
I can't sense her either and I've
reached out across a five-state radius.

26
00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:32.861
It's like Iris' mind has just vanished.

27
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.280
Same here. only worse.

28
00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:39.618
Barry. Iris isn't registering
anywhere on the planet.

29
00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:41.119
How is that even possible?

30
00:02:41.203 --> 00:02:42.079
It's just like last time.

31
00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:45.290
She's not here anymore.
at least not in this plane of existence.

32
00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:47.668
She must've had another attack.

33
00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:50.379
Now she's lost in time.

34
00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:53.507
Okay. well. then we need Deon
to find her.

35
00:02:53.632 --> 00:02:55.175
No one's seen Deon since he disappeared.

36
00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:57.552
and I can't access
the Still Force without him.

37
00:02:58.261 --> 00:02:59.221
Okay. so...

38
00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:01.306
So what do we do?

39
00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:07.604
Okay. okay. it's a long shot. but.
look. when Iris was in Coast City.

40
00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:11.108
it wasn't just her time sickness
that caused her to vanish.

41
00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:14.528
Tinya Wazzo's powers did. too.

42
00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:24.079
I can't believe you're serious.

43
00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:26.707
You really want to try
and bring Frost back?

44
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.666
And I already have a plan.

45
00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.584
I'm going to repurpose Eva McCulloch's
R-CEM chip

46
00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:33.797
to replicate Frost's cryo genes
so I can create a new body for her.

47
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.842
Caitlin. I know you're hurting.
so am I. but listen to yourself.

48
00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.302
It worked before. it will work again.

49
00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:43.181
And what about the thing
that makes Frost... Frost?

50
00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:47.060
I have already identified her latent
empathic genes on my DNA.

51
00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:48.979
I'm talking about a soul
and you give me brain waves?

52
00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:54.067
I'm also going to extract
her active imprints from her own DNA.

53
00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:55.652
Look. I've already got the sample.

54
00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:59.531
Unfortunately. the keratin in the cells
is decaying a little too quickly. so...

55
00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.201
I'm going to need a better sample.

56
00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:05.203
Are you talking about grave-robbing?

57
00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:08.665
It's called an exhumation and I am
a doctor as well as the next of kin.

58
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.711
So getting approval won't be a problem.
We just. we need to do it quickly.

59
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.383
I know how this sounds.

60
00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:21.178
Oh. like that old horror movie
Frankenstein Created Woman?

61
00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:24.806
Does Team Flash know
what you're planning?

62
00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:27.434
Didn't think so.

63
00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:29.561
They wouldn't understand.

64
00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:30.771
Neither do I!

65
00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:35.901
Caitlin. have you forgotten that
you literally just tried to resurrect

66
00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:36.902
your dead husband?

67
00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.613
And it was a complete disaster?

68
00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:43.200
No. I haven't. but that thing
was never Ronnie. okay?

69
00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:46.495
Deathstorm used a physical form
that I love to try and trick us.

70
00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:48.455
Look. this is different.

71
00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:50.665
The science is solid. Trust me.

72
00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.877
Yeah. mad science.

73
00:04:55.295 --> 00:05:01.676
Mark. Mark. Frost was supposed to live
a full and complete life.

74
00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:06.640
You both were. together.
and now that's been taken from you.

75
00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:09.434
Don't you want that back?

76
00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:12.187
What do you think?

77
00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:20.278
You can process losing Frost
in whatever way you need to.

78
00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:21.822
but as far as
all of this is concerned...

79
00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:26.243
count me out.

80
00:05:57.357 --> 00:06:00.902
Tinya. uh. can we talk?

81
00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.195
Why? I don't know you.

82
00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:06.825
I'm Barry Allen.
You know my wife. Iris West-Allen.

83
00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.703
I'm really sorry.
but she's missing again

84
00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:10.704
-and I don't know--
-Again?

85
00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:12.539
Whatever. I don't care.

86
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.708
Your other half ruined my life.

87
00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:18.086
You have every right to be angry.

88
00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:19.880
I need your help.

89
00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:22.007
The first time Iris disappeared.
she was with you.

90
00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:26.177
You mean when I wiped her
out of existence like she did to my mom?

91
00:06:27.304 --> 00:06:28.305
Are you okay?

92
00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:35.061
What the hell?

93
00:06:37.314 --> 00:06:38.231
Mom?

94
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.860
What did you do to my mom?

95
00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:44.905
Tinya. she never meant to hurt anyone.

96
00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.239
Well. I did.

97
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.366
Which is why you should back off.

98
00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:52.621
Do you even understand
how your powers work?

99
00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:58.543
Examining how they work could help us
answer what's really happening to Iris.

100
00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:01.963
I don't care about Iris.
God. what is wrong with you?

101
00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:07.010
You know. I was fine until Iris found me
and started spewing all that crap

102
00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.554
about family and having faith in people.

103
00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:14.267
She made me believe that I could have
the life that I always wanted.

104
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.480
And now that's gone
and it's never coming back.

105
00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:21.983
So welcome to the club.

106
00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:53.556
Deon. thank God.

107
00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:56.226
-Iris is missing.
-Yeah. I know.

108
00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:59.854
Yeah. she's in the Still Force. I've
been trying to track her down. but...

109
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:00.814
Hey.

110
00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:01.773
No. don't. don't.

111
00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:05.819
I've been infected
by Iris' time sickness. too.

112
00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:10.824
I need you to find the Isotopic Sensor.

113
00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:14.869
It's the only way we can track down
that particle that I placed inside Iris.

114
00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:16.329
"We"?

115
00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:19.624
Barry. I can't find her alone.

116
00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:21.960
I'm gonna need your help.

117
00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:27.966
Okay. but the sensor's damaged.
We're going to need to repair it first.

118
00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:29.384
Okay.

119
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.094
Okay. do it fast.

120
00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:33.013
I'll come back for you after.

121
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.951
This is how we get Iris back.

122
00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:57.245
So you're saying that Deon
wants to do that by bringing you

123
00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:58.246
into the Still Force?

124
00:08:58.329 --> 00:08:59.998
Well. both of us. together.

125
00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:04.335
I thought he said it was too dangerous
for anyone to go in there who wasn't.

126
00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:05.295
you know. a god.

127
00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:08.214
It's risky. but I trust Deon.

128
00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:10.383
And he wouldn't suggest this
if there was any other way.

129
00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:12.218
Well. Deon's right about one thing.

130
00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:14.554
Our satellites can't trace
isotopic particles

131
00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:17.015
across other planes of existence.

132
00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.350
That's why we need you
to repair the sensor.

133
00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:20.727
It's the only thing that can locate

134
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.021
Iris' temporal particle
inside the Still Force.

135
00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:25.482
but once we find her. we bring her home.

136
00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:27.442
Amen to that.

137
00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:30.779
Not to question a god.
but why would Deon need help

138
00:09:30.862 --> 00:09:33.656
tracking a particle
that he created himself?

139
00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:38.620
Deon's not at full strength.

140
00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:40.705
Iris' time sickness
has affected him. too.

141
00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:47.754
Chester. how long will it take
to get the sensor running?

142
00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:50.590
An hour. maybe less.

143
00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:52.300
but Barr. how are you going to

144
00:09:52.383 --> 00:09:54.260
get inside the Still Force
in the first place?

145
00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:56.179
Deon's going to come back for me
as soon as he can

146
00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:57.472
and we need to be ready when he does.

147
00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:00.975
And you ran this plan past
the other Forces?

148
00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:05.021
Nora. Bashir. Alexa.
they're all on board. too?

149
00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:09.526
Uh. no. I haven't been
able to contact them.

150
00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:12.028
Any of them.

151
00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.364
And Iris' sickness.

152
00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:17.033
it could have spread to them already.

153
00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:19.702
Which would explain why
they've been radio silent.

154
00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:24.082
If that is the case.
then maybe we should all slow down

155
00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:26.751
and figure it out before we launch you

156
00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:29.712
into a place where
we know nothing about. Barry.

157
00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:30.755
There's no time.

158
00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:35.885
Look. Joe. Deon is our only chance
at finding Iris.

159
00:10:36.427 --> 00:10:39.639
If he says going into the Still Force
is the answer. then I believe him.

160
00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:42.934
I'm going to get the sensor
from the Starchives.

161
00:10:43.017 --> 00:10:44.185
Meet you in your workshop.

162
00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:45.770
I should get back to CCC.

163
00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:47.772
Got to keep the lights on
until Iris is safe.

164
00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:58.616
- Barr. hold up.
- What?

165
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.411
Look. I am willing to do
whatever it takes to bring Iris home.

166
00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:02.787
but something don't feel right
about this.

167
00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:04.622
It's dangerous.
but we've taken greater risks before.

168
00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:07.500
Yes. we have.
but are you sure about the facts?

169
00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:10.170
Because you seem to be putting
a whole lot of faith in Deon's plan.

170
00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:11.421
Because I know it'll work.

171
00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:14.883
That's what Deon thinks you should do.
What do you think you should do?

172
00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:16.050
That's just it. I don't know.

173
00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:17.093
And Deon does?

174
00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:20.305
Look. Joe. I owe Deon this.

175
00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:22.640
As soon as I learned
about Iris' time sickness.

176
00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:25.101
I should have spent every waking moment
trying to find a cure.

177
00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:27.770
Even when she told me to stop pushing.
but I didn't.

178
00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:29.898
Now it's worse.
plus Deon's affected. too.

179
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.860
If there's a chance I can find Iris and
make up for all this. I have to take it.

180
00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:52.253
-Parliament-Runkadelic.
-It's Captain Kramer.

181
00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:54.881
Yes. Yes. ma'am. How can I help?

182
00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:57.800
Chester. I need a full analysis
on an unknown device

183
00:11:57.884 --> 00:11:59.010
we found at a crime scene.

184
00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:02.472
You're not busy saving the world.
are you?

185
00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:05.725
No. no. Captain. your timing is perfect.

186
00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:07.977
Barry's gone to where no man's
been before.

187
00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:10.021
so I'm free to fly solo.

188
00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.190
Great. Thanks. I'll see you soon.

189
00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:14.400
Oh. you heard her. Chester P..

190
00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:17.737
the crime-fighting world
needs your mojo!

191
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:18.988
Mojo...

192
00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:19.906
Mojo.

193
00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:22.700
Seven out of ten.

194
00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:39.133
Oh. damn. moving through dimensions
is getting harder. Is that it?

195
00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:41.552
Yeah. are you sure we can find her?

196
00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:45.890
There's just one thing. Where we're
going. there's only one way in and out.

197
00:12:46.557 --> 00:12:47.725
and it's a bumpy ride.

198
00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:52.563
So hang on. because things
are about to get real weird.

199
00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:02.115
Don't worry. you'll get used to it.

200
00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:04.534
I've been here before.

201
00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:08.705
-When Iris--
-First got sick. yeah.

202
00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:12.792
Place is like a doorway.

203
00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:15.753
I call it my front porch.

204
00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:20.466
I can see everything from here.

205
00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:39.319
This place is different than before.

206
00:13:39.777 --> 00:13:41.988
Yeah. that's because it's
more dangerous now.

207
00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:46.242
Welcome to the Still Force.

208
00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:49.537
What's left of it.

209
00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:04.052
Sorry about the mess.

210
00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:06.220
How bad is it?

211
00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:09.682
Ever since Iris got lost here.
things have been mad disorganized.

212
00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:12.226
I mean. night becomes day
in the blink of an eye

213
00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:14.812
and just as fast. it's night again.

214
00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:19.150
And now it's getting worse.

215
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:32.288
You see. past. present and future
all exist here simultaneously.

216
00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:34.374
but now the balance is all out of whack.

217
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:39.837
See what I mean?

218
00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:45.343
All right. now. stay close to me
because if we get separated...

219
00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:46.386
I could get lost. too.

220
00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:47.387
Or worse.

221
00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:49.430
You could get trapped in a dead zone

222
00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:51.516
where time just repeats itself
indefinitely.

223
00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:53.976
If that happens.

224
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:56.521
I'd never get you out.

225
00:14:59.982 --> 00:15:01.651
Sensor's picking up Iris' signature.

226
00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:04.070
All right.
Let's ease on down the road. man.

227
00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:17.083
-We're getting close.
-Yeah.

228
00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:18.668
...my decision is not...

229
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.672
Oh. one thing. once we find Iris.
let me try and stabilize her first

230
00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:23.756
before we do anything else.

231
00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:25.341
They need to know
what you've been hiding.

232
00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.051
- All right.
- Taylor. don't.

233
00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.887
This is my life. my decision.

234
00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:31.848
It's not what you think.

235
00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:33.015
I know those voices.

236
00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:35.351
They need to know-- They need
to know what you've been hiding.

237
00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:36.978
Taylor. don't-- Don't.

238
00:15:37.311 --> 00:15:39.397
This is my life. my decision.

239
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.606
It's not what you think.

240
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.109
They need to know what--
You've been hiding.

241
00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:45.153
Taylor. don't. Taylor. don't.

242
00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:47.447
-This is my life. my decision.
-What is this?

243
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:48.865
They need to know--
Been hiding.

244
00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.992
It's a future moment
that's stuck on repeat.

245
00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:53.744
They need to know what you've
been hiding. They need to know...

246
00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:56.038
They can't move onward and become
part of the past.

247
00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:56.956
My decision.

248
00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:58.249
It's not what you think.

249
00:15:58.332 --> 00:15:59.625
They need to know
what you've been hiding.

250
00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:00.543
Taylor. don't.

251
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.421
My life-- My life. my decision.
Taylor. don't.

252
00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:04.714
This is-- This is my life.

253
00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:05.840
How do we stop it?

254
00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:09.677
We can't. not till we find Iris
and fix this whole place.

255
00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.765
Help me.
Someone. please help me.

256
00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:21.481
Help me.

257
00:16:22.523 --> 00:16:23.983
Please. I don't know
what's happening to me

258
00:16:24.066 --> 00:16:25.693
and I have to get back to my daughter.

259
00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:27.028
Renee.

260
00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:31.741
Renee Wazzo. you're Tinya's mom.

261
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:35.077
Yes. do you know where she is?
I have to find her before--

262
00:16:37.705 --> 00:16:39.457
She's trapped in here. too.
just like Iris.

263
00:16:40.374 --> 00:16:41.250
We have to find her again.

264
00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:43.211
Tinya thought she'd lost her.
but if her mom's alive--

265
00:16:43.294 --> 00:16:45.755
Uh-uh. She's fractured.
just like me and Iris. all right?

266
00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:47.340
We need to stick to why we're here.

267
00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:50.343
Deon. we have to help her. Renee
has been lost in all this for weeks.

268
00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:54.347
Hey! What we need to do is keep moving
or else Iris is history.

269
00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:58.476
She's the key to everything. man.

270
00:17:03.272 --> 00:17:04.190
Iris is close.

271
00:17:05.983 --> 00:17:06.901
I can feel it.

272
00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:12.949
Hi. thanks for coming in.

273
00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:16.577
Oh. always happy to tech consult
for Central City's finest.

274
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:21.332
Also. I am in love with the artwork
in here. Is it. uh...

275
00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:23.167
Indigenous. yes.

276
00:17:24.168 --> 00:17:25.169
It reminds me of home.

277
00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:30.800
Nice.

278
00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:34.971
So I'm guessing this is
our mystery machine.

279
00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:38.641
There was an explosion at
a halfway house downtown this morning.

280
00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:40.560
The fire department
secured this from the rubble.

281
00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:42.311
Apparently it was attached
to the water heater.

282
00:17:42.603 --> 00:17:43.521
Was anyone hurt?

283
00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:45.147
Well. that's the strange part.

284
00:17:45.439 --> 00:17:49.277
C.C.F.D. got a call about
an imminent explosion

285
00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.822
and by the time they arrived on scene.
everyone had already been evacuated.

286
00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:57.034
Then this released an energy wave
that took out the entire building.

287
00:17:58.244 --> 00:18:01.497
Damn. Folks could have died.
How many people were living there?

288
00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:03.874
Thirty-seven at the time. We got lucky.

289
00:18:05.376 --> 00:18:08.337
Halfway house staff have no idea
who led the evacuation.

290
00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:10.047
so this device is our only lead.

291
00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:14.010
I need to know what it is.
what it does and who built it.

292
00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:16.887
Well. I'm picking up traces
of radioactive particles.

293
00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:20.349
This thing was packing serious
kinetic energy before it went kaboom.

294
00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:23.519
Maybe it's some kind of...

295
00:18:25.479 --> 00:18:27.648
Some kind of. like. EMP.

296
00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:31.777
Whoa.

297
00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:34.196
That's quantum coiling.

298
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.867
Captain. whoever built this
got mad skills.

299
00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:57.345
Everything all right. Chester?

300
00:18:58.721 --> 00:18:59.555
Huh?

301
00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:03.267
Oh. yeah. Yeah. yeah. yeah.

302
00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:07.229
I'm as good as a hydrogen-phat sunrise
over Jupiter.

303
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.690
Yeah. I'm...

304
00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:15.237
I'm just. I'm going to take this back to
my workshop and do a full diagnostic.

305
00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:17.406
you know. just to make sure
that everything's totally cool.

306
00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:18.866
If that's fine.

307
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.202
Of course. I'll authorize it.

308
00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:23.412
Okay.

309
00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:26.624
Runk. are you okay?

310
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.460
Yeah. yeah. definitely.

311
00:19:30.044 --> 00:19:31.545
I'm five by five by the wayside.

312
00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:33.589
Just gonna pack up my things.

313
00:19:33.613 --> 00:19:35.613

315
00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:19.343
This can't be right. Where is she?

316
00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:24.640
What?

317
00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:28.686
Tracing that particle should have
led us right to her.

318
00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:30.604
Yeah. I know. I know. just hold on.

319
00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:36.819
Wait.

320
00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:39.196
What are you doing?

321
00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:46.912
What are you doing?

322
00:20:48.205 --> 00:20:49.039
Deon?

323
00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:52.501
We needed that to find Iris.

324
00:20:54.336 --> 00:20:55.379
Sorry. Barr.

325
00:20:56.881 --> 00:20:57.798
Gotta bounce.

326
00:21:13.022 --> 00:21:13.939
What the hell?

327
00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:29.955
I'm back home again.

328
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:33.918
With no way out.

329
00:21:41.884 --> 00:21:46.430
Shark Stadium erupted in cheers
after XS' heroic save.

330
00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:51.018
even without Impulse.
her partner in crime-fighting.

331
00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:54.980
who was too busy partying
to answer his alerts...

332
00:21:57.483 --> 00:22:00.861
Ugh! You are so disgusting!

333
00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:08.285
It is clear that XS is the most
daring speedster to appear in years.

334
00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:12.498
Good afternoon. Nora West-Allen.
How can I assist you?

335
00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:18.087
Gideon. I need another word
for "daring" that isn't too flowery.

336
00:22:18.212 --> 00:22:20.506
Of course. I have found 27-- 27--

337
00:22:21.048 --> 00:22:22.007
Gideon?

338
00:22:23.092 --> 00:22:24.009
Gideon?

339
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:25.928
Where'd you go?

340
00:22:28.097 --> 00:22:29.014
Nora.

341
00:22:30.599 --> 00:22:31.517
Nor.

342
00:22:32.142 --> 00:22:32.977
Nora.

343
00:22:43.654 --> 00:22:44.572
Nora.

344
00:22:46.532 --> 00:22:47.449
Deon?

345
00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:49.785
Is that you?

346
00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:54.707
Barry's trapped.
I can't help him. but you can.

347
00:22:54.999 --> 00:22:58.085
Well... Where? How am I...

348
00:23:01.505 --> 00:23:02.339
Uh...

349
00:23:04.884 --> 00:23:06.302
Oh. schrap.

350
00:23:20.357 --> 00:23:23.110
Iris. come on!

351
00:23:23.193 --> 00:23:25.487
This brunch reservation
ain't gonna get any later.

352
00:23:25.571 --> 00:23:27.489
Joe. don't worry.
I'll make sure we're on time.

353
00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:30.492
You guys got
any resolutions for 20227?

354
00:23:32.077 --> 00:23:32.953
I know mine.

355
00:23:34.288 --> 00:23:35.205
More family time.

356
00:23:47.092 --> 00:23:49.053
Holy schrap! Thank goodness
I found you. Dad!

357
00:23:52.181 --> 00:23:53.015
Nora?

358
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:58.687
This place is messing with me.

359
00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:03.525
Dad!

360
00:24:06.695 --> 00:24:08.364
-Nora?
-Hi.

361
00:24:10.616 --> 00:24:11.533
You're really here.

362
00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:20.250
Oh. my God.
I'm a supervillain.

363
00:24:20.626 --> 00:24:22.670
Seriously. that's what
you're worried about?

364
00:24:23.712 --> 00:24:27.299
Okay. then where's your meta-hunting
dagger or your purple head fan?

365
00:24:27.383 --> 00:24:29.176
No. I'm serious. okay?

366
00:24:29.259 --> 00:24:30.886
I'm the bad guy in all of this.

367
00:24:31.929 --> 00:24:32.888
No. you're not.

368
00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:37.476
Oh. yeah. Allegra. the microchip that
I found inside that thing was hard-wired

369
00:24:37.559 --> 00:24:41.605
with a one-of-a-kind energy converter
that I created.

370
00:24:42.523 --> 00:24:43.565
But you didn't build this one.

371
00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:44.984
So. so what?

372
00:24:45.359 --> 00:24:48.570
I still went live with the designs
on my blog last month.

373
00:24:49.196 --> 00:24:50.322
What is this. anyway?

374
00:24:50.656 --> 00:24:52.324
It's a quantum coil transformer.

375
00:24:52.408 --> 00:24:54.493
which means it's extremely powerful
and dangerous

376
00:24:54.576 --> 00:24:55.995
if used for the wrong application.

377
00:24:57.871 --> 00:24:58.747
You know what?

378
00:24:58.872 --> 00:24:59.957
You were right.

379
00:25:00.791 --> 00:25:04.044
You're right. I should have never
put my designs online.

380
00:25:07.965 --> 00:25:08.966
And never will again.

381
00:25:13.012 --> 00:25:14.722
Chuck. you're overreacting.

382
00:25:14.847 --> 00:25:16.515
Should have vetted my online posse.

383
00:25:16.807 --> 00:25:21.895
Your posse could be anyone.
but. Chuck. you inspire people.

384
00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:24.314
You don't send them to the dark side.

385
00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:25.774
Think about it.

386
00:25:26.066 --> 00:25:28.527
You said there were no casualties
because the person that built this

387
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:30.612
evacuated the place before it detonated.

388
00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:35.242
Does that sound like a supervillain
or his accomplice?

389
00:25:36.243 --> 00:25:38.078
No. Allegra. but I--

390
00:25:38.162 --> 00:25:43.208
Then. believe me when I tell you
we're missing the real story.

391
00:25:44.543 --> 00:25:46.336
And you're one of the good ones.

392
00:25:48.088 --> 00:25:51.383
So... have a little faith in yourself.

393
00:25:59.141 --> 00:26:01.018
Dad. how are we supposed
to get out of here?

394
00:26:01.643 --> 00:26:02.561
I don't know.

395
00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:07.149
You shouldn't have followed me here.
You were safer in 2049.

396
00:26:07.524 --> 00:26:09.568
But Deon told me you needed my help.

397
00:26:09.985 --> 00:26:10.861
Deon?

398
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.948
Deon's the reason I'm stuck here.

399
00:26:17.618 --> 00:26:18.702
I never should have trusted him.

400
00:26:20.662 --> 00:26:22.748
I mean. you and Mom created Deon.

401
00:26:22.831 --> 00:26:24.708
-of course you're going to trust him.
-I know.

402
00:26:26.543 --> 00:26:32.341
Joe tried telling me something was off
and I didn't listen.

403
00:26:33.801 --> 00:26:37.721
I was so focused on trying to find
your mom.

404
00:26:39.223 --> 00:26:40.349
I ignored the signs.

405
00:26:44.144 --> 00:26:47.231
She's counting on me and I.
I keep letting her down.

406
00:26:52.945 --> 00:26:54.071
I want to tell you something.

407
00:26:55.405 --> 00:26:59.368
I mean. you're going to find out
in a few decades anyways.

408
00:26:59.451 --> 00:27:04.581
but you know how
the other Nora was a CSI

409
00:27:04.665 --> 00:27:06.416
and was following in your footsteps?

410
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.003
Well. I kind of did the opposite.

411
00:27:11.755 --> 00:27:13.257
I'm a reporter.

412
00:27:15.551 --> 00:27:17.136
And even though I love it. I...

413
00:27:18.053 --> 00:27:19.304
I'm just starting out.

414
00:27:19.513 --> 00:27:23.183
And sometimes I'm. like.
"How does Mom even do this?"

415
00:27:24.685 --> 00:27:25.561
I'm proud of you.

416
00:27:26.395 --> 00:27:29.773
So you're not mad I didn't join C.C.P.D.
like you and Grandpa Joe?

417
00:27:29.857 --> 00:27:30.774
Of course not.

418
00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:32.401
I'm just...

419
00:27:33.068 --> 00:27:35.237
I'm glad you found a path
that's right for you.

420
00:27:39.032 --> 00:27:45.122
So. the thing is. is that I'm having
a really hard time

421
00:27:45.205 --> 00:27:47.207
finding my voice as a reporter.

422
00:27:48.417 --> 00:27:52.045
But Mom is teaching me
to have faith in myself.

423
00:27:52.838 --> 00:27:54.756
and listen to my instincts.

424
00:27:56.133 --> 00:27:59.052
And if she were here right now.
she'd tell you to do the same.

425
00:28:02.764 --> 00:28:06.852
And that everyone loses faith
in themselves sometimes.

426
00:28:06.935 --> 00:28:07.895
Even heroes.

427
00:28:08.979 --> 00:28:11.398
But learning how to keep
believing in yourself.

428
00:28:12.566 --> 00:28:14.943
when the whole world
is telling you the opposite.

429
00:28:16.153 --> 00:28:17.404
that's what makes a hero.

430
00:28:20.991 --> 00:28:22.534
You really are your mom's daughter.

431
00:28:22.826 --> 00:28:24.077
Well. I'm yours. too.

432
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:28.415
Maybe it's our belief in each other

433
00:28:28.498 --> 00:28:31.168
that keeps us connected
just as much as the other stuff.

434
00:28:35.005 --> 00:28:36.173
You're right.

435
00:28:37.424 --> 00:28:38.383
We are connected.

436
00:28:40.677 --> 00:28:41.929
Not just to our family...

437
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.641
Me and Iris. to the Still Force.

438
00:28:46.183 --> 00:28:48.518
It's like you said. we created it.

439
00:28:51.813 --> 00:28:55.442
Nora. I heard your voice
before you got here.

440
00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:00.405
I think somehow. just for a moment.

441
00:29:01.448 --> 00:29:04.910
I connected to the future
before it became a part of the present.

442
00:29:06.245 --> 00:29:07.246
Or the past.

443
00:29:08.288 --> 00:29:10.707
You must already have a piece
of the Still Force inside you.

444
00:29:10.832 --> 00:29:12.751
If I can figure out
how to connect to it again.

445
00:29:13.585 --> 00:29:14.920
and control it this time.

446
00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:17.631
I can get us out of here.

447
00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.899
Okay. I'm ready.

448
00:29:36.817 --> 00:29:39.611
Okay. Remember. whatever remnant
of stillness that's inside me

449
00:29:39.695 --> 00:29:40.696
won't be there for long.

450
00:29:46.994 --> 00:29:51.123
You look like Uncle Wally when he taught
Bart how to create lightning constructs.

451
00:29:51.915 --> 00:29:55.460
This is also how Wally taught me how to
make contact with the other Forces.

452
00:30:02.175 --> 00:30:03.093
Nothing's happening.

453
00:30:18.734 --> 00:30:19.985
Focus on Mom's brush.

454
00:30:20.569 --> 00:30:22.029
She still has it in the future.

455
00:30:23.071 --> 00:30:24.281
You can use it as an anchor.

456
00:30:59.024 --> 00:31:00.359
What in the world?

457
00:31:00.609 --> 00:31:02.486
In the world...
In the world...

458
00:31:05.614 --> 00:31:09.284
Barry. Nora. what are you two doing
in my living room?

459
00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.413
Grandpa Joe. you can see us?

460
00:31:13.622 --> 00:31:14.623
Plain as day.

461
00:31:15.374 --> 00:31:19.086
Only you're glowing
with some kind of green light.

462
00:31:21.338 --> 00:31:25.425
Barry. I thought you were
in the Still Force with Deon.

463
00:31:26.385 --> 00:31:28.804
Dad. whatever you're doing.
it must be working

464
00:31:28.887 --> 00:31:32.224
because if Grandpa Joe can see us. too.
the present must be stabilizing.

465
00:31:33.934 --> 00:31:35.769
Barry. can you hear me?

466
00:31:38.438 --> 00:31:39.272
Barry!

467
00:31:41.691 --> 00:31:42.609
Barry!

468
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:08.677
Grandpa Joe's gone.

469
00:32:10.095 --> 00:32:11.138
And so's the brush.

470
00:32:13.181 --> 00:32:14.266
Dad. are you okay?

471
00:32:20.355 --> 00:32:23.442
Nora. the temporal stream.

472
00:32:26.319 --> 00:32:30.740
I can feel pure Still Force energy
moving through me.

473
00:32:34.035 --> 00:32:35.287
I can see the past.

474
00:32:36.496 --> 00:32:38.290
present and future all at once.

475
00:32:39.916 --> 00:32:42.669
I can see Jesse and Harry.

476
00:32:45.255 --> 00:32:46.673
Cisco and Frost. too.

477
00:32:48.216 --> 00:32:50.218
I can see Bart's children.

478
00:32:52.387 --> 00:32:53.263
Your wife.

479
00:32:55.265 --> 00:32:56.600
Nora. you're all so happy.

480
00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:00.437
I see...

481
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:02.606
Max?

482
00:33:05.609 --> 00:33:06.610
I'm getting married?

483
00:33:07.611 --> 00:33:09.029
Who's the lucky lady?

484
00:33:09.404 --> 00:33:10.447
Actually. don't tell me.

485
00:33:10.906 --> 00:33:12.949
I can already feel the spark
inside me fading.

486
00:33:13.617 --> 00:33:14.534
Take my hand.

487
00:33:15.494 --> 00:33:17.537
This feels seriously weird.

488
00:33:19.456 --> 00:33:20.415
Let's get the hell out of here.

489
00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.213
Where's the exit in this place?

490
00:33:26.296 --> 00:33:29.716
Memorial Park. It's the only way
in and out of the Still Force.

491
00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.795
Schrap! What the hell happened?

492
00:34:07.003 --> 00:34:08.129
It's a temporal barrier.

493
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:11.007
We have to hit it with everything we got
while trying to phase through it.

494
00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:50.088
We're caught in a temporal loop.

495
00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:52.382
Dad. we're never gonna get out of here.

496
00:34:53.717 --> 00:34:57.220
You see. the past. present and future
all exist here simultaneously.

497
00:34:57.762 --> 00:34:58.680
Yes. we are.

498
00:35:00.724 --> 00:35:01.725
This isn't a time loop.

499
00:35:02.892 --> 00:35:05.353
It's the Still Force pulling us
back into the past

500
00:35:05.437 --> 00:35:06.896
every time we're about to escape.

501
00:35:07.105 --> 00:35:08.273
Well. why would it do that?

502
00:35:08.857 --> 00:35:11.651
Deon said the past. present
and future all coexist here.

503
00:35:11.735 --> 00:35:15.030
so if we've already escaped.
the only way to stop us...

504
00:35:15.614 --> 00:35:17.407
Is to keep us stuck in the past.

505
00:35:19.534 --> 00:35:22.787
Nora. use the spark I gave you
to focus on the moment

506
00:35:22.871 --> 00:35:24.497
that's already on the other side
of that barrier.

507
00:35:24.998 --> 00:35:26.374
The moment you and I get back home.

508
00:35:54.736 --> 00:35:56.571
Focus on the moment
you and I get back home.

509
00:35:58.865 --> 00:35:59.824
We get back home.

510
00:36:00.784 --> 00:36:02.369
We get back home. Home.

511
00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:03.995
Home.

512
00:36:34.567 --> 00:36:37.612
Wait. so you're telling me that you were
able to get out of there

513
00:36:38.196 --> 00:36:39.739
because you already knew you had?

514
00:36:39.823 --> 00:36:42.117
I know. it's totally surreal. right?

515
00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:47.330
Barry. is there still a spark of
the Still Force inside of you?

516
00:36:47.414 --> 00:36:51.126
Because if that's the case. then maybe
we can use that to help find Iris.

517
00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:54.713
Not anymore. I tried to tap
into it again as soon as we got back

518
00:36:54.796 --> 00:36:57.257
and I must have used every bit I had
to get us out of there.

519
00:36:58.341 --> 00:37:01.177
-We'll have to find Iris another way.
-And we will.

520
00:37:02.387 --> 00:37:05.890
You know. guys. there's one thing
that I still don't quite get.

521
00:37:07.267 --> 00:37:10.437
Barry. why would Deon
want to trap you in the past?

522
00:37:11.396 --> 00:37:12.522
Yeah. I don't know.

523
00:37:13.773 --> 00:37:15.150
I'm really worried about him.

524
00:37:18.111 --> 00:37:19.738
I better get back to 2049.

525
00:37:19.821 --> 00:37:22.115
Make sure Mom's still there
and that she's okay.

526
00:37:22.657 --> 00:37:24.826
I'm gonna miss you guys so much.

527
00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:26.953
-We're going to miss you. too.
-Sweet one.

528
00:37:27.036 --> 00:37:29.748
But you're right. we need you there
to keep our family's future safe.

529
00:37:32.876 --> 00:37:33.835
Bye.

530
00:37:37.672 --> 00:37:39.924
I miss her and Bart
more and more every day.

531
00:37:40.383 --> 00:37:41.301
Yeah.

532
00:37:42.093 --> 00:37:43.136
And my baby girl.

533
00:37:45.847 --> 00:37:48.892
Joe. about earlier.
I should have listened to you.

534
00:37:49.476 --> 00:37:51.227
You know. you were right
about everything.

535
00:37:51.644 --> 00:37:55.440
It's okay. We all stumble.
I'm just glad you picked yourself up.

536
00:37:56.858 --> 00:37:58.735
Look. there's something else.

537
00:37:59.444 --> 00:38:03.239
When I was in the Still Force
and I tapped into a tiny bit of it.

538
00:38:05.492 --> 00:38:08.578
I could feel Iris. almost see her.

539
00:38:09.329 --> 00:38:10.246
It was like a...

540
00:38:11.164 --> 00:38:15.335
A spark of stillness was
inside her. too. that I could sense.

541
00:38:15.877 --> 00:38:17.086
What do you think it means?

542
00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:23.259
I'm not sure. but somehow I know.
wherever she is right now.

543
00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.094
she's okay.

544
00:38:47.367 --> 00:38:51.913
"No problem. Just remember. you can
message me anytime you need help...

545
00:38:52.705 --> 00:38:56.501
...with a project. day or night."

546
00:38:58.294 --> 00:38:59.212
You're feeling better.

547
00:38:59.796 --> 00:39:01.673
Yeah. Yeah. Hey. you were right.

548
00:39:02.632 --> 00:39:04.008
Yeah. there was more to the story.

549
00:39:04.092 --> 00:39:08.263
And once I started digging. I remembered
where I'd seen this circuitry before.

550
00:39:10.098 --> 00:39:13.518
WookieLover77 posted this in
the comments of one of my live streams.

551
00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:16.980
He was asking the Chester Posse
for tips on renewable energy.

552
00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.899
-It was all an accident. wasn't it?
-Yeah.

553
00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:22.819
WookielLover77 volunteers
at that halfway house.

554
00:39:22.902 --> 00:39:24.320
He was just trying to provide
the residents

555
00:39:24.404 --> 00:39:27.699
with unlimited hot water
from a clean source.

556
00:39:29.117 --> 00:39:30.493
Someone's a believer again.

557
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:32.704
Thanks to you.

558
00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:34.414
You're welcome.

559
00:39:35.248 --> 00:39:40.712
So I was thinking. you know.
Marco's birthday drinks are in ten.

560
00:39:41.796 --> 00:39:44.591
How about I buy you a root beer?

561
00:39:45.466 --> 00:39:46.885
You know. to say thanks.

562
00:39:46.968 --> 00:39:49.220
And I could use one myself. actually.

563
00:39:50.096 --> 00:39:51.848
-I would love that.
-Yeah?

564
00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:33.097
It's me. Open up.

565
00:40:34.891 --> 00:40:36.309
Go away.

566
00:40:46.486 --> 00:40:47.445
Sorry about that.

567
00:40:48.655 --> 00:40:50.239
I think you're gonna want to hear
what I have to say.

568
00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.825
What is wrong with you?

569
00:40:53.117 --> 00:40:56.037
First you blow me off and now you
break into my home.

570
00:40:56.788 --> 00:40:58.373
What? I should...
I should call the Flash?

571
00:40:58.623 --> 00:41:00.708
Well. that's your choice.
Just like this one's mine.

572
00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:02.877
I'm going to help you.

573
00:41:04.879 --> 00:41:06.547
And don't worry.
I'll pay for a new lock.

574
00:41:07.674 --> 00:41:10.760
Now. you want to know why
I changed my mind?

575
00:41:12.095 --> 00:41:13.096
Because you were right.

576
00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.974
Frost and I were just starting
to build a life together.

577
00:41:16.808 --> 00:41:19.435
And thanks to her. I was finally
becoming the man that I didn't even know

578
00:41:19.519 --> 00:41:20.520
I'd always wanted to be.

579
00:41:22.021 --> 00:41:24.732
Losing her broke me.
but losing her twice...

580
00:41:26.192 --> 00:41:27.193
that'd kill me.

581
00:41:28.444 --> 00:41:29.404
That's...

582
00:41:29.946 --> 00:41:31.447
that's why I was so afraid to help you.

583
00:41:32.907 --> 00:41:33.741
So...

584
00:41:35.785 --> 00:41:37.161
If we do this.

585
00:41:38.705 --> 00:41:40.123
I need you to promise me one thing.

586
00:41:43.918 --> 00:41:44.836
We won't fail.

587
00:41:48.715 --> 00:41:49.632
We won't.

588
00:41:50.591 --> 00:41:51.551
I promise.

589
00:41:55.638 --> 00:41:56.597
Let's get to work.

590
00:41:56.621 --> 00:42:04.621
