ï»¿1
00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:09.343
The universe is on fire.

2
00:00:11.303 --> 00:00:13.805
Heat. burning.

3
00:00:14.598 --> 00:00:19.353
A perfect inferno set against
cold. endless nothing.

4
00:00:20.604 --> 00:00:24.066
But within some dimensions
there exists an aberration...

5
00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:26.610
Life.

6
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.281
I owe you a real ring.

7
00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:33.367
I love you. Ronnie.

8
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.668
I have come to end that life.

9
00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:49.633
I am Deathstorm.

10
00:00:58.475 --> 00:00:59.434
What are you?

11
00:00:59.518 --> 00:01:01.812
Complete. thanks to you.

12
00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:05.857
Now I'll return the favor.

13
00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:37.514
Get away from her!

14
00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:47.858
It's still not enough.

15
00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:52.529
But I'll be back.
and this life of yours will end.

16
00:01:57.993 --> 00:01:59.036
Caity?

17
00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:02.205
What the hell was that thing?

18
00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:04.541
I don't know.
Whatever it was.

19
00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:06.251
my lightning didn't affect it.

20
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.544
What's wrong with her?

21
00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:14.051
How do you feel?

22
00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:18.597
Lucky to be alive. So fine. I guess.

23
00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:20.807
Hold on. It burned her?

24
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:24.061
But she looks okay.
and there aren't any marks or anything.

25
00:02:24.353 --> 00:02:25.354
Let's just call it a win.

26
00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:28.982
What was that thing anyway?

27
00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:32.653
It calls itself Deathstorm.

28
00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:39.201
Like Firestorm. only...

29
00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:40.661
It wasn't Ronnie.

30
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.412
It never was.

31
00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:43.914
How do you know that?

32
00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.290
Because it told me.

33
00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:49.086
Then what exactly is it.
and where did it come from?

34
00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:52.005
I don't know. But whatever
we brought back from Piedmont Park.

35
00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:54.007
that thing. it isn't human.

36
00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:58.095
It said Ronnie's death gave him life.

37
00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.347
And when Ronnie was gone.
it became something more.

38
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.432
Something incomplete.

39
00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:06.520
And that I helped make it whole again.

40
00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:10.023
That's why it wanted you
to modify the Firestorm Matrix.

41
00:03:10.107 --> 00:03:12.484
So that I could bring it back
from whatever hell it's been hiding in.

42
00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:15.278
Barry. I'm so sorry.

43
00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:17.197
You were right this whole time.
and I wouldn't listen.

44
00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:19.533
Hey. it's okay.

45
00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:21.743
You just did what any one of us
would have done.

46
00:03:21.827 --> 00:03:24.454
No. Ronnie's been dead for seven years.

47
00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.666
And now this thing is back in his place.

48
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:29.000
all because of me.

49
00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:31.545
You're okay now
and that's all that matters.

50
00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:32.963
Barry. if Caitlin's right.

51
00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:36.466
if Deathstorm wanted Caitlin
for some creepy resurrection...

52
00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:39.428
Why is he trying to kill her now?
He got what he wanted.

53
00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:40.971
That's what we need to find out.

54
00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:44.683
Well. Chuck is using satellites to try
and figure out where this thing went.

55
00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:47.644
But if Frost is right
and it's coming back for Caity.

56
00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.271
we need to keep her safe.

57
00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:50.522
We will.

58
00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.316
And we're gonna send this thing back
to whatever hell it came from.

59
00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:58.071
How? The Cold Fusion Sphere
has been destroyed.

60
00:03:58.155 --> 00:03:59.364
We'll find another way.

61
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.491
Until then. Frost?

62
00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:02.492
I'm way ahead of you.

63
00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:05.203
If this matchhead thinks
he's getting anywhere near my sister.

64
00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:06.830
he's got to go through me first.

65
00:04:11.877 --> 00:04:14.755
Hey. I heard what happened.
How can I help?

66
00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:19.009
Thank you. But we're not even sure
what we're dealing with yet.

67
00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:20.093
Barry...

68
00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:23.180
Look. from the second
I walked into S.T.A.R. Labs.

69
00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:26.725
I could feel how worried you are.

70
00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:29.478
But what I'm sensing.

71
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:32.355
it's way more than just concern.

72
00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.610
You're hurting. Badly.

73
00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:39.738
Honey. what's going on?

74
00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:41.865
It's Iris.

75
00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:43.575
Is she okay?

76
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.076
That's just it. I don't know.

77
00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.954
What's even worse is I don't even know
where she is right now.

78
00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:50.791
What are you talking about? I thought
she was in Coast City with Sue.

79
00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:52.375
Yeah. she was. Only now--

80
00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:56.213
Oh. thank...

81
00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.923
Cecile. I... Iris is back. I gotta go.

82
00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:05.222
Iris. thank God you're back.
Sue said you'd vanished--

83
00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:06.306
No. Barry!

84
00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:09.559
What's wrong?

85
00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.147
Renee Wazzo.

86
00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.400
Tinya's mom.
I'm the last person that she touched.

87
00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:18.735
And she's...

88
00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:23.156
gone. because of me.
because of my time sickness.

89
00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:27.160
Okay.

90
00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:30.956
But then Sue said that
Tinya attacked you.

91
00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:33.959
that she made you disappear on purpose.

92
00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.794
So how did you survive?

93
00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:38.755
Your time sickness.

94
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.845
It must have pulled you into
the Still Force at that exact moment.

95
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.348
So whatever is making her sick
might have also saved her life.

96
00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.642
Okay. that's... that's freaky.

97
00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:53.436
I'm gonna give you guys some space.

98
00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:55.438
I'll be back. okay?

99
00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:05.115
Barry. what happened to Tinya's mom.
I didn't mean to--

100
00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:07.701
I know that. Look. it's gonna be okay.

101
00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:08.618
Hey.

102
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:10.328
I'm not afraid.

103
00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:17.294
What is it?

104
00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:21.381
Barry. the Still Force.
it's supposed to be a place where

105
00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:25.468
all time exists.
Past. present and future.

106
00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:27.095
But when I was there.

107
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:31.975
I saw moments from before.
even when I was a little girl up to now.

108
00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:36.646
But I didn't see my future.

109
00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:40.984
What if I don't have one anymore?

110
00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.152
You do.

111
00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:46.031
With me.

112
00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:13.600
Hello?

113
00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:18.730
Who's there?

114
00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:45.423
So. how does one summon a Force god?

115
00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:49.260
Well. I mean.
they've had appointments before.

116
00:07:49.344 --> 00:07:52.931
but usually all Iris has to do
is concentrate and Deon knows to appear.

117
00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:02.816
A few weeks ago. I gave Captain Kramer
an emergency alert to summon the Flash.

118
00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:05.318
and this is the first time
she's used it. Which means--

119
00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.821
It's serious.
As in. "you gotta go" serious.

120
00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:10.115
Yeah. but. Iris.
I can't leave you here alone.

121
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.618
Hey. she won't be.

122
00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:15.912
Yeah. No. it's okay.

123
00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:17.497
Okay. But--

124
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.250
Barry. with everything that's happening.
and now with Deathstorm.

125
00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.002
people need you more than ever.

126
00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:24.587
Go.

127
00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:33.138
Yeah. I get it.

128
00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:35.473
Waiting sucks.

129
00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:38.476
You know what might make it suck less?

130
00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:42.522
A five-course meal from Angelino's
delivered straight to your door.

131
00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:43.982
We could eat our problems away.

132
00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:46.026
Food as a distraction?

133
00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:50.113
-You're a bad influence.
-I'll take that as a yes.

134
00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:52.782
Thank you.

135
00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:54.284
You're welcome.

136
00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:58.788
A skull-faced thing flew down
from the sky and took your wife?

137
00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:01.458
Ma'am. please. try to remain calm.

138
00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.334
And nothing else was burned?

139
00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:04.669
Just the body?

140
00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:07.047
Can you describe the figure?

141
00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:09.716
A living skeleton?

142
00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:16.765
This is the tenth burn victim
in half as many months.

143
00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:18.725
and now you're saying
it's going to get even worse?

144
00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:20.852
It already has.

145
00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:25.523
Sorry to interrupt. Captain. Joe. Flash.

146
00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:29.152
But we've got three more confirmed
burn vics downtown. another two uptown.

147
00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:31.279
and at least four reported
on the Lower East Side.

148
00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:34.699
And the phones are ringing off the hook
about a skull-faced demon.

149
00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:36.743
He calls himself Deathstorm.

150
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.537
Have Matlin call in every unit
for backup.

151
00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:40.955
We need all hands on deck for this.

152
00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:41.915
Copy.

153
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.750
Glad to have you with us. Flash.

154
00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:47.837
So. why is this thing
burning people alive?

155
00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:51.007
We're not sure.
But the current theory is...

156
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.676
to feed off their grief.

157
00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:56.346
How do we fight him?

158
00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:58.098
We don't know yet.

159
00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:01.935
One thing I do know about Team Flash
is they'll find a way.

160
00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:04.229
I don't know what's more terrifying.

161
00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:06.731
that this Deathstorm
can turn up anywhere

162
00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:09.234
or that not even the Flash
is powerful enough to stop him.

163
00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:11.319
Look. Kristen.
I know this seems hopeless. but...

164
00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:13.071
It's not just that.

165
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.199
Joe. how the hell did you
use to deal with this?

166
00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:20.120
For the past 17 years.
I've been either a soldier or a cop.

167
00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:22.580
and nothing I've done
prepared me for this.

168
00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:24.541
Look. I hear you. When I was captain.

169
00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:27.210
I fought evils in this town
I didn't know existed.

170
00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:28.962
So I know exactly where you are.

171
00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:33.049
Looking out into the unknown
at something that you cannot stop.

172
00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:37.262
But I always had a friend
to watch my back.

173
00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:38.805
Just like you do now.

174
00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:40.473
Joe's right.

175
00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:43.268
Everyone has a weakness.
Deathstorm does. too.

176
00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:44.727
We just have to find it.

177
00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:47.063
Until then. what's the plan?

178
00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:49.065
I'll use my speed
to keep searching the city.

179
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.276
I can help you coordinate protocols.

180
00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:54.988
so all of our officers are safe
and they can actually do their job.

181
00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:57.615
What. are you my adviser now. Joe?

182
00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.117
That would be up to you. Captain.

183
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.954
Remember. if you or any of your officers
see this thing...

184
00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:03.872
Don't worry.

185
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.583
You'll be the first to know.

186
00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.293
I'll let you know what I find on my end.

187
00:11:10.628 --> 00:11:12.422
Have faith.

188
00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:14.424
He'll find a way.

189
00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:18.636
Until he does.
you and I have to lock down the city.

190
00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.263
Let's get to work.

191
00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:22.432
Listen up. everyone.

192
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.810
Our city is under attack.

193
00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:27.228
Captain. is it true?

194
00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:28.521
There's some kind of fire ghost?

195
00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:31.232
Yes. and I suppose
that's as good a description as any.

196
00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:34.444
To be honest.
we don't know much about our enemy.

197
00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.863
But I can confirm
that the streets aren't safe

198
00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:38.489
for anyone who is currently grieving.

199
00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:40.950
So if you've had
any upsetting news recently

200
00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:43.411
about a family member.
friend or loved one.

201
00:11:43.494 --> 00:11:46.372
please see myself or Joe immediately.

202
00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:48.124
You're not safe on the streets.

203
00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:50.627
The rest of us will be working
with the Flash and his team

204
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.128
to take this threat down together.

205
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.672
So. your orders are as follows.

206
00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:57.258
Do not engage this monster.

207
00:11:57.342 --> 00:12:01.012
We need to protect this city
by keeping civilians out of harm's way.

208
00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:03.681
The Flash and his team
will do the heavy lifting.

209
00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:05.683
Now. Martinez. Howe.

210
00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:07.310
send out a city-wide lockdown alert.

211
00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:08.811
We need everyone off the streets.

212
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.690
Korber. Matlin. gather teams
to set up a perimeter grid.

213
00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:15.652
I want eyes and ears
on every street corner we can manage.

214
00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:17.028
Anyone sees this thing.

215
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:19.155
call it in.
then get yourselves to safety.

216
00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:23.743
I have looked through all the evidence
on Deathstorm's past attacks

217
00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:25.995
and still no clues as to where he went.

218
00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:29.374
So far. every grid
has turned up nothing.

219
00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:31.542
And satellites are still a dead end.

220
00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:34.045
Hey. what about the CCC Media tip line?

221
00:12:34.128 --> 00:12:36.547
Nothing yet.
And I have the bullpen on alert.

222
00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:41.678
It's like he shows up just to feed
and then disappears into thin air.

223
00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.680
It's like a ghost.

224
00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:47.016
It's not a ghost.
so he's got to be hiding somewhere.

225
00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:50.561
Hey. How you guys doing?

226
00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:54.315
Never mind. I already know.

227
00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:56.484
I can feel your frustration
from the med lab. Chester.

228
00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:59.529
I thought that we had a way
to track these black fires.

229
00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:00.613
We did.

230
00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:04.200
But ever since our new big bad
turned from black flames

231
00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:06.953
into a fiery walking-and-talking corpse.

232
00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:09.455
he's become untraceable.

233
00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:11.082
How's Caitlin?

234
00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.294
She and Frost are moving
into the speed lab.

235
00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:17.213
Physically. Caitlin is fine.

236
00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.215
But she's still pretty shaken up.

237
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.885
Yeah. because even though
you can hide emotions.

238
00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.554
you can't get rid of them.

239
00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:30.101
Guys. we don't need the satellites
to search for Deathstorm.

240
00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:36.566
Cecile. you're going to help us
find him.

241
00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:51.289
So. wait. You want to use Cecile
as. like. a Deathstorm compass?

242
00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:54.292
Think about it.
Deathstorm absorbs grief.

243
00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.253
Grief is an emotion.

244
00:13:57.378 --> 00:13:58.379
My powers.

245
00:13:58.713 --> 00:14:02.717
My powers feel other people's emotions.
even from a distance.

246
00:14:02.925 --> 00:14:05.762
If we could figure out a way
to interface Cecile's empath powers

247
00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:07.305
with S.T.A.R.'s search systems.

248
00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:10.058
it would be like using
a wireless neurogenic array.

249
00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:13.728
synced with the med lab's
synaptic monitoring relay.

250
00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:16.773
Holy Paschal Beverly Randolph.

251
00:14:17.315 --> 00:14:18.316
Barry. this could work.

252
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.485
Yeah. but...

253
00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:23.780
syncing Cecile's mind up
with that thing.

254
00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:25.823
it sounds pretty dangerous.

255
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:27.408
Allegra's right.

256
00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:30.370
Tapping into a pool of emotion
that large.

257
00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:32.663
it could overload your neural synapses.

258
00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:36.459
You sure you're okay with this?

259
00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:41.214
This murderous bastard has
already killed more than a dozen people.

260
00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:44.550
So. yeah. try and stop me.

261
00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:50.473
I can't believe
I was so blind.

262
00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:53.684
Frost. this all my fault.
I let that thing out.

263
00:14:54.018 --> 00:14:55.770
No. I'm not going to let you go there.

264
00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:59.816
I mean. come on. we're on lockdown
because I went rogue.

265
00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:02.527
All because I was so obsessed with...

266
00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:04.570
reconnecting with the past.

267
00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:07.865
Ronnie wasn't just your past.
He was your husband.

268
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.033
And Deathstorm knew that.

269
00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:11.786
Which is why he knew he could use it
to manipulate you into bringing him back

270
00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:14.288
from whatever hellscape he comes from.

271
00:15:14.872 --> 00:15:16.499
This isn't your fault. okay?

272
00:15:16.707 --> 00:15:19.252
Isn't it? I mean. the whole city's
paying for my mistakes.

273
00:15:20.002 --> 00:15:21.421
And as stupid as it sounds.

274
00:15:22.672 --> 00:15:25.883
I... I just feel like
I lost Ronnie all over again.

275
00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:29.887
Why does this hurt so much?

276
00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:32.390
Because you loved him.

277
00:15:32.473 --> 00:15:33.683
Hmm.

278
00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:36.561
And even though it's been a long time.

279
00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:38.855
he'll always be a part of you.

280
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:40.731
and that's okay.

281
00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:01.043
- Oh. thank God.
- Oh.

282
00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:03.713
Let me guess. The Still Force?

283
00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:04.964
Call me Deon.

284
00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:07.091
My headaches. They're getting worse.

285
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.469
Okay. I... I'll see what I can do.

286
00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:12.638
You also said to tell you
if something happened.

287
00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:14.640
Well. it did.

288
00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:16.851
Ah. Tinya's mom. I already know.

289
00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:18.728
Oh. Right.

290
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.564
'Cause you can see past.
present and future.

291
00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:22.773
Not in this case.

292
00:16:23.774 --> 00:16:25.776
I actually only saw what happened
to Tinya's mom

293
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.361
once it became part of the past.

294
00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:29.822
which ain't how things
are supposed to work.

295
00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:35.453
My time sickness.
it's spreading into the Still Force.

296
00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.455
That's why it took me so long
to get to you.

297
00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:39.457
I've infected you. too. haven't I?

298
00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:41.209
It's probably why
I didn't see this coming.

299
00:16:42.126 --> 00:16:43.461
Somehow I--

300
00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:45.463
Somehow I'm getting sick. too.

301
00:16:46.797 --> 00:16:48.174
What about Tinya's mom?

302
00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:51.594
Once I get my strength back.
I'll look for her. But. Iris...

303
00:16:53.137 --> 00:16:55.973
I can see everyone's future
except for yours.

304
00:16:58.226 --> 00:17:00.311
We've got to slow down
whatever's happening.

305
00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:02.146
because if we don't...

306
00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:04.315
Iris is going to disappear again.

307
00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:07.735
Maybe for good this time.

308
00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:12.323
Okay.

309
00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:14.408
Okay. okay.

310
00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:18.162
We just...
We got to find a way to bring her back.

311
00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:21.499
because if she gets lost in space.
we need a way to find her.

312
00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:31.425
Yeah. You remember that tracking app
that you guys used to find Tinya?

313
00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:33.052
-Yeah.
-Maybe I could do the same.

314
00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:37.515
Okay. it's pretty far out.
but. I mean. if it works...

315
00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:39.100
Do it.

316
00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:02.206
I should be able to track
your movements now.

317
00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:04.041
And in the meantime. you know.

318
00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:05.751
fight as hard as you can to stay here.

319
00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:09.046
And do whatever you can
to just anchor yourself to the present.

320
00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:15.803
Yo. something's wrong.

321
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:35.072
Okay. so. I've linked up
a wireless neurogenic monitoring system

322
00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:36.407
to your cerebral cortex.

323
00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:38.451
You can do that?

324
00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:40.953
I'm pretty sure given enough time.
Chester can do anything.

325
00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:43.372
Aw. Thanks. Barr.

326
00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:45.374
So. yeah. all you need to do is

327
00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:47.877
concentrate on
any large pockets of grief.

328
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:49.211
If we're right.

329
00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:51.589
then that will lead us right to where
Deathstorm's been hiding.

330
00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:54.383
Once you get a hit.
I'll triangulate real time coordinates.

331
00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:55.843
find the location...

332
00:18:55.926 --> 00:18:57.136
Then the Flash will take over.

333
00:18:57.762 --> 00:18:58.763
Works for me.

334
00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:00.723
Are you ready?

335
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:03.934
Yeah.

336
00:19:04.393 --> 00:19:05.436
Okay.

337
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:18.783
Oh. it's working. Keep going. Cecile.

338
00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:34.632
Wait. There must be a glitch
or something. It says that...

339
00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:36.509
It's coming from S.T.A.R. Labs.

340
00:19:52.733 --> 00:19:54.110
You're wasting your time.

341
00:19:55.611 --> 00:19:57.822
You won't find me until I'm ready.

342
00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:00.991
- Shut it down now. Shut it down.
- It won't work!

343
00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:04.745
The empath and I are one.

344
00:20:07.373 --> 00:20:08.249
Deathstorm.

345
00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:11.168
If you hurt her...

346
00:20:15.589 --> 00:20:18.843
Don't bother with hollow threats.

347
00:20:19.927 --> 00:20:21.220
You can't stop me.

348
00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:27.601
The truth is. there is only one way
all of you survive--

349
00:20:27.685 --> 00:20:29.019
We're never going to give you Caitlin.

350
00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:30.646
Then I'll take her from you!

351
00:20:35.484 --> 00:20:41.407
I can taste the tiniest bits of sorrow
coming from you both.

352
00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:43.701
Mm.

353
00:20:44.118 --> 00:20:46.620
They are so delicious.

354
00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:49.498
And exactly what I need.

355
00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.083
You don't scare us.

356
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:55.379
And you can't control us anymore.

357
00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:57.381
We've already faced our grief.

358
00:20:57.715 --> 00:21:02.887
And yet. there's always
the smallest morsel left behind.

359
00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:05.973
long after the loved one has passed.

360
00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:12.772
Which is why you can't stop me.

361
00:21:22.072 --> 00:21:23.741
Cecile?

362
00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:25.409
Deathstorm!

363
00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:29.580
He overwhelmed my emotions.
It... it was...

364
00:21:30.331 --> 00:21:32.166
It was horrible.

365
00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:34.668
All that matters right now
is you're back with us.

366
00:21:35.336 --> 00:21:36.253
Okay?

367
00:21:36.462 --> 00:21:38.214
Yeah.

368
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:41.091
Barry.

369
00:21:41.759 --> 00:21:44.929
I could feel his determination.

370
00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:48.891
His sheer force of will.

371
00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:56.273
Barry. he's never. ever gonna give up
on trying to get Caitlin.

372
00:22:18.963 --> 00:22:20.005
Esperanza.

373
00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:11.682
Which would
make you his bitch.

374
00:23:12.766 --> 00:23:16.520
Be careful. prima.
The juvie in you is starting to show.

375
00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:18.480
Yeah. we're done.

376
00:23:23.193 --> 00:23:24.028
What was that?

377
00:23:24.111 --> 00:23:25.863
A localized explosion of some kind.

378
00:23:26.196 --> 00:23:28.824
Oh. if Pyro Pazuzu is back.
we could be under attack.

379
00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.912
Guys. I'm picking up a category three

380
00:23:32.995 --> 00:23:35.372
spectrum discharge
four levels beneath us.

381
00:23:35.873 --> 00:23:37.082
What could cause that?

382
00:23:37.166 --> 00:23:39.877
A light-based detonation
on the electromagnetic spectrum.

383
00:23:40.336 --> 00:23:41.211
Allegra.

384
00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:43.881
What happened?

385
00:23:44.006 --> 00:23:45.507
Barry. Watch out. that thing...

386
00:23:45.966 --> 00:23:47.509
It looks like my cousin. but it isn't.

387
00:23:50.888 --> 00:23:54.683
It was right there. One of those
grief freaks. like Chuck's dad.

388
00:23:54.767 --> 00:23:56.435
But this time it looked like Esperanza.

389
00:24:00.272 --> 00:24:03.233
I knew it wasn't my cousin
as soon as I saw it.

390
00:24:03.317 --> 00:24:06.362
But when I fired. it fired back.

391
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:08.697
The blast knocked both of us out.

392
00:24:09.657 --> 00:24:10.699
Now it's gone.

393
00:24:15.579 --> 00:24:17.039
Well. I'm just glad you're safe.

394
00:24:17.957 --> 00:24:19.458
Yeah. Yeah. me. too.

395
00:24:20.376 --> 00:24:24.797
Only why is Deathstorm
trying to haunt me all of a sudden?

396
00:24:31.428 --> 00:24:33.263
We have no idea
what happened to Deon.

397
00:24:34.515 --> 00:24:35.641
Whatever's going on with me.

398
00:24:35.724 --> 00:24:37.726
it's not just my problem anymore.

399
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.937
It's time fracturing itself.

400
00:24:40.396 --> 00:24:41.313
Okay.

401
00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:44.191
There's not much we can do
about that right now.

402
00:24:46.402 --> 00:24:49.405
But obsessing over it.
it's only gonna make things worse.

403
00:24:50.447 --> 00:24:54.618
Say. did I ever tell you about the time
that I crashed a royal wedding?

404
00:24:55.119 --> 00:24:56.120
Spoiler alert.

405
00:24:56.203 --> 00:24:58.080
they don't arrest you
if you buy the castle.

406
00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:02.584
Right. Not the time.

407
00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:04.962
More like not enough time.

408
00:25:06.296 --> 00:25:08.841
Do you know that being
married to a speedster

409
00:25:08.924 --> 00:25:12.761
affords you the ability to live
an entire day in a second?

410
00:25:14.763 --> 00:25:16.598
Makes you think that you have
all the time in the world.

411
00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:20.102
We don't.

412
00:25:22.104 --> 00:25:23.480
And every moment is precious.

413
00:25:24.273 --> 00:25:25.149
Agreed.

414
00:25:26.108 --> 00:25:28.736
You know. I used to think
that Barry and I and our children.

415
00:25:28.819 --> 00:25:30.821
that we had so much ahead of us. But...

416
00:25:33.449 --> 00:25:35.117
Now it feels like I have no future.

417
00:25:35.492 --> 00:25:37.536
Look. you are Iris West-Allen.

418
00:25:38.495 --> 00:25:40.205
You are your own force of nature.

419
00:25:40.831 --> 00:25:44.293
I promise.
whatever time this world has left.

420
00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.628
it's not done with you yet.
not by a long shot.

421
00:25:52.134 --> 00:25:53.635
Okay. Iris. stay with me.

422
00:25:55.637 --> 00:25:57.097
This time stream. it's too strong.

423
00:25:59.808 --> 00:26:01.977
Just remember what Deon said.

424
00:26:03.896 --> 00:26:07.399
Concentrate on being
right here. right now with me.

425
00:26:07.524 --> 00:26:09.026
I can't. I can't fight it.

426
00:26:09.151 --> 00:26:10.110
Hell yes. you can.

427
00:26:10.652 --> 00:26:11.653
You know why?

428
00:26:11.987 --> 00:26:14.198
Because you have
way too much to live for.

429
00:26:17.576 --> 00:26:20.496
Barry. Nora and Bart.

430
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.998
They need you. Iris.

431
00:26:23.707 --> 00:26:25.918
You're their future and they're yours.

432
00:26:26.627 --> 00:26:27.586
Are you gonna give up on that?

433
00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:29.421
-No.
-No.

434
00:26:30.422 --> 00:26:31.507
So fight this.

435
00:26:31.673 --> 00:26:33.509
You say that you can't see a future?

436
00:26:34.134 --> 00:26:35.844
Fine. anchor yourself to them.

437
00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:38.806
Write yourself a new future.

438
00:26:38.889 --> 00:26:41.350
Starting right now. You got that?

439
00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:57.533
Better?

440
00:26:58.700 --> 00:26:59.785
I'm still here.

441
00:27:00.077 --> 00:27:00.994
Yeah.

442
00:27:12.548 --> 00:27:13.632
I know that look.

443
00:27:15.259 --> 00:27:16.885
Kramer had it earlier.

444
00:27:19.221 --> 00:27:21.723
You're wondering
what to do now. too. huh?

445
00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.563
Using grief to track Deathstorm
was our best shot.

446
00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:32.651
A long time ago.

447
00:27:34.278 --> 00:27:39.241
I met someone who was
as unprepared as it gets.

448
00:27:40.576 --> 00:27:46.540
Young. inexperienced.
thrust into this whole new world

449
00:27:46.623 --> 00:27:51.420
that was sink or swim.
You know what happened?

450
00:27:53.255 --> 00:27:54.756
That he didn't see coming next?

451
00:27:56.758 --> 00:27:59.720
DeVoe. Zoom.

452
00:28:01.263 --> 00:28:04.433
Cicada. Bloodwork.

453
00:28:06.977 --> 00:28:08.395
And you're still standing. ain't you?

454
00:28:09.438 --> 00:28:10.772
What's happening now?

455
00:28:11.106 --> 00:28:14.610
Deathstorm's going after Caitlin.
I mean. how do we stop this thing

456
00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:16.695
if we don't even know
why she's the target?

457
00:28:16.778 --> 00:28:17.779
Barr.

458
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.991
all the resources. weapons
and planning in the world

459
00:28:21.074 --> 00:28:23.702
ain't going to help you prepare
for a monster like this.

460
00:28:24.786 --> 00:28:28.498
All that you can do
is be who you already are.

461
00:28:28.582 --> 00:28:32.461
Somebody willing to fight.
no matter what the odds are.

462
00:28:33.837 --> 00:28:36.465
So believe me when I say. don't worry.

463
00:28:37.966 --> 00:28:43.847
In due time. you will find a way
to get the advantage over Deathstorm.

464
00:28:44.348 --> 00:28:47.059
-And until that happens?
-You do what you do best.

465
00:28:48.727 --> 00:28:54.733
Run... into the unknown.
and trust yourself.

466
00:28:56.235 --> 00:29:00.239
Believe me. you're better prepared
than you think.

467
00:29:20.342 --> 00:29:21.260
Cait...

468
00:29:53.417 --> 00:29:56.211
Now your life ends.

469
00:30:03.385 --> 00:30:04.303
What happened?

470
00:30:04.761 --> 00:30:06.722
Deathstorm. he... he got in somehow.

471
00:30:07.347 --> 00:30:08.557
-Caitlin?
-He took her.

472
00:30:09.182 --> 00:30:10.183
What about Frost?

473
00:30:10.392 --> 00:30:11.310
Well. I scanned her vitals.

474
00:30:11.393 --> 00:30:13.895
She's still in the speed lab.
Alive. but not responding.

475
00:30:14.229 --> 00:30:16.440
Hey. Barry. I'm tracking the GPS
on Caitlin's phone.

476
00:30:16.523 --> 00:30:19.443
Deathstorm's moving with her fast.
headed to who knows where.

477
00:30:19.568 --> 00:30:21.236
If we don't catch him
before he disappears...

478
00:30:21.361 --> 00:30:22.779
Check on Frost.
I'm gonna go after Caitlin.

479
00:30:22.863 --> 00:30:23.739
Chester. stay on comms.

480
00:30:23.822 --> 00:30:25.073
Yeah.

481
00:30:33.415 --> 00:30:34.249
Found 'em.

482
00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.803
He's too high. I can't reach him.

483
00:30:47.888 --> 00:30:50.265
Chester. my boots can redirect
most energy sources.

484
00:30:50.599 --> 00:30:53.727
Does that include currents equal to
the kinetic output created when I run?

485
00:30:54.061 --> 00:30:57.064
Uh. it should. and the force
of those two equal energies

486
00:30:57.147 --> 00:30:59.066
would probably cancel each other out.

487
00:30:59.274 --> 00:31:00.609
It'd be like running into a brick wall.

488
00:31:01.318 --> 00:31:02.319
I'm counting on it.

489
00:31:02.652 --> 00:31:04.279
Hold up. Hold on.

490
00:31:04.654 --> 00:31:06.490
Are you about to do
what I think you're about to do?

491
00:31:06.615 --> 00:31:08.700
Yeah.
Time to ride the lightning.

492
00:31:50.158 --> 00:31:52.119
Chester. I've lost Caitlin.
Where'd they go?

493
00:31:52.702 --> 00:31:53.870
Uh. I don't know.

494
00:31:53.954 --> 00:31:56.415
One second you almost had them.
then they completely disappeared.

495
00:31:56.498 --> 00:31:57.499
We have to find them.

496
00:31:57.523 --> 00:31:59.523
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

497
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:16.620
If you're going to kill me.
just get it over with.

498
00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:18.622
Why would I do that?

499
00:33:18.788 --> 00:33:21.666
I traveled across the stars
to transform you.

500
00:33:21.958 --> 00:33:24.044
so you could end my loneliness.

501
00:33:25.504 --> 00:33:29.216
Because tonight. you become my bride.

502
00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.941
Uh. Flash. Caitlin just popped back up.

503
00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:49.361
She's at the Ripley's Wild World.
just outside the city.

504
00:34:03.833 --> 00:34:04.960
Caitlin. what happened?

505
00:34:06.586 --> 00:34:07.712
Where's Deathstorm?

506
00:34:09.172 --> 00:34:10.006
Caitlin?

507
00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:17.889
He said I'm not ready yet.

508
00:34:34.447 --> 00:34:35.740
It's incredible.

509
00:34:35.991 --> 00:34:39.452
All my vitals are elevated.
My blood pressure is lower

510
00:34:39.536 --> 00:34:40.620
and so is my body temperature.

511
00:34:40.704 --> 00:34:41.997
But that's not the strangest thing.

512
00:34:42.664 --> 00:34:46.626
My cells are in
a constant state of regenesis.

513
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:50.714
It's like I'm not aging at all.
at least not the way I'm supposed to be.

514
00:34:51.631 --> 00:34:54.217
Why? Why would Deathstorm
try to make you stronger?

515
00:34:55.176 --> 00:34:56.094
Ow.

516
00:34:57.095 --> 00:34:58.388
Uh. Caitlin.

517
00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:04.227
I'm sensing a massive amount of grief
inside of you.

518
00:35:04.311 --> 00:35:05.228
It's...

519
00:35:06.229 --> 00:35:07.897
It's enough for an entire family.

520
00:35:09.608 --> 00:35:12.944
When I found you at the park.
there were four more charred bodies.

521
00:35:13.653 --> 00:35:15.030
Deathstorm's calling card.

522
00:35:15.238 --> 00:35:18.199
Okay. here's what I don't get.
The black flames that he emits.

523
00:35:18.283 --> 00:35:19.534
how come they don't hurt you?

524
00:35:19.701 --> 00:35:23.830
I don't think that they're supposed to.
I think that that's what's changing me.

525
00:35:25.206 --> 00:35:27.792
When Deathstorm attacked me again.

526
00:35:27.876 --> 00:35:31.379
he said "I traveled across the stars
to be with you."

527
00:35:32.422 --> 00:35:37.218
But that my transformation wasn't
complete. that I wasn't ready yet.

528
00:35:37.719 --> 00:35:38.845
Ready for what?

529
00:35:40.221 --> 00:35:41.890
To be his bride?

530
00:35:49.189 --> 00:35:54.277
I think he wants us to be together
in wherever it is that he's from.

531
00:35:55.236 --> 00:35:59.157
And that what's happening to me now
is something that he has to do

532
00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.076
to make sure I'm prepared.

533
00:36:02.744 --> 00:36:04.120
He was never trying to Kill you.

534
00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:10.001
Barr. I know it sounds crazy.
but if Deathstorm is using the grief

535
00:36:10.085 --> 00:36:15.423
he consumes to change me
and he's saying he needs more...

536
00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:17.759
He's gonna feed again.

537
00:36:17.967 --> 00:36:20.470
And as soon as he's full.
he's gonna come back for you.

538
00:36:21.096 --> 00:36:22.013
Okay. that's it.

539
00:36:22.097 --> 00:36:24.265
I am done waiting around
for the bachelor from hell

540
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:25.600
to come give Caity a rose.

541
00:36:25.684 --> 00:36:28.269
We need to find this sicko and end him

542
00:36:28.478 --> 00:36:30.313
before he does anything worse
to my sister.

543
00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:31.940
Argh!

544
00:36:32.482 --> 00:36:33.608
- Ah.
- Hey.

545
00:36:34.442 --> 00:36:35.276
You okay?

546
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.655
It's fine. I'm gonna be okay.
I just. uh... I gotta rest.

547
00:36:41.449 --> 00:36:42.867
Frost. Cecile. stay with her.

548
00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:44.661
What are you gonna do?

549
00:36:44.786 --> 00:36:48.164
I'm going to find a way to end this.
We're more than just Team Flash.

550
00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:49.290
We're a family.

551
00:36:49.499 --> 00:36:51.292
And if anyone tries to hurt
a member of this family.

552
00:36:51.376 --> 00:36:53.128
we do whatever we can to stop them.

553
00:37:04.764 --> 00:37:07.183
Okay. Barr. So what now?

554
00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.727
Yeah. we might not have a plan.

555
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:10.812
but now we know something
we didn't before.

556
00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:12.105
Something I'm hoping can help us.

557
00:37:12.188 --> 00:37:13.148
What's that?

558
00:37:14.566 --> 00:37:16.943
Where Deathstorm goes
when he disappears.

559
00:37:17.861 --> 00:37:20.196
So. when I was chasing Deathstorm.
he opened a portal.

560
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.533
And even though I couldn't get
to Caitlin. I saw inside of it.

561
00:37:23.992 --> 00:37:25.034
Just for a moment.

562
00:37:25.744 --> 00:37:28.455
And guys. I've seen
space like that before.

563
00:37:30.999 --> 00:37:33.418
Inside your singularity.
right before you joined the team.

564
00:37:35.044 --> 00:37:36.087
Oh. no.

565
00:37:36.671 --> 00:37:38.757
So what this means
is when Deathstorm disappears.

566
00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.592
he's not just teleporting around town.

567
00:37:41.509 --> 00:37:44.929
No. he is jumping back and forth
between points in dimensional space.

568
00:37:45.054 --> 00:37:47.015
I think I know what happened now.

569
00:37:51.311 --> 00:37:54.856
When Ronnie's grief traveled
through that singularity.

570
00:37:56.649 --> 00:37:58.276
it created Deathstorm.

571
00:38:02.238 --> 00:38:03.448
Only he's been trapped there.

572
00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:08.453
trying to get back across the stars
to Caitlin ever since.

573
00:38:08.536 --> 00:38:10.955
And now that he's complete.
he can move back and forth between

574
00:38:11.039 --> 00:38:14.209
that hell dimension and here. at will.

575
00:38:14.417 --> 00:38:18.004
All this time. we've been wondering why
Deathstorm would come after Caitlin

576
00:38:18.087 --> 00:38:19.547
seven years after Ronnie died.

577
00:38:19.881 --> 00:38:22.175
He's been searching for his plus-one
this whole time.

578
00:38:22.342 --> 00:38:25.011
It took him this long
because of how far he had to travel.

579
00:38:25.261 --> 00:38:29.390
So. a death monster
from another dimension.

580
00:38:29.516 --> 00:38:30.975
traveling through outer space

581
00:38:31.059 --> 00:38:33.728
to find his death bride.
Yeah. it's official.

582
00:38:33.812 --> 00:38:35.563
I've heard everything now.

583
00:38:36.064 --> 00:38:38.233
Great Benjamin Banneker.

584
00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:41.361
Trans-dimensional particles.

585
00:38:42.445 --> 00:38:44.197
Okay. now you're just making stuff up.

586
00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.740
No. no. no. look. now that I know

587
00:38:45.824 --> 00:38:48.576
that his powers
are literally from out of this world.

588
00:38:50.161 --> 00:38:51.996
it makes me think
that we need something cosmic.

589
00:38:52.622 --> 00:38:55.333
And folks. I know just the gadget
that we can augment

590
00:38:55.458 --> 00:38:57.460
and use to defend ourselves
against this thing.

591
00:39:01.548 --> 00:39:03.132
The Mental Augmentation Chamber.

592
00:39:03.216 --> 00:39:06.135
The MAC saved my ass
by absorbing the entire mass

593
00:39:06.219 --> 00:39:10.723
of black hole energy that I accidentally
unleashed a couple years ago.

594
00:39:10.807 --> 00:39:11.850
I'm sorry about that again.

595
00:39:12.517 --> 00:39:15.687
And black holes are composed
of trans-dimensional particles.

596
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:18.439
Exactly. Now. this is
going to sound a little nuts.

597
00:39:18.982 --> 00:39:23.444
But what if we adjust the MAC
so that instead of absorbing

598
00:39:23.611 --> 00:39:27.448
trans-dimensional energy.
it emits cosmic craziness instead.

599
00:39:27.532 --> 00:39:29.284
We'd finally be able
to fight fire with fire.

600
00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:30.285
Yeah.

601
00:39:31.578 --> 00:39:34.455
Yeah. but it's not like
we can just turn the MAC

602
00:39:34.539 --> 00:39:36.791
into a portable cannon or shield.

603
00:39:38.918 --> 00:39:40.587
What we would really need is...

604
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:43.631
A person to contain all the energy.

605
00:39:44.424 --> 00:39:45.967
Done and donner.

606
00:39:48.261 --> 00:39:50.346
Look. I don't speak geek.
but I understand enough to realize

607
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:54.267
that you guys need an anti-Deathstorm
in order to take down the real thing.

608
00:39:54.642 --> 00:39:58.229
Frost and Deathstorm's powers
are both based on cold fusion.

609
00:39:58.855 --> 00:40:01.149
That could be the key
to pull this whole thing off.

610
00:40:01.482 --> 00:40:03.651
Yeah. but Frost. this is right up there

611
00:40:03.735 --> 00:40:06.279
with some of the most dangerous stuff
we've ever attempted as a team.

612
00:40:06.821 --> 00:40:08.239
We can't ask you to do this.

613
00:40:08.823 --> 00:40:11.826
You don't have to. It's like I told Mom.

614
00:40:12.285 --> 00:40:15.121
Dad created me for one reason.
to keep Caity safe.

615
00:40:16.205 --> 00:40:17.999
I was literally born for this.

616
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.717
So. let's extinguish the son of a bitch.

617
00:41:26.734 --> 00:41:27.694
Iris.

618
00:41:29.904 --> 00:41:30.780
Thank God.

619
00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:36.911
It's so good to see you.

620
00:41:36.935 --> 00:41:44.935
