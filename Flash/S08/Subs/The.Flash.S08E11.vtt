00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:12.095
-Sorry.
-I'm sorry. I should...

2
00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.639
-Excuse me.
-Dr. Snow?

3
00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.974
Yes. Thank goodness they finally
sent someone to fix the sink.

4
00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:17.434
It's been leaking for weeks.

5
00:00:17.768 --> 00:00:19.186
Yeah. I don't know anything
about a sink.

6
00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.438
I was hoping that you could fix that.

7
00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:23.815
Oh! Uh. yes. yes. of course.

8
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.692
Have a seat on the bed.

9
00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:27.027
Thank you.

10
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.820
I'm normally really careful.

11
00:00:28.904 --> 00:00:31.949
but. uh. Dr. Wells has this thing
about deadlines and...

12
00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:32.866
Ah.

13
00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:35.285
I guess I was pushing things a little.

14
00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:37.329
How does it look. doc?

15
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:40.165
Uh... it's not so bad.

16
00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:43.669
Probably just a superficial
second degree burn.

17
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.128
I think you'll be okay.

18
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.090
I know what you mean
about Dr. Wells. though.

19
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.842
But... He's brilliant.

20
00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:54.096
So. uh. how did this happen?

21
00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.808
I was fitting a high pressure coil
down in The Pipeline and. uh...

22
00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.685
Well. you'd think
that a structural engineer

23
00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:02.271
would know not to touch one
without protection but...

24
00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:04.815
-Sorry.
-Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

25
00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.650
It's fine. It's fine. Doesn't even hurt.

26
00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.152
I'm fine. Mm. it's fine.

27
00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:10.070
Mm.

28
00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:12.573
What do you think? Am I going to live?

29
00:01:12.823 --> 00:01:14.116
I think so.

30
00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:16.285
So. um...

31
00:01:17.286 --> 00:01:18.704
What's it like in The Pipeline?

32
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:21.999
I mean. working inside it.

33
00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:24.543
On it? Sorry.

34
00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.588
It just... It must be incredible
to wake up every morning

35
00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:29.339
knowing that you're building something

36
00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:33.302
that's gonna change the course
of scientific discovery for generations.

37
00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:34.595
Yeah. I'm...

38
00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:37.306
I mean. I guess I never really
thought of it that way. I just...

39
00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:39.099
I just build things.

40
00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:41.310
Ridiculously complicated things.
mind you.

41
00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:42.853
But at the end of the day.

42
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.731
it's kinda like I'm a big kid.

43
00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:50.027
Instead of LEGOs.
I'm using concrete and steel.

44
00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:53.822
I used to love those things
when I was a little girl.

45
00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:54.990
Yeah. me. too.

46
00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:57.451
I mean. not when I was a little...
little girl.

47
00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:59.328
You're right.

48
00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:01.455
And what we're doing down there. um...

49
00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.624
Being a part of it is really incredible.

50
00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:07.210
I guess that makes us all
kind of special.

51
00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.632
Well. I think you're good to go.

52
00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:14.426
Good as new. thank you.

53
00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:17.638
-Dr. Snow...
-It's Caitlin.

54
00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:21.642
Caitlin. nice to meet you.

55
00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:22.601
I'm Ronnie.

56
00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:23.852
Nice to meet you. Ronnie.

57
00:02:28.065 --> 00:02:29.066
Come back anytime.

58
00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:32.694
It's nice to know that
you'll always be there to fix me up.

59
00:02:34.446 --> 00:02:35.364
It's nice to know that

60
00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:37.616
you'll always be there to fix me up.

61
00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:41.620
Ronnie? How's it possible?

62
00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.123
Join me. Help us... Come together.

63
00:02:45.207 --> 00:02:47.209
Together? I don't understand.

64
00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:51.213
Not whole without you... You save us...

65
00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:52.714
How?

66
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:56.009
Memories in the snow...

67
00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.136
Ronnie. wait. please.

68
00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.930
Tell me how to save you.

69
00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:26.957
Oh. my God. What did I do?

70
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.458
What happened to my mom?

71
00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.043
Iris?

72
00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:31.420
Where's my mom?

73
00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:32.671
I don't know.

74
00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:34.339
Just tell me what happened!

75
00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:38.677
Okay. you need to back up right now.

76
00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:40.220
What is wrong with her?

77
00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:42.305
She has a... It's a condition. okay?

78
00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.807
It's really hard to explain.

79
00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:47.644
But basically. when it flares up
like it is right now. she loses time.

80
00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:49.312
It's not her fault.
She can't control what happens next.

81
00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.440
No. you're lying to me.
She attacked my mom.

82
00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:52.899
Tinya. I am so sorry.

83
00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:55.110
I'm calling Barry.

84
00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.614
What the hell?

85
00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:04.953
You need to get out of here.

86
00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:06.955
Now!

87
00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:11.293
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

88
00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:19.176
Colin Smith. Megan Landa.
Veronica Binning.

89
00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:23.597
These are potential victims that
Cecile and I got from Kramer's files.

90
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.309
They all were killed in a fire
of undetermined origin

91
00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:28.518
in the last six months.

92
00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:31.897
That's way before the deaths
of Stan Mullen and our other vics.

93
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.898
We know.

94
00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:36.026
Which is why I reached out to
the families of all of our new victims

95
00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.487
to find out
if any of them were dealing with grief.

96
00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:42.365
Now. Megan and Colin
both recently lost a parent.

97
00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.702
and Veronica has a sister
who died when they were kids.

98
00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:48.705
Looks like our not-so-friendly fire
has been snacking on people's grief

99
00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:50.332
a lot longer than we thought.

100
00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:52.000
It's been ahead of us all along.

101
00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.168
Not anymore.

102
00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.295
Now we have a way
to stop it from killing.

103
00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.173
Yeah. I finished encoding
the Cold Fusion Sphere

104
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.510
with Frost and Dr. Tannhauser's
cryokinetic RNA signatures.

105
00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:03.220
Next time there's a barometric anomaly.

106
00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:07.265
we can bring it out into the field and.
you know. use it to capture this thing.

107
00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.684
I just wish we knew
where it was going to pop up next.

108
00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:13.021
There's got to be something we're still
missing that links all the victims.

109
00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:17.275
-We find that connection...
-We can figure out what this fire wants.

110
00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:18.652
It wants me.

111
00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:22.364
And I know that because I just saw it.

112
00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:24.032
But why?

113
00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:25.784
What does it want with you?

114
00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:29.079
Parker?

115
00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:31.122
Wait. you know her?

116
00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:33.208
Yeah. she's my yoga instructor.

117
00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:35.085
You recognize anyone else?

118
00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:36.336
Um...

119
00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:38.964
These two.

120
00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:42.217
They were at O'Shaughnessy's the night
Frost and I went on our double date.

121
00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.678
and I recognize them as well.

122
00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:48.098
Oh. we were all at
a biochem conference together.

123
00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:51.101
We were panelists
on an applied sciences lecture.

124
00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:54.604
It's been looking for me
this whole time.

125
00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:58.525
That still doesn't explain
why the fire's coming after you.

126
00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:02.779
Because the fire is Ronnie.

127
00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:04.823
And he wants me to save him.

128
00:06:14.291 --> 00:06:18.128
I know how this sounds.
but it spoke to me.

129
00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:22.173
It was confused and jumbled.
but it was him.

130
00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:23.508
It was Ronnie.

131
00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:25.093
Caitlin. this fire...

132
00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:28.054
You know.
it can get inside people's heads.

133
00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:31.391
show you people you've lost.
like it did with Chester's dad.

134
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.979
Are you sure it didn't just
want you to think it was Ronnie?

135
00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.689
I wasn't sure at first.

136
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.444
but that's why I downloaded the data
from when the fire was in the MCCU.

137
00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:45.530
This is cold fusion radiation.

138
00:06:45.614 --> 00:06:48.325
But these readings
are 10 to the negative 28th watts.

139
00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:50.911
That's Hawking radiation.

140
00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:54.456
You can only pick up rads like that
from inside a Singularity.

141
00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:56.875
Ronnie died in a Singularity.

142
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.046
On our wedding day.

143
00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:06.593
The only way to close it was to merge
the inner and outer horizons.

144
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.597
Right. Ronnie and Professor Stein
came together. made Firestorm

145
00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:12.933
and separated in that thing.

146
00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:19.689
Ronnie... Professor...

147
00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:22.609
No!

148
00:07:26.655 --> 00:07:27.781
Only Ronnie didn't make it.

149
00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:31.868
Right. But matter cannot be created
or destroyed. only changed.

150
00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:34.496
So. maybe Ronnie is still alive.

151
00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:37.749
I mean. maybe the pressure
from when the horizons merged

152
00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:41.002
broke down his biological matter
into pure thermodynamic energy.

153
00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:43.505
And that could account for
the radiation.

154
00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:46.049
but it still doesn't explain
why the fire's been killing people.

155
00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.384
Why it tortured Chester.

156
00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:50.637
And if Ronnie knew what he was doing.
he would hate it.

157
00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:53.348
Which is why I don't think
he's in control.

158
00:07:53.974 --> 00:07:57.477
When Ronnie died.
his brain was flooded with ACTH.

159
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.981
It's the hormone the human brain creates
when it experiences grief.

160
00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:04.317
So maybe when he was reborn
as a sentient fire.

161
00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:05.694
that same process gave him

162
00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:07.946
an overwhelming attraction
to the same hormone.

163
00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:13.910
So he's been eating people's grief
because of some primal urge?

164
00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:16.663
I think he needs it to survive.
which is why he's been trying

165
00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:18.206
to reconnect with me so I can help him.

166
00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:19.541
Did he say anything else?

167
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.126
Uh. a few words.

168
00:08:21.418 --> 00:08:22.794
"Joining. togetherness."

169
00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:25.463
I think he was trying to get me
to remember something.

170
00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:27.841
The Quantum Splicer?

171
00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:31.553
It's what made him Firestorm
in the first place.

172
00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:35.098
I think if we can use it
to make Ronnie human again.

173
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:36.933
his mind will regain control.

174
00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:38.476
And the killings will stop.

175
00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:43.189
Even if you are right about this.

176
00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:45.442
the Splicer needs two people to work.

177
00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:47.444
and we can't ask anybody to volunteer.

178
00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:48.403
It's too dangerous.

179
00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.947
Yeah. but we wouldn't need
another person

180
00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:53.283
if we used one
of Eva McCulloch's R-CEM chips.

181
00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:56.202
Because if we fuse
one of Eva's chips to the Splicer.

182
00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:58.913
it will do all the heavy lifting
by duplicating Ronnie's cells

183
00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:00.707
and coalescing another body form. right?

184
00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.083
Like it did with Caity and me.

185
00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:04.210
Okay. but raising the dead?

186
00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.129
That's intense. even for us.

187
00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:08.173
It turned out okay for Lazarus. right?

188
00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:10.925
And if Chester and Caitlin both think
it might work...

189
00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:12.302
It makes sense.

190
00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:15.388
Ronnie is just trying to help us
help him come home.

191
00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:17.140
All we have to do is listen.

192
00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:18.725
What are we waiting for?

193
00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:20.393
I'll get the Quantum Splicer.

194
00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:22.645
I'll grab an R-CEM chip from Starchives.

195
00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:31.321
Hey.

196
00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:34.783
Things are moving pretty fast.

197
00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:37.786
Not for Ronnie. who knows how long
he's been trapped like that?

198
00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:40.997
All I'm saying is.
let's not jump to conclusions

199
00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:42.582
about everything that's been happening.

200
00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:44.667
You know. maybe we just slow down.

201
00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:46.920
Make sure we're doing the right thing.

202
00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:50.256
Saving my husband is the right thing.

203
00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:55.220
Okay. if you want.
we can check the radiation data.

204
00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:57.388
It's not the science I'm worried about.

205
00:09:57.889 --> 00:10:00.767
This fire can manipulate people.
If it wants you to use the Splicer--

206
00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.020
If I don't. Ronnie will be
burning like that forever.

207
00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:05.814
And I can't let that happen.

208
00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.691
Look.
I know what you're thinking.

209
00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:10.819
That I mourned his death for so long

210
00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:12.987
that I would do anything
to get him back.

211
00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:16.407
But Ronnie is alive.

212
00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:18.326
I... I can feel it. It's him.

213
00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.328
And he wants us to help him.

214
00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:24.874
I'm going to take this to Chester. so he
can get started on the modifications.

215
00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:29.420
What is it?

216
00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:30.839
Marcus.

217
00:10:32.715 --> 00:10:36.094
He has no idea what happened
and he deserves to know.

218
00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:38.012
What are you gonna tell him?

219
00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:40.348
The truth.

220
00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:48.731
So you're saying that
for the last eight years

221
00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:51.276
you've been working with The Flash

222
00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:54.529
and now your dead husband's
come back to life?

223
00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:56.072
Yeah.

224
00:10:56.447 --> 00:11:00.368
Yeah. yeah. that's kind of
out of my. uh. wheelhouse.

225
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.705
I know. And I just want to make sure
you're staying safe.

226
00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:09.294
Ronnie has been unconsciously
hurting the people around me.

227
00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:11.921
And you think I'm next on the list.

228
00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:14.716
I'm so sorry
for dragging you into this...

229
00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:19.762
but for your safety. I think.

230
00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:25.018
we should stop seeing each other
just until I get Ronnie back.

231
00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:26.811
And then what happens?

232
00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:30.899
-The killings will stop.
-No. no. I meant what happens with us.

233
00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:36.112
Marcus. my last few relationships
have not been exactly healthy.

234
00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:41.159
That's why I'd given up on finding
a meaningful connection with someone

235
00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:42.994
until I met you.

236
00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:46.998
and you showed me that
when I go all in with us--

237
00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:49.709
Look. Caitlin. please.

238
00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:51.336
I'm not an idiot.

239
00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:52.629
There is no more us.

240
00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:55.548
And I've been broken up with before.

241
00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:58.176
It's just never due to resurrection.

242
00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:00.053
Yeah. that's a... That's a new one.

243
00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:09.020
But it's your decision. I guess.
and I'll respect that.

244
00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:11.564
I'm so sorry.

245
00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:14.943
Yeah. me. too.

246
00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:18.780
Um...

247
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:23.826
You know. there's this quote from Plato
that's always stuck with me.

248
00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:27.747
He said that plants grow
their roots towards the earth.

249
00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:31.042
But people. we're heavenly plants.

250
00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:34.295
meaning that our roots.
they grow upward.

251
00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:36.673
Towards our heart.

252
00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:42.387
But those roots. they need to be
cared for. tended. like any plant.

253
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:46.516
Or your heart will break.

254
00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:48.977
before it even has a chance to grow.

255
00:12:52.855 --> 00:12:53.731
Goodbye. Caitlin.

256
00:12:58.486 --> 00:12:59.445
Yeah. bye.

257
00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:13.418
What are you doing down here?

258
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.130
I'm making sure your RNA
is integrated into the Sphere.

259
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.757
It's still the only way
to stop the flames.

260
00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:22.343
Not anymore. We save Ronnie.

261
00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:24.387
we can chuck that Time Sphere
in the trash.

262
00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.474
Come on. I thought you were
all about "trusting your team" now.

263
00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:30.226
I am. Caitlin's...

264
00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:33.521
Just so excited
about getting Ronnie back.

265
00:13:33.604 --> 00:13:36.691
it feels like she's ignoring
all the warning signs.

266
00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:40.903
Frost. if this was really Ronnie.

267
00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:43.156
why is he coming back now?

268
00:13:43.614 --> 00:13:47.452
-Seven years after he died.
-l don't know.

269
00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:49.746
Neither do I.

270
00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:55.168
-This just all feels...
-Too good to be true?

271
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.088
You're checking on the Sphere.

272
00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:01.132
You're worried about her. too.

273
00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:03.509
Maybe. but I can't start
fighting with her again.

274
00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:05.178
I mean. not after yesterday.

275
00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:06.804
She helped Mom and me.

276
00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:09.640
Got to have her back now.

277
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.435
So what? We just let her
go through with this?

278
00:14:14.437 --> 00:14:15.396
What if it was Iris?

279
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.067
And there was some dangerous experiment
that would cure her time sickness?

280
00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:20.943
You'd risk everything to save her.

281
00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:26.491
So even if this fails. we at least
owe her the chance to try.

282
00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:34.916
Yo. it's me
Your boy Chester ♪

100% for free. free. free. free...

285
00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:41.756
You should sell merch. you know?

286
00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:45.968
Like shirts that say.
"What up. Party People!"

287
00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:46.928
Like all the way around.

288
00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:49.680
All the way around? Yeah. that was good.
I'm gonna steal that idea.

289
00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:52.183
Wow. You really are
blowing up the Internet.

290
00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:54.560
Oh. just wait
till my next episode. girl.

291
00:14:56.979 --> 00:15:00.066
Hold on. You're not sharing the specs
for this online. are you?

292
00:15:01.025 --> 00:15:04.278
Uh. yeah. live broadcast. You know.

293
00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:09.700
But then someone
could actually build it on their own.

294
00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:11.786
Yeah. that's the point.

295
00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:15.456
Allegra. did you know that WookieLover77

296
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.668
built an entire fleet of drones
based on my last Al algorithm?

297
00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:22.713
And now those same drones
are delivering supplies to folks

298
00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.882
who need them in impoverished countries.

299
00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:28.219
That's what the whole
Chester P. community is all about.

300
00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:33.349
Shout out to WookielLover77.
saving the world one drone at a time.

301
00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.601
And that's great.

302
00:15:37.311 --> 00:15:39.397
But the Splicer isn't a drone.

303
00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:43.151
And putting technology like this
out there. it could be dangerous.

304
00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:45.278
What if it lands in the wrong hands?

305
00:15:45.903 --> 00:15:48.239
I'm pretty sure supervillains
have better things to do

306
00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:50.491
than watch my broadcast.

307
00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:53.453
No. Worse things. I guess.

308
00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:57.790
You still might want to check yourself.
depending on the science.

309
00:15:58.499 --> 00:16:02.170
But that goes against the whole purpose
of scientific discovery.

310
00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:04.464
What good is knowledge
if you don't share it?

311
00:16:05.506 --> 00:16:08.718
Allegra. having access to
a breakthrough like this

312
00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:11.429
could help one of my viewers
better understand the laws of physics.

313
00:16:11.512 --> 00:16:14.724
which could lead to who knows
what kind of innovation

314
00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:16.517
and make the world a better place.

315
00:16:16.767 --> 00:16:19.770
Hell. if someone could see this.
and be inspired enough

316
00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:23.816
to land a breakthrough in the cosmology
of our body's atoms

317
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.652
or maybe even discover the... the...
the true nature

318
00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:29.947
of what human consciousness
really is or. you know...

319
00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:33.701
Or how to resurrect the dead.

320
00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:45.796
Chuck. all I'm saying
is maybe all knowledge

321
00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.966
shouldn't always be
so readily available.

322
00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:51.177
'Cause you think most people are bad.

323
00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:52.428
No.

324
00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:56.807
Because I know most people aren't you.

325
00:16:57.808 --> 00:17:03.314
And maybe they shouldn't be able
to resurrect the past on a whim.

326
00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:09.237
Last year. I watched Esperanza
die in my arms.

327
00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:16.744
Death shouldn't be
some kind of science experiment.

328
00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:20.331
It's a part of life. and it's finite.

329
00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:25.086
It's what my abuelita used to call
noche mas negra...

330
00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:27.630
The blackest night.

331
00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:32.051
Yeah.

332
00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:36.556
I'll keep this one offline.

333
00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:40.560
But. hey. think about that merch.

334
00:17:43.354 --> 00:17:45.856
-I'll take a small.
-I got you.

335
00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:47.775
Okay.

336
00:17:47.799 --> 00:17:49.799
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

337
00:18:10.923 --> 00:18:15.011
Where is she? Where is she?

338
00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:23.436
Where is she?

339
00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:33.613
Where is Caitlin?

340
00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:36.782
Must be free.

341
00:18:37.491 --> 00:18:41.120
Pain... Set me free...

342
00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:45.041
Help... Free mel

343
00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:50.546
Cecile. Hey.

344
00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:53.424
What happened?

345
00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:57.803
The fire...

346
00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:04.310
-It spoke to me.
-It's here?

347
00:19:04.935 --> 00:19:05.978
No.

348
00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:08.564
No.

349
00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:09.815
But...

350
00:19:10.858 --> 00:19:15.321
Wherever it is.
it... it connected with my mind.

351
00:19:16.864 --> 00:19:19.241
Barry. the pain.

352
00:19:20.284 --> 00:19:23.329
-The pain. there was so much of it.
-And Ronnie?

353
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:25.873
Did you feel him. too?

354
00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:30.920
Yeah. I could sense his anguish.

355
00:19:33.464 --> 00:19:35.216
It felt like he was begging me.

356
00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:38.552
-To do what?
-To set him free.

357
00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:43.516
Barry. I don't think that Ronnie
wants to be brought back.

358
00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:46.977
I think that he wants to die.

359
00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:52.608
It's impossible.

360
00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:55.945
Look. I know how hard
this must be to hear. but.

361
00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.240
I'm almost positive about what I felt.

362
00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:03.119
Caitlin. Ronnie doesn't want
to be brought back.

363
00:20:03.744 --> 00:20:05.204
He asked me to save him.

364
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.999
Maybe that's why
Ronnie went after Cecile.

365
00:20:09.083 --> 00:20:11.794
He knew he could communicate through her
to tell us the truth.

366
00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:13.671
He's not here for Cecile.

367
00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:14.964
He's been looking for me.

368
00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:16.924
From what I can tell.

369
00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:21.095
Ronnie is in agony

370
00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:23.264
inside that fire.

371
00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:26.100
It's like it's eating him alive.

372
00:20:26.183 --> 00:20:28.602
It's torturing his mind.

373
00:20:30.521 --> 00:20:32.523
Caitlin. It's like Ronnie is in hell.

374
00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:37.445
And I truly believe
that he came to us for help.

375
00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:43.033
-It's so that we can end his suffering.
-And we will.

376
00:20:43.784 --> 00:20:47.163
It's why we're modifying
the Quantum Splicer to help him.

377
00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:49.832
because I know that's what
he would want.

378
00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.250
What if Cecile's right?

379
00:20:52.209 --> 00:20:53.169
She's the only one

380
00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:56.297
that's been able to form
a true connection to the fire.

381
00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:59.258
I'm connected to it
because I'm its wife.

382
00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:01.051
Why can't you understand that?

383
00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:03.304
I mean. if anyone knows what it wants.
it would be me.

384
00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:04.638
You're right.

385
00:21:05.723 --> 00:21:12.396
You were. You are the most
important thing in Ronnie's life.

386
00:21:14.231 --> 00:21:17.234
Caitlin. maybe it's time
that you consider how he feels.

387
00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:21.238
Barry. you knew Ronnie.

388
00:21:22.156 --> 00:21:25.701
He was a part of this team and you knew
he'd do anything to get back to me.

389
00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.579
We have a way to help him.

390
00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.956
Why are you so against this?

391
00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:33.959
Because when I had
a chance like this once.

392
00:21:34.418 --> 00:21:37.546
when I went back.
to save my mom from Thawne.

393
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.383
I did it because I was trying
to recreate a perfect past.

394
00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:42.885
but it was a lie.

395
00:21:43.344 --> 00:21:45.179
And it all came crashing down in the end

396
00:21:45.262 --> 00:21:47.431
because I refused to see
the warning signs.

397
00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:48.974
because I didn't listen to my friends.

398
00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:49.892
or my family.

399
00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:54.355
We can't resurrect the past.

400
00:21:55.898 --> 00:21:56.941
It's too dangerous.

401
00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:59.109
This is not another Flashpoint.

402
00:21:59.193 --> 00:22:00.861
We are not creating another timeline.

403
00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:03.572
We are saving my husband
from a nightmare.

404
00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:06.492
Then maybe it's time to help him let go.

405
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:11.539
I thought family was supposed to have
your back. no matter what.

406
00:22:12.873 --> 00:22:16.085
Even when they think
you're making the wrong choice.

407
00:22:18.212 --> 00:22:21.423
God knows. we've all fallen in line for
you and Iris on more than one occasion.

408
00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:22.842
Caitlin. please.

409
00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:26.387
If you won't help me.
I'll save him on my own.

410
00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:41.777
Oh. yeah. that's my kinda breakfast.

411
00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:42.820
Good. You're awake.

412
00:22:42.945 --> 00:22:44.530
Barely. I haven't been up this early

413
00:22:44.613 --> 00:22:47.074
since Cisco made me wait in line
for the new Call of Duty.

414
00:22:48.617 --> 00:22:49.493
Are we going somewhere?

415
00:22:49.702 --> 00:22:51.704
I thought I'd surprise you
for our anniversary.

416
00:22:52.413 --> 00:22:54.707
Okay. It's too early for this. Spill it.

417
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:55.624
Okay.

418
00:22:56.292 --> 00:22:59.295
I thought we could use a weekend away.
Maybe. get outside of the city.

419
00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:00.796
Go visit Mapleville...

420
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.132
-Oh. okay. I remember that place...
-Mm-hmm.

421
00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:04.967
...where we had our first weekend
away together.

422
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:09.471
Which is why I booked us a room at the
same bed and breakfast for a few nights.

423
00:23:09.555 --> 00:23:13.267
Oh. yes! You remember that. uh.
seafood joint on the corner?

424
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:15.311
-We have to go back there.
-I do. and we will.

425
00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:17.146
Just as soon as you get ready.

426
00:23:17.396 --> 00:23:18.606
Come on. we got to get on the road.

427
00:23:18.731 --> 00:23:21.567
It's a five-hour drive and I wanna
be there in time to check in.

428
00:23:21.734 --> 00:23:23.402
check out the glass-blowing exhibit.

429
00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:25.946
Hold on. When exactly
did you have time to plan all this?

430
00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.699
I know. We've been so busy
with the particle accelerator.

431
00:23:29.033 --> 00:23:30.910
but I thought it was important
to celebrate us.

432
00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.120
and the fact that we've been together
a whole year.

433
00:23:33.203 --> 00:23:35.664
A year. Yeah.
it's been pretty great year.

434
00:23:35.748 --> 00:23:37.666
- You think?
- I do.

435
00:23:38.334 --> 00:23:41.670
We're like two atoms sharing
a strong covalent bond.

436
00:23:41.754 --> 00:23:43.672
Ooh. I love it
when you talk science to me.

437
00:23:47.593 --> 00:23:48.427
Hmm.

438
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.179
-Okay. now go. Get ready.
-Okay. I'm going.

439
00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:52.348
I'm going. I'm going.
I'm going. I love you. Cait.

440
00:24:03.859 --> 00:24:06.236
Thank God you're okay.

441
00:24:14.745 --> 00:24:15.788
Where's Tinya?

442
00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.498
Well. I told her to stay away.

443
00:24:17.998 --> 00:24:19.667
Your time sickness is going ballistic.

444
00:24:19.875 --> 00:24:21.502
I figured it'd be better
to keep her safe.

445
00:24:22.252 --> 00:24:23.545
Yeah. thank you.

446
00:24:25.381 --> 00:24:28.050
Look. Sue. what happened
to Tinya's mom...

447
00:24:28.926 --> 00:24:29.843
I didn't mean to.

448
00:24:30.052 --> 00:24:31.053
I know. Iris.

449
00:24:32.012 --> 00:24:34.139
And I know that Deon has
told you to stay put

450
00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:35.808
until he can figure out how to help you.

451
00:24:36.141 --> 00:24:38.560
But you are getting worse by the hour.

452
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:41.480
I really think that we should
get you to S.T.A.R. Labs--

453
00:24:41.689 --> 00:24:44.692
No. Don't. It might happen to you. too.

454
00:24:45.526 --> 00:24:47.778
Oh. so now you're worried
about hurting people.

455
00:24:48.654 --> 00:24:51.365
Tinya. look. I am so sorry
about what happened to your mom.

456
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.995
Okay. I need to get her home.
back to Central City.

457
00:24:56.203 --> 00:24:57.121
Oh. it's too late.

458
00:24:57.955 --> 00:24:58.831
Now walk away.

459
00:24:58.914 --> 00:25:00.791
-Tinya.
-Shut up!

460
00:25:01.917 --> 00:25:03.877
Tinya. you don't want to do this.

461
00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:07.798
Yeah. I do.

462
00:25:15.973 --> 00:25:17.266
What did you do to her?

463
00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:19.852
Exactly what I'll do to you
if you ever try to find me again.

464
00:25:25.858 --> 00:25:28.444
Wait. so Ronnie said he doesn't
want to be brought back.

465
00:25:28.777 --> 00:25:31.071
He just wants to be released

466
00:25:31.155 --> 00:25:33.198
from whatever prison
he's been in all this time.

467
00:25:33.699 --> 00:25:37.327
But if we don't save Ronnie.
the fire will keep killing people.

468
00:25:38.162 --> 00:25:38.996
No. it won't.

469
00:25:40.289 --> 00:25:42.124
We're not gonna let
the fire kill anyone else.

470
00:25:42.458 --> 00:25:43.333
We are going to stop it.

471
00:25:44.668 --> 00:25:45.544
The only way we can.

472
00:25:46.253 --> 00:25:48.464
You're going to use
the Cold Fusion Sphere to trap it.

473
00:25:48.922 --> 00:25:51.633
And end Ronnie's pain once and for all.

474
00:25:59.641 --> 00:26:04.813
I wish things were different. but
we've got to do this for Ronnie's sake.

475
00:26:05.147 --> 00:26:08.275
And we're sure
this is what Ronnie wants?

476
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:13.906
Yeah.

477
00:26:13.989 --> 00:26:15.991
I mean. it would explain
why he's come back.

478
00:26:16.784 --> 00:26:19.244
And why he was so desperate
to connect with Caitlin.

479
00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:23.665
And helping Ronnie move on
would keep the city safe.

480
00:26:24.374 --> 00:26:27.336
What about that Quantum Splicer-thingy?

481
00:26:27.878 --> 00:26:29.338
Can't you at least try that?

482
00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:31.215
The Quantum Splicer works

483
00:26:31.298 --> 00:26:33.258
by bombarding the user's atoms
with energy

484
00:26:33.342 --> 00:26:36.637
to create fission. but it requires
the participant to be willing.

485
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:41.809
If Ronnie rejects the Splicer. his
atomic structures would become unstable.

486
00:26:42.267 --> 00:26:44.520
resulting in endothermic explosion.

487
00:26:44.812 --> 00:26:45.938
He's not gonna try.

488
00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:50.984
All Ronnie wants now is to be at peace.

489
00:26:53.278 --> 00:26:55.989
Okay. If this is what we're doing.
then what's the plan?

490
00:26:56.156 --> 00:26:58.367
We'd use the Cold Fusion Sphere.
just like before.

491
00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.369
only this time.
without putting anyone in danger.

492
00:27:00.702 --> 00:27:02.162
And then. once it's trapped inside--

493
00:27:02.246 --> 00:27:04.957
We just need to remove
the oxidizing agents.

494
00:27:05.749 --> 00:27:08.168
and it's bye-bye flames. for good.

495
00:27:09.044 --> 00:27:10.254
I know how this sounds.

496
00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.508
But it feels like it's what
the Ronnie we knew wants.

497
00:27:15.968 --> 00:27:16.969
We have to honor that.

498
00:27:20.848 --> 00:27:22.683
Okay. um. I'm gonna talk to Caitlin.

499
00:27:22.766 --> 00:27:24.852
-She needs to know what--
-No. I'll do it.

500
00:27:25.352 --> 00:27:26.436
She should hear it from me.

501
00:27:39.324 --> 00:27:41.201
Go. go. go!

502
00:27:41.743 --> 00:27:42.661
Come on! Go. go. go!

503
00:27:46.498 --> 00:27:48.250
No. No. No. Cait. come on.
we almost got it.

504
00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:50.002
Ugh! You said that 20 minutes ago.

505
00:27:50.961 --> 00:27:52.296
It's fine. It doesn't matter.

506
00:27:52.379 --> 00:27:54.006
We missed our check-in
for the bed and breakfast.

507
00:27:54.089 --> 00:27:56.925
We are stranded in the middle of nowhere
with no cell service.

508
00:27:57.009 --> 00:27:59.636
-Okay.
-So much for a romantic weekend away.

509
00:28:00.596 --> 00:28:01.889
I had big plans. you know.

510
00:28:01.972 --> 00:28:04.808
Plans that did not
involve us getting pneumonia.

511
00:28:04.933 --> 00:28:06.226
Well. I had big plans. too. all right.

512
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:07.561
Yeah. well. not like my plans.

513
00:28:07.644 --> 00:28:09.479
Mine were once-in-a-generation.

514
00:28:09.563 --> 00:28:11.690
tell-your-grandkids.
get-down-on-one-knee kinda plans.

515
00:28:11.773 --> 00:28:12.649
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

516
00:28:13.817 --> 00:28:14.943
You were gonna propose?

517
00:28:17.404 --> 00:28:22.326
Yes. Because I love you so much.
Ronnie Raymond. it freaks me out.

518
00:28:23.368 --> 00:28:25.704
But everything is ruined now.

519
00:28:25.787 --> 00:28:28.248
No. no. no. no. It's not ruined. Okay?

520
00:28:29.291 --> 00:28:30.876
I know you wanted to go
to that bed and breakfast

521
00:28:30.959 --> 00:28:34.213
where we first fell in love.
but maybe we need to stop

522
00:28:34.296 --> 00:28:37.591
trying to recreate the past.
and focus on the future.

523
00:28:38.217 --> 00:28:41.511
Okay? Because when I look at you.
I see forever.

524
00:28:42.221 --> 00:28:43.889
And I want forever to start right now.

525
00:28:44.223 --> 00:28:45.182
Me. too.

526
00:28:46.516 --> 00:28:48.769
-In that case...
-Hold on.

527
00:28:49.353 --> 00:28:51.730
-Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.
-Ronnie Raymond...

528
00:28:58.362 --> 00:28:59.780
I told you I had big plans.

529
00:29:00.739 --> 00:29:01.698
Great minds.

530
00:29:02.532 --> 00:29:04.534
-My answer is yes. by the way.
-So is mine.

531
00:29:14.544 --> 00:29:15.545
We need to talk.

532
00:29:17.965 --> 00:29:20.592
Barry wants to use the Fusion Sphere
to help Ronnie die.

533
00:29:20.676 --> 00:29:21.760
and the team's on board.

534
00:29:21.843 --> 00:29:23.762
I'm not surprised.
after everything he said.

535
00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.390
I just never thought
you'd go along with it.

536
00:29:29.184 --> 00:29:30.936
I'm really worried. Caity.

537
00:29:31.061 --> 00:29:32.646
Then why won't you help me?

538
00:29:32.854 --> 00:29:34.690
Not about Ronnie. about you.

539
00:29:35.732 --> 00:29:39.695
Look. when Ronnie died.
you and me weren't even "you and me."

540
00:29:39.778 --> 00:29:41.780
I was still in your subconscious.

541
00:29:42.072 --> 00:29:47.077
But even then. I could feel your pain
the moment you realized he was gone.

542
00:29:47.703 --> 00:29:49.371
And that night. when you went to bed.

543
00:29:49.705 --> 00:29:51.164
and every night after that.

544
00:29:51.915 --> 00:29:53.583
But as bad as that was.

545
00:29:53.667 --> 00:29:58.672
watching you pull away from everyone
who loves you was even worse.

546
00:29:59.381 --> 00:30:00.549
And it's happening again.

547
00:30:01.091 --> 00:30:02.968
I'm sorry you felt all that pain.

548
00:30:05.095 --> 00:30:07.055
But did you feel anything else?

549
00:30:08.515 --> 00:30:10.517
I remember how happy you were
before he died.

550
00:30:13.645 --> 00:30:16.857
-Which is why I got this.
-What about Barry?

551
00:30:17.733 --> 00:30:22.904
Sure. Barry's family. but you're blood.
And I will always have your back.

552
00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:29.369
But you got to promise me something.
all right?

553
00:30:29.453 --> 00:30:35.250
You will never shut yourself off from me
or the rest of the team. All right?

554
00:30:35.334 --> 00:30:36.335
I promise.

555
00:30:36.418 --> 00:30:39.755
And Frost. thank you.

556
00:30:40.422 --> 00:30:42.591
You got it. Now let's go find Ronnie.

557
00:30:43.342 --> 00:30:45.427
Okay. great. How do we do that?

558
00:30:45.969 --> 00:30:48.513
We'll search this whole damn city
to find him.

559
00:30:48.638 --> 00:30:52.142
Day or night. rain or snow or whatever.
We're going to find him.

560
00:30:52.934 --> 00:30:53.769
That's it.

561
00:30:54.603 --> 00:30:56.855
Rain or snow. memories in the snow.

562
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:58.607
That's what he was trying to tell me.

563
00:30:59.107 --> 00:30:59.983
What are you talking about?

564
00:31:01.109 --> 00:31:02.277
I know where to find Ronnie.

565
00:31:08.033 --> 00:31:12.829
Kids swore they heard
a voice calling them.

566
00:31:14.206 --> 00:31:17.376
They looked under their bed
and they saw nothing.

567
00:31:19.086 --> 00:31:20.629
They looked out the window...

568
00:31:21.254 --> 00:31:22.422
and saw nothing.

569
00:31:25.592 --> 00:31:26.676
So they went to sleep.

570
00:31:27.761 --> 00:31:28.887
thinking they were safe.

571
00:31:30.472 --> 00:31:34.935
But the children? They never looked...

572
00:31:36.353 --> 00:31:37.270
Up!

573
00:31:50.158 --> 00:31:51.159
Someone there?

574
00:31:53.578 --> 00:31:54.955
Probably just the wind.

575
00:32:17.644 --> 00:32:20.522
Barometric scans just picked up
an anomaly at Piedmont State Park.

576
00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:22.524
And a half a dozen heat signatures.

577
00:32:22.816 --> 00:32:24.109
We need to move. Chester?

578
00:32:24.234 --> 00:32:25.193
The Sphere is ready.

579
00:32:25.277 --> 00:32:28.238
Once the fire's trapped.
this de-oxygenator node will activate

580
00:32:28.321 --> 00:32:30.073
-and the flames will be snuffed out.
-Okay.

581
00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:31.825
-Where's Frost?
-I don't know.

582
00:32:32.242 --> 00:32:33.201
We gotta go.

583
00:32:33.452 --> 00:32:34.536
Hang on.

584
00:32:41.418 --> 00:32:43.170
Everyone head for the park entrance.

585
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.130
Keep going towards the brightest light
you see.

586
00:32:45.213 --> 00:32:46.840
The rest of my team
will get you to safety.

587
00:32:48.675 --> 00:32:51.011
Allegra. Cecile.
six civilians are heading your way.

588
00:32:51.136 --> 00:32:52.262
We'll keep an eye out.

589
00:32:52.345 --> 00:32:53.638
And I'll keep lighting the way.

590
00:32:53.889 --> 00:32:57.976
Hunger... Feed...

591
00:32:58.894 --> 00:33:00.187
I'm sorry. Ronnie.

592
00:33:01.438 --> 00:33:03.315
No!

593
00:33:10.697 --> 00:33:14.034
The Sphere's heating up. I'm not sure
how much longer I can hold this.

594
00:33:14.493 --> 00:33:15.452
You're almost there.

595
00:33:15.869 --> 00:33:18.121
Okay. Barometric readings
are at 60 percent.

596
00:33:18.622 --> 00:33:19.581
Fifty percent.

597
00:33:19.956 --> 00:33:21.082
Forty percent.

598
00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:23.835
Frack. Looks like there's
more civilians incoming.

599
00:33:23.919 --> 00:33:26.171
and they're moving really. really fast.

600
00:33:45.398 --> 00:33:46.566
What did you do?

601
00:33:46.983 --> 00:33:48.235
Exactly what we had to.

602
00:33:59.913 --> 00:34:02.082
You just destroyed our best shot
at stopping this thing.

603
00:34:02.165 --> 00:34:04.042
It's not a thing. it's my husband.

604
00:34:04.668 --> 00:34:06.002
You're gonna get yourself killed.

605
00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.588
It's her decision. let her.

606
00:34:22.018 --> 00:34:25.480
-Caitlin. whatever happens...
-Ronnie!

607
00:34:29.943 --> 00:34:32.237
We promised each other
we'd spend our futures together.

608
00:34:36.032 --> 00:34:37.284
I'm keeping that promise.

609
00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:16.906
It's you.

610
00:35:17.532 --> 00:35:18.658
It's really you.

611
00:35:20.076 --> 00:35:22.996
Cait. you did it. you saved me.

612
00:35:32.172 --> 00:35:34.049
You're okay. You're okay.

613
00:35:35.634 --> 00:35:36.801
We're both okay now.

614
00:36:03.495 --> 00:36:06.623
Ronnie's still recovering from
the massive energy surge to his system.

615
00:36:06.706 --> 00:36:08.792
-but he's stable.
-Oh. thank God.

616
00:36:09.125 --> 00:36:11.086
There's still an occasional irregularity

617
00:36:11.169 --> 00:36:13.421
in his amygdala function
that I haven't quite figured out.

618
00:36:13.505 --> 00:36:15.882
but it should improve
when he gets his strength back.

619
00:36:15.965 --> 00:36:17.342
He's been through a lot.

620
00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:19.886
l... I guess it would be weird
if he didn't have some kind of reaction.

621
00:36:20.553 --> 00:36:23.515
We're all just glad
that he's back. Caitlin.

622
00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.058
Joe's right.

623
00:36:25.433 --> 00:36:26.893
We're all so happy for you. honey.

624
00:36:27.143 --> 00:36:28.144
Thank you.

625
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.021
I've got more good news. y'all.

626
00:36:30.855 --> 00:36:33.400
So. I've had satellites running
barometric scans all night.

627
00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:38.029
There's been zero sign
of our angry inferno anywhere.

628
00:36:38.321 --> 00:36:40.281
Not one flicker.

629
00:36:41.074 --> 00:36:43.326
Caity was right.
Now that Ronnie's human again.

630
00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:44.911
no more grief-eating monster.

631
00:36:45.328 --> 00:36:48.498
Caitlin. I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

632
00:36:49.082 --> 00:36:50.875
I was wrong the whole time.

633
00:36:51.418 --> 00:36:53.294
It's okay. You were just trying to do
what you thought was right.

634
00:36:53.378 --> 00:36:55.255
We all lose faith sometimes.

635
00:36:56.005 --> 00:37:00.927
But the point is. we've brought
one of our family members back here.

636
00:37:01.636 --> 00:37:04.973
Yeah. that sounds great to me.
And I can't wait to get to know him.

637
00:37:05.432 --> 00:37:08.893
I actually think the two of you
are really going to get along.

638
00:37:09.102 --> 00:37:10.145
And you. too. Chester.

639
00:37:11.062 --> 00:37:12.105
What makes you say that?

640
00:37:12.522 --> 00:37:15.608
I mean. I probably shouldn't be
saying this.

641
00:37:15.692 --> 00:37:18.361
because it was a long time ago.

642
00:37:18.445 --> 00:37:22.323
but he mentioned that maybe once.
he. you know...

643
00:37:23.366 --> 00:37:24.826
No. seriously?

644
00:37:25.368 --> 00:37:27.412
What? What?

645
00:37:27.912 --> 00:37:31.624
- Ronnie played D&D in college.
- Once or twice.

646
00:37:31.708 --> 00:37:35.170
Oh. snap. We're gonna help him
get his game on. girl.

647
00:37:35.253 --> 00:37:37.464
Once... once he is better
and all that. of course.

648
00:37:37.881 --> 00:37:39.883
Whatever happened to chess or checkers?

649
00:37:40.175 --> 00:37:42.177
-Dominoes.
-Now. that's a good game right there.

650
00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.136
Okay. Grandpa.

651
00:37:45.013 --> 00:37:45.889
Uh. Caitlin.

652
00:37:48.808 --> 00:37:50.560
For what it's worth. I'm so sorry.

653
00:37:51.811 --> 00:37:56.483
I don't know. my powers. they've just.
they've never been so off before.

654
00:37:57.233 --> 00:37:59.152
I just wish I knew why
I got it so wrong.

655
00:37:59.486 --> 00:38:00.403
That's okay.

656
00:38:00.528 --> 00:38:02.238
All that matters is that Ronnie's home.

657
00:38:02.322 --> 00:38:03.239
Yeah.

658
00:38:12.749 --> 00:38:14.542
Hi. I'm not here right now.
Leave a message.

659
00:38:16.252 --> 00:38:17.504
Voicemail again.

660
00:38:20.673 --> 00:38:22.300
Barry. It's Sue.

661
00:38:30.016 --> 00:38:33.436
Hi. uh...
they told me you were here.

662
00:38:36.105 --> 00:38:37.065
Where's Iris?

663
00:38:38.441 --> 00:38:39.400
I don't know.

664
00:38:40.944 --> 00:38:42.654
I just know that she's missing.

665
00:38:45.782 --> 00:38:49.494
Her mom just vanished.
And then Iris. too.

666
00:38:50.328 --> 00:38:52.121
Barry. I'm so sorry...

667
00:38:52.789 --> 00:38:54.457
Barry? Barry!

668
00:38:54.582 --> 00:38:55.708
Did you hear what I said?

669
00:38:56.251 --> 00:38:57.544
Iris is gone.

670
00:39:04.467 --> 00:39:06.719
Another spike.
Ronnie. we need to check your...

671
00:39:08.847 --> 00:39:09.681
Ronnie?

672
00:39:56.477 --> 00:39:58.396
Caitlin.

673
00:39:59.772 --> 00:40:01.733
Caitlin.

674
00:40:04.402 --> 00:40:05.403
Ronnie?

675
00:40:12.201 --> 00:40:13.202
Ronnie?

676
00:40:16.372 --> 00:40:17.290
Ronnie?

677
00:40:18.458 --> 00:40:19.834
Did you hear that voice?

678
00:40:20.835 --> 00:40:21.711
I did.

679
00:40:23.713 --> 00:40:25.465
Because that voice was mine.

680
00:40:28.301 --> 00:40:31.429
I called you here to show you
that I feel stronger than ever now.

681
00:40:32.639 --> 00:40:33.681
Thanks to this.

682
00:40:36.684 --> 00:40:38.937
I knew you'd understand
what I wanted. Cait.

683
00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:42.774
and that you'd build
exactly what I needed.

684
00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:46.486
Something's wrong.

685
00:40:47.862 --> 00:40:49.656
We need to get you back to the Med Lab.

686
00:40:50.907 --> 00:40:54.160
No. I'm not going anywhere.

687
00:40:54.744 --> 00:40:55.703
Not yet.

688
00:40:56.871 --> 00:40:57.872
Ronnie. you're scaring me.

689
00:40:59.207 --> 00:41:04.963
That's probably because I am not Ronnie.

690
00:41:06.547 --> 00:41:07.674
Where's my husband?

691
00:41:08.049 --> 00:41:09.008
He's dead.

692
00:41:10.051 --> 00:41:11.177
Your friends were right.

693
00:41:11.636 --> 00:41:15.223
Ronnie Raymond sacrificed himself
to the storm in the Singularity.

694
00:41:15.723 --> 00:41:20.311
Gave his life to its power.
his future to ensure its demise.

695
00:41:20.937 --> 00:41:25.817
But in that uncontrollable.
irreversible chaos.

696
00:41:26.859 --> 00:41:29.237
his death gave me life.

697
00:41:29.988 --> 00:41:32.365
Now I am something greater.

698
00:41:32.907 --> 00:41:35.868
something beyond death.

699
00:41:49.632 --> 00:41:53.011
I am Deathstorm.

700
00:41:53.035 --> 00:42:01.035
