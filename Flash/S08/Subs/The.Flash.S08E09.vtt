﻿1
00:00:05.297 --> 00:00:07.674
I'm almost at the goal line.

2
00:00:11.053 --> 00:00:13.555
Look. I know I've been stable
for a few months. and I'm not due

3
00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.934
for another treatment quite yet.
but I appreciate you checking.

4
00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:19.228
Hey. got to check yourself
before you wreck yourself.

5
00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:24.066
All right. well. you're all good now.

6
00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:26.109
-Really?
-Yeah.

7
00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.071
Well. it's... It's just that...

8
00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:31.698
Um...

9
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:35.285
Lately. I've been forgetting things.

10
00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.539
For instance. there was this dinner
at my dad's and I...

11
00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:40.958
Dad.

12
00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:43.293
Weren't you just upstairs?

13
00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:44.294
Yeah.

14
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:49.091
and then I went to the garage
because you asked me to get the files

15
00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:50.551
from the old Scarpola case.

16
00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:52.219
Remember?

17
00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:54.846
Um...

18
00:00:55.973 --> 00:00:57.432
Yeah. I must have just...

19
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:00.143
Checked out or something
for a couple of minutes.

20
00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.982
And then I have this hazy memory
of... of a train station.

21
00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.067
and for some reason. I feel
like you were there.

22
00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:09.903
You forget we had
an appointment in the books...

23
00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:14.074
You're gonna start moving
in and out of timelines again.

24
00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:17.744
It's news to me 'cause I'd remember
something like that.

25
00:01:17.828 --> 00:01:19.621
Yeah. yeah. no. of course.

26
00:01:21.832 --> 00:01:22.874
Hey. um...

27
00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.253
How does someone catch
a "time sickness" anyway?

28
00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:28.589
No idea. But I intend to find out.

29
00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:32.676
Whoa. hold up now.

30
00:01:36.138 --> 00:01:37.097
What is it?

31
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.808
I'm picking up mutations.

32
00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:43.186
Ones I've never seen before.

33
00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:44.980
Well. that sounds bad.

34
00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:48.567
Actually. it could mean a lot of things.

35
00:01:49.735 --> 00:01:51.695
Might even be a side effect
of my treatments.

36
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:53.822
Tell you what. I'm going to go hit up

37
00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:55.866
my Force sibs to see if they can
help me figure this out.

38
00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:59.077
Well. what do I tell Barry?

39
00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:01.371
Nothing. I don't know what this is yet.

40
00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:03.540
So for now. just chill.

41
00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:05.375
Trust me.

42
00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:10.005
All right? As soon as I find out
what's up. I'll come find you.

43
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.424
Wherever you are.

44
00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:39.409
This case gives dead ends a bad name.

45
00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:41.578
At least no one else has been hurt.

46
00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:42.496
Yet.

47
00:02:43.372 --> 00:02:44.790
Barr. what's wrong?

48
00:02:45.624 --> 00:02:48.877
I just can't shake the feeling
that there's something we missed.

49
00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:51.630
Look. I'm gonna dig into the evidence
you gave me

50
00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:52.714
from last week's crime scene.

51
00:02:52.798 --> 00:02:54.132
All right. Thanks.

52
00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:56.259
Hey. where's Caitlin?

53
00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:57.761
We need all the help we can get.

54
00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.097
Ever since she decided
to go all-in with Marcus.

55
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.016
it's open season
on spontaneous getaways.

56
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.728
So one minute. they're listening to show
tunes. getting all weepy on the couch.

57
00:03:06.812 --> 00:03:08.605
and then the next. they got
last-minute tickets

58
00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.524
to Dear Evan Hansen in Metropolis.

59
00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:12.317
Well. good for her.

60
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.820
But where does that leave us?

61
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.738
One step closer
to the truth. y'all.

62
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.157
Okay. so I stayed up all night

63
00:03:19.658 --> 00:03:22.828
building this cold fusion
alarm module for our satellites...

64
00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:29.251
- Chester?
- Uh...

65
00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:30.919
You all right?

66
00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.715
Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. uh...

67
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.092
This all-nighter's got me zoning out.

68
00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:43.515
Here's the deal. So. we know that
this meta's fire powers are cryokinetic.

69
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.185
meaning that their power output
would read as extreme cold pockets.

70
00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:49.229
So. this alarm I just finished building?

71
00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:52.107
It's going to alert us
as soon as there's any rapid drops

72
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.067
and barometric anomalies
anywhere in the city.

73
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:57.195
Only downside is we won't know
where our baddie actually is

74
00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:58.739
until "flames on."

75
00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:00.615
Or someone else gets burned up.

76
00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:04.703
No. the moment we get a hit. I'll be
fast enough to get there in time.

77
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.748
and we can end this
before anyone else gets hurt.

78
00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:13.545
Sue Dearbon.

79
00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:16.339
Loving the non-catsuit look.
Why the change?

80
00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.217
I got restless. So. here I am.

81
00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:22.053
Iris?

82
00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:24.514
Hi. you good?

83
00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:26.683
Yeah. Yeah. I'm great. Um...

84
00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:29.519
Yeah. So what brings you
back to Central City?

85
00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.438
Oh. well. now that Black Hole is gone

86
00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.398
and my parents
are in white-collar prison.

87
00:04:33.482 --> 00:04:35.734
I am in charge of revitalizing
the family business.

88
00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:37.110
so I'm just here showing face

89
00:04:37.194 --> 00:04:40.572
at all the business holdings
and reassure everyone personally

90
00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:43.366
that things are gonna be different.
And added bonus.

91
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.368
I get to pop in on my favorite tenants.

92
00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:49.164
Well. we are eternally grateful
for your help in expanding our office.

93
00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:51.041
Hey. you guys are the ones
doing all the work.

94
00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:54.795
All right.
I have got to jet to Coast City.

95
00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:57.380
We own a string of luxury hotels
I have to go inspect.

96
00:04:57.798 --> 00:05:00.592
-Sounds fun.
-No. No. it's boring as hell.

97
00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:04.137
Yeah. But if I'm lucky. maybe I'll catch
a glimpse of the C.C.P. while I'm there.

98
00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:09.392
Oh. You guys haven't heard. Apparently.
there's been multiple sightings

99
00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:11.353
of someone walking through walls.

100
00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:14.773
It's popping up on socials as
#CoastCityPhantom.

101
00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:17.192
Yeah. sounds like a new meta.

102
00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:20.195
But I wonder how they got
their powers on the west coast.

103
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.990
Actually. I have run into
quite a few metas around the world.

104
00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:27.202
Turns out there's folks all over
the place with latent meta genes.

105
00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:29.704
All it takes is the right set
of circumstances

106
00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:31.122
for their powers to manifest.

107
00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:32.624
Maybe that's what happened
in Coast City.

108
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:37.963
Yeah. giving them their first meta.
Iris. this could be a great story.

109
00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:41.424
Yeah. You should come with me.
I would love the company.

110
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.011
You don't mind staying in posh
five-star hotel suites. do you?

111
00:05:46.263 --> 00:05:47.264
Um. I'll go.

112
00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:49.099
You will?

113
00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.476
Yeah. Allegra can cover things
while I'm gone.

114
00:05:51.977 --> 00:05:52.853
I can?

115
00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:55.689
Yeah. don't you have a blossoming
media empire to run?

116
00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:58.358
Well. I can run things remotely.

117
00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:01.236
And besides. Allegra's right.
I mean. this is a huge scoop.

118
00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:05.115
And if this story pops. it could lay the
groundwork to a west coast expansion.

119
00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:06.449
I am sold.

120
00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.535
Great! That's that. Road trip.

121
00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:09.578
Oh.

122
00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:10.954
Let's go.

123
00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:12.581
Okay.

124
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.047
Is that a cold spot?

125
00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:23.675
Our fire meta just turned up
at 138 South Devon Road.

126
00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:31.224
What the hell?

127
00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:35.562
Flash. did you find him?

128
00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:37.606
Barry. what's happening?

129
00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:42.694
I'm too late.

130
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.079
Black fire?

131
00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:55.665
Yeah. it was like nothing
I've ever encountered.

132
00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:59.461
And it put itself out.
How's that even possible?

133
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.755
I don't know. But I'm telling you. man.

134
00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:04.841
I mean. it was there one second.
the next. nothing.

135
00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:06.801
So. what else do we know?

136
00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.846
The vic's name. Parker DeStefano.

137
00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:13.433
She teaches classes here at the studio.

138
00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:20.815
Hey. are you seeing this?

139
00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:22.609
Look.

140
00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:26.529
Holy Fahrenheit 451.

141
00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.993
Okay. We need a way to preserve it.

142
00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:35.747
Maybe we could try using
the micro-catalyzed containment unit.

143
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.625
-The what?
-Ray Palmer and I designed it together

144
00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:41.836
in collaboration with the foundation
that he named after my dad.

145
00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:46.257
The M.C.C.U. preserves
the vaporized integrity of gases.

146
00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:48.802
but it's back at my workshop.

147
00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:50.679
What does it look like?

148
00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:53.890
It's like an eight inch vacuum-sealed
borosilicate canister

149
00:07:53.974 --> 00:07:55.433
with an ionic-fused base and cap.

150
00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:58.019
I'll be right back.

151
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:04.484
Yeah. yeah. okay. that's going
to take some time to get used to.

152
00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:06.569
Is this it?

153
00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:10.156
Yeah. yes. yeah.

154
00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:11.825
Okay.

155
00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:23.878
Okay. try to determine
its molecular properties.

156
00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:27.298
-then reprogram our satellite module--
-To detect whatever meta-data I find.

157
00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:29.801
Yeah. Then match it to
a city-wide search.

158
00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:31.803
That way. if we're lucky...

159
00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:33.221
We can catch this murderer

160
00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:34.806
before they kill again.

161
00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:40.895
I triangulated the last few
Coast City Phantom sightings

162
00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.439
posted to social media.

163
00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:45.025
and all of them occurred downtown.

164
00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.944
Wow. You're really pulling out
all the stops.

165
00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:51.031
So. how's tricks?
Everything okay at work?

166
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.785
Yeah. better than ever.
I mean. CCC Media is evolving.

167
00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:59.456
How about you and Barry? You guys
still the couple of the century?

168
00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:02.167
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

169
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.210
Lady. it is the best thing.

170
00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:05.253
Agreed.

171
00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:08.840
Uh. yeah. no. Barry is leveling up

172
00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:10.925
and firing on all cylinders
with Team Flash

173
00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:15.346
and... Hold on.
What's with all the prying?

174
00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:16.765
It's nothing.

175
00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:21.144
I mean. I get it. Life's grand
and you're busy as all get-out.

176
00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:24.981
But with all that going on.
you're still really eager

177
00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:28.777
to help this new meta become
The Streak part two.

178
00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:30.403
And Allegra could have handled
this story

179
00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:32.322
and taken some of this off your plate.

180
00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:34.657
Is there anything you want to share?

181
00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:37.619
Oh!

182
00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:40.830
Oh. look at that. We got a hit.

183
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.166
Let's go.

184
00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:48.963
Okay. Not them.

185
00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:55.637
Could be either one.

186
00:09:58.139 --> 00:09:59.349
-We should probably get closer.
-Uh-uh

187
00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:01.726
Give it a minute.

188
00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:15.406
Yahtzee.

189
00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:22.288
Hi. I am Iris West-Allen
with the Central City Citizen Media.

190
00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:23.206
Never heard of it.

191
00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:27.210
-Fair enough. And this is--
-Her landlord.

192
00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:29.671
Yeah. Still not caring.

193
00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:31.923
So. if you don't mind...

194
00:10:32.006 --> 00:10:34.175
Okay. Well. we were hoping
that you could help us

195
00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:35.718
with a story that we're researching.

196
00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.053
Not interested.

197
00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:39.055
It's about the Coast City Phantom.

198
00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.265
You ever heard of him?

199
00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:41.432
Or her?

200
00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:46.146
Look. we don't want
to cause you any trouble. okay?

201
00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:48.106
We really just want to talk to you
and see if

202
00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:50.441
there's any way that we can help you.

203
00:10:51.025 --> 00:10:52.026
What's your name?

204
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.653
I'm not telling you that.

205
00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:54.863
Order for Tinya.

206
00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:56.406
Oh. Tinya.

207
00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:03.621
Triple espresso.
That's a lot of caffeine for a teen.

208
00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:09.002
Okay. I'm gonna be honest. When we heard
that there was a possibility of a meta

209
00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:10.837
-in Coast City--
-What's a meta?

210
00:11:11.045 --> 00:11:12.672
People like you. with powers.

211
00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:15.300
And what?
You think I'm your next headline?

212
00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:17.302
No. no. it's not like that.

213
00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:21.639
It's just in Central City.
we have experience working with metas.

214
00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:22.891
To do what?

215
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:24.976
Well. to help others.

216
00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:27.353
Have you heard of The Flash?

217
00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:30.398
Okay. Well. eight years ago.

218
00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:33.109
I was the reporter
that helped break his story.

219
00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:36.487
And if you let me.
I can help do the same for you.

220
00:11:36.988 --> 00:11:38.114
How'd you guys find me anyway?

221
00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:42.660
Well. metas like you are made up
of dark matter.

222
00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:45.747
and this app helps us find just that.

223
00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:47.582
Really?

224
00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:56.758
Well. good luck finding me now.

225
00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:02.764
Yeah. that went well.

226
00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:08.019
I've triple-checked
the Who's Who binder.

227
00:12:08.102 --> 00:12:12.190
Nothing on a Tales from the Crypt meta
who can conjure up black fire.

228
00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:14.567
With no chemical signatures
to program into our satellites.

229
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:15.985
we're still flying pretty blind.

230
00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:22.450
All right. Keep working the science.
I'm gonna pay Kramer a visit.

231
00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:24.118
Now that she's part of the team.
she needs to know

232
00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:25.286
what we're really dealing with.

233
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.706
Plus. maybe she can help us find
a connection between all three victims.

234
00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:30.750
Just call me if you find anything.

235
00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:31.960
Yeah...

236
00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:35.713
No problemo.

237
00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:42.512
Just me and the scary black flame.

238
00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:44.681
Nothing weird about that.

239
00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:56.317
Okay. Relax. Chester P.

240
00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:57.819
Relax.

241
00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:00.530
You got this.

242
00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:27.932
No. no. no. no. no...

243
00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:41.821
No!

244
00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:50.955
Hey. hey. there's fire!

245
00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:53.374
There's fire! Help! Help me!

246
00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:54.876
Fire! Help!

247
00:13:56.377 --> 00:13:58.171
Chuck? Chuck.

248
00:14:00.214 --> 00:14:01.591
It's okay. It's okay.

249
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.428
It's just us.

250
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.974
You were shouting in your sleep.
Is everything okay?

251
00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:11.726
Yeah.

252
00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:14.479
Yeah. yeah. I just...

253
00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:16.606
It's just a bad dream.

254
00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:18.274
Must've been a doozy.

255
00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:20.610
Hey. are you sure that's it?

256
00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:25.281
I can feel how frightened you still are.

257
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:27.867
No. no. no.

258
00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.661
I'm good. I'm good. Really.
I've just been working

259
00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:32.830
way too much lately.

260
00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:37.877
Maybe I just need some coffee
to power up the old mental hard drive.

261
00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.215
I'm sorry.

262
00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:51.474
Okay. I can feel him struggling.

263
00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:54.685
Anybody else notice that he's
been having a hard time lately?

264
00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:56.104
Yeah. I definitely have.

265
00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:58.272
If something's bothering him.
why wouldn't he say so?

266
00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:00.983
I mean. he's the most
touchy-feely person I know.

267
00:15:01.275 --> 00:15:03.027
Must be super personal. then.

268
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:04.987
To keep us out? Team Flash?

269
00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:06.697
Then that's just wrong.

270
00:15:07.865 --> 00:15:08.783
He'll talk to me.

271
00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:19.544
Since your phone's toast. I'm
downloading Chester's dark matter app.

272
00:15:20.002 --> 00:15:23.131
Only seven hours and nine minutes to go.

273
00:15:23.214 --> 00:15:26.217
Okay. I really need to upgrade
my service. I can afford it.

274
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.677
No. Sue. we don't have
that kind of time.

275
00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:30.388
I mean. Tinya can walk through walls.
I mean. she could be anywhere.

276
00:15:31.055 --> 00:15:34.183
Well. until this downloads.
we have the rest of the day

277
00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:35.560
to come up with a better idea.

278
00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:38.020
And this looks like
the perfect place to strategize.

279
00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:41.941
Okay. well. we need to narrow down
all the places that we think

280
00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:43.568
that she might be and search them.

281
00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:47.697
Great. And we can talk about
the real problem while we're doing it.

282
00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:51.534
Come on. Iris.

283
00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:53.494
What are you really doing here?

284
00:15:57.623 --> 00:16:00.042
It's... It's far out. so...

285
00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:02.086
Try me.

286
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.589
Last year. I started feeling...

287
00:16:06.048 --> 00:16:07.133
weird.

288
00:16:07.675 --> 00:16:11.637
And so. the Still Force
took a look at me

289
00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:16.517
and discovered that I had
contracted a time sickness.

290
00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:22.023
Now. what that means
and how I got it is still a mystery.

291
00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:25.318
But I don't know.
Recently. I feel like...

292
00:16:26.944 --> 00:16:28.571
I'm starting to lose time.

293
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.910
Okay. Okay. I see why you're freaking.

294
00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:36.913
Yeah. And then this morning.
I checked in with Deon

295
00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:39.749
and he found something
that he had never seen before.

296
00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:42.877
And even though he told me to relax
while he looks into it.

297
00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:46.756
I mean. I can't help but feeling
that something is really wrong.

298
00:16:47.089 --> 00:16:49.592
And that's why you threw yourself
into this story?

299
00:16:49.967 --> 00:16:51.802
Yeah. I needed a distraction.

300
00:16:52.094 --> 00:16:54.847
Believe me. I understand.
I did the same thing

301
00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:59.018
when I found out that my parents
volunteered to work for Black Hole.

302
00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:03.397
At first. I was so mad.
I just looked the other way.

303
00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:07.735
I mean. seriously. I did everything
to avoid facing

304
00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:09.320
the consequences of their actions.

305
00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:15.326
But I had to stop running away
and face my parents.

306
00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:18.287
And. Iris. you have to do the same thing

307
00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:21.916
about this fear
around this time sickness thing.

308
00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:27.713
Yeah. but I mean. what if Deon
shows up tomorrow with bad news?

309
00:17:28.005 --> 00:17:29.423
Yeah. that could happen.

310
00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:31.634
You could also be fine.

311
00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:35.888
Either way. you have to stop running
from the fear of the unknown.

312
00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:38.349
It's... It's a race you can't win.

313
00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:42.270
-What?
-Tinya.

314
00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:48.317
What if I'm not the only one running?

315
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.530
I think I know where to find her.

316
00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.588
Got enough for a second cup?

317
00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:11.632
Yeah. yeah. Definitely.

318
00:18:15.219 --> 00:18:17.138
I'm not going to lie.
You look more stressed now

319
00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:19.473
than you did during
the "Trials of Gyntarri" campaign.

320
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.686
Yeah. That was a tough one.

321
00:18:25.354 --> 00:18:27.982
Wow. Even D&D talk
isn't going to perk you up.

322
00:18:28.399 --> 00:18:29.400
I'm sorry.

323
00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:31.861
I'm a little out of it.

324
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:36.657
I know this new fire meta case
is pretty intense.

325
00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:41.370
And as our resident science guru.
you're in it pretty deep.

326
00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:46.042
I mean. you have to examine victims
and run tests on bodies.

327
00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.251
That's a lot of pressure.

328
00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:51.756
I guess what I'm saying is.
you're not alone.

329
00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:57.178
I mean.
we're all in this together. right?

330
00:18:58.012 --> 00:19:03.684
So. if you need to talk
about something. anything...

331
00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:17.531
It's happening again.

332
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.949
How'd it get out?

333
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.117
It didn't. trust me.

334
00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:23.287
I know you're not really here.
This is just another dream.

335
00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:27.958
No. it's not.

336
00:19:33.047 --> 00:19:35.675
Doesn't S.T.A.R. Labs have a fire
suppression system or something?

337
00:19:35.758 --> 00:19:37.218
This fire is cold fusion.

338
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.636
It doesn't produce carbon dioxide.

339
00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:41.097
Our sensors wouldn't pick it up
as real fire.

340
00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:45.851
Please. please. Not like this.

341
00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:50.064
It's here.

342
00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:04.495
I can't put out these flames.

343
00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:07.123
All right. just stay behind me.

344
00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:34.150
I don't get it. First. Chuck has a dream
about this weird fire.

345
00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:36.193
And then. the meta
who created it attacks us.

346
00:20:36.652 --> 00:20:38.529
And why would anyone
want to hurt Chuck anyway?

347
00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:39.864
I don't know.

348
00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:41.574
But we're going to
keep you safe. I promise.

349
00:20:43.117 --> 00:20:44.285
Thanks.

350
00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:46.328
Chester. what about
your barometric-detection thingy?

351
00:20:46.412 --> 00:20:47.455
Why didn't it go off?

352
00:20:47.538 --> 00:20:49.039
When I programmed the search parameters.

353
00:20:49.123 --> 00:20:52.084
I used the default setting
that establishes a tracking grid

354
00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:54.170
outside of S. T.A.R Labs.

355
00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:57.089
Right. Maybe you should fix that.

356
00:20:57.631 --> 00:20:58.716
Yeah. I just did.

357
00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:01.761
I also double-checked to make sure
that S.T.A.R Labs was clear. too.

358
00:21:02.052 --> 00:21:05.848
It's like this black fire meta can
appear and disappear at random.

359
00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:07.975
Plus their fire leaves no trace.

360
00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:09.435
Like a ghost.

361
00:21:15.357 --> 00:21:16.275
I gotta get some air.

362
00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:21.405
He's hurting really bad inside.

363
00:21:21.489 --> 00:21:24.700
Can you blame him? First. two bodies
show up at O'Shaughnessy's.

364
00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:27.077
Then the yoga instructor.
DeStefano. this morning.

365
00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:28.913
Yeah. and now the same person
is hunting Chuck.

366
00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:32.583
a guy who would never hurt anyone.
It doesn't make any sense.

367
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.753
If this meta can get
inside S.T.A.R. Labs undetected.

368
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.421
they could be anywhere.

369
00:21:40.341 --> 00:21:42.092
What if they're
controlling the flames remotely?

370
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:45.471
The shape that we saw in the fire
had no face.

371
00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:46.931
No identifying marks.

372
00:21:47.765 --> 00:21:49.934
Maybe it was some kind of projection.

373
00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:52.686
I mean. it could explain
why you haven't been able to catch them.

374
00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:56.941
The killer's never actually been
at any of the crime scenes.

375
00:21:57.274 --> 00:21:59.235
But that doesn't explain
why our black fire meta

376
00:21:59.318 --> 00:22:00.569
is going after Chester.

377
00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:02.571
Put S.T.A.R. Labs on lockdown.

378
00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:05.407
Nobody. except for me gets in or out.
till we figure out what's going on.

379
00:22:05.491 --> 00:22:06.575
Where are you going?

380
00:22:07.117 --> 00:22:08.911
If somebody
is controlling the fire remotely.

381
00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:10.830
I'm going to search this city
until I find them.

382
00:22:10.913 --> 00:22:11.831
Stay on comms.

383
00:22:13.624 --> 00:22:14.500
On it.

384
00:22:14.524 --> 00:22:16.524
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

385
00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:03.716
She's not here.

386
00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:06.760
How did you get--

387
00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:10.389
I don't know how you found me.
but I'm out of here.

388
00:23:13.058 --> 00:23:14.310
How about you stay?

389
00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:18.314
Right. You do know that I can
walk through walls. right?

390
00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:20.274
Well. we have friends at S.T.A.R. Labs.

391
00:23:20.482 --> 00:23:24.820
And when I told them that we had
a ghost meta on our hands.

392
00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:26.947
they gave me this.

393
00:23:28.824 --> 00:23:31.660
It's called a molecular
destabilizing matrix.

394
00:23:32.202 --> 00:23:34.163
Apparently. all I have to do
is turn it on

395
00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:36.874
and it destabilizes any folks like you.

396
00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:38.792
Within a three-block radius.

397
00:23:39.501 --> 00:23:40.836
What do you say we give it a try?

398
00:23:41.378 --> 00:23:43.172
Yeah. I thought you two helped people.

399
00:23:43.547 --> 00:23:44.632
Oh. she does.

400
00:23:44.715 --> 00:23:46.467
Me. it depends on my mood.

401
00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:49.970
So... Why don't you relax?

402
00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:51.388
Let's hear Iris out.

403
00:23:52.514 --> 00:23:54.016
Why do you even care?

404
00:23:54.558 --> 00:23:56.060
We know that you're looking
for your mother.

405
00:23:57.436 --> 00:23:59.688
It was your backpack. at Jitters.

406
00:24:01.065 --> 00:24:04.485
It looked like your whole life
was jammed inside of it.

407
00:24:05.611 --> 00:24:09.949
I started looking through Coast City's
missing persons database.

408
00:24:10.491 --> 00:24:13.953
And that's when I found out
that you had run away from foster care.

409
00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:17.998
And that your birth mother
worked at that Jitters.

410
00:24:18.082 --> 00:24:20.209
And that this apartment

411
00:24:20.918 --> 00:24:22.461
was her last known address.

412
00:24:23.379 --> 00:24:25.130
Yeah. she's a damn good reporter.

413
00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:30.427
Okay. well. then you also know that my
real mom abandoned me when I was born.

414
00:24:31.387 --> 00:24:34.390
And hasn't tried
to contact me since. Not once.

415
00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:39.186
Not to see how I'm doing
or if I even survived.

416
00:24:39.937 --> 00:24:42.398
But I did.

417
00:24:43.774 --> 00:24:45.484
And it's been hell recently.

418
00:24:45.567 --> 00:24:47.653
But now that I suddenly have
these new powers.

419
00:24:48.278 --> 00:24:50.155
I have a chance to be somebody.

420
00:24:51.365 --> 00:24:56.578
So you wanted to show your mom
what you've become.

421
00:24:58.288 --> 00:25:00.582
Yeah. because maybe she'll think
that I'm something special.

422
00:25:03.002 --> 00:25:03.961
And take me back.

423
00:25:06.005 --> 00:25:10.426
Latent meta powers.
manifested by intense emotion. Check.

424
00:25:12.553 --> 00:25:14.638
Let us help you find her.

425
00:25:20.936 --> 00:25:22.229
Eh. it's just a paperweight.

426
00:25:23.105 --> 00:25:25.357
Like I said. Iris is a great reporter.

427
00:25:26.275 --> 00:25:28.193
And if there's anyone
that can help you find your mom.

428
00:25:29.486 --> 00:25:30.320
it's her.

429
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.197
If you'll trust me.

430
00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:43.876
We're gonna find out
what's behind all this.

431
00:25:46.086 --> 00:25:47.713
And you're gonna be fine.

432
00:25:47.838 --> 00:25:50.716
I'm starting to wonder
if that's still possible.

433
00:25:51.091 --> 00:25:52.217
We've got your back.

434
00:25:52.301 --> 00:25:55.095
Trust me. you're more than
just a part of this team.

435
00:25:55.179 --> 00:25:58.390
You are a part of my life.
and I'm not letting you go anytime soon.

436
00:25:58.766 --> 00:25:59.641
Got it?

437
00:26:04.313 --> 00:26:05.397
Allegra. I...

438
00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:10.611
Never mind.

439
00:26:11.153 --> 00:26:12.071
It's just...

440
00:26:13.655 --> 00:26:15.449
You're just a really good friend.

441
00:26:16.867 --> 00:26:19.328
So are you. The best.

442
00:26:20.788 --> 00:26:22.581
Which is why I gotta tell you this.

443
00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:27.127
That person in the fire?

444
00:26:29.671 --> 00:26:30.881
I know who it was.

445
00:26:32.674 --> 00:26:34.510
And it wasn't some new fire meta.

446
00:26:38.347 --> 00:26:39.264
It was a ghost.

447
00:26:41.058 --> 00:26:43.560
You seriously think
you're being haunted?

448
00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:45.145
For real?

449
00:26:48.899 --> 00:26:51.652
By my father.
That's who was in the fire.

450
00:26:52.236 --> 00:26:54.071
And I know that
because that's how he died.

451
00:26:54.154 --> 00:26:55.781
But for some reason he's...

452
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.658
He's come back.

453
00:26:59.576 --> 00:27:02.621
But... I was there.

454
00:27:02.704 --> 00:27:06.667
and whatever it was.
it didn't have a face.

455
00:27:06.834 --> 00:27:08.210
It was just a shape.

456
00:27:08.585 --> 00:27:10.796
No. no. no. It was more than that.

457
00:27:11.588 --> 00:27:14.216
I wasn't with my dad when he died. okay?

458
00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:15.217
But when that fire appeared.

459
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.220
that thing inside of it
made me feel like I was.

460
00:27:20.264 --> 00:27:23.725
Right there on the road.
where it happened 24 years ago.

461
00:27:25.853 --> 00:27:27.771
It's almost like
I could see the wreckage.

462
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:32.192
And feel the heat
from the engine burning.

463
00:27:34.987 --> 00:27:37.948
And then I could
hear my dad shouting for help.

464
00:27:41.118 --> 00:27:42.035
But no one came.

465
00:27:44.872 --> 00:27:46.206
Allegra. no one came.

466
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:47.708
He just... No one came. He just...

467
00:27:47.791 --> 00:27:48.625
He just...

468
00:27:49.084 --> 00:27:50.002
He died alone.

469
00:27:53.255 --> 00:27:54.882
I don't know what you saw.

470
00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.635
But that wasn't your father.

471
00:27:58.719 --> 00:28:01.597
-It couldn't have been.
-Yes. it was! It was!

472
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.141
Chuck. you told me what happened.

473
00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:05.726
Last year. when you met.

474
00:28:06.143 --> 00:28:09.688
How much he loved you. what a great dad
he turned out to be. All this time.

475
00:28:09.771 --> 00:28:10.731
Chester...

476
00:28:11.815 --> 00:28:13.150
A good father

477
00:28:13.734 --> 00:28:16.320
would not do something like this.

478
00:28:16.403 --> 00:28:20.157
It had to be. Look. Allegra.
I can feel it.

479
00:28:20.741 --> 00:28:23.994
Okay? I can feel it. Like I was
right there at the crash site.

480
00:28:24.077 --> 00:28:25.037
I can--

481
00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:31.960
You said. "Quincy P. Runk loved his son
more than anything else."

482
00:28:33.503 --> 00:28:39.468
Which means.
whatever you felt. or thought you saw.

483
00:28:40.469 --> 00:28:41.553
it was a lie.

484
00:28:42.971 --> 00:28:44.097
Allegra...

485
00:28:47.517 --> 00:28:49.394
I hated him my whole life.

486
00:28:51.396 --> 00:28:53.148
What if this is some kind of like--

487
00:28:53.273 --> 00:28:55.192
Some kind of

488
00:28:55.901 --> 00:28:58.654
messed up afterlife payback?

489
00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:03.617
No! I don't believe in ghosts.
And neither do you.

490
00:29:04.326 --> 00:29:07.287
Which is why we have to figure out
what's really going on.

491
00:29:23.303 --> 00:29:24.930
He's back. isn't he?

492
00:29:25.013 --> 00:29:27.557
If so. he's gonna
have to go through me first. Let's go.

493
00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:33.230
- What's going on?
- We're not sure yet.

494
00:29:33.355 --> 00:29:35.732
We've got cold fires on multiple levels.
and it's spreading.

495
00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.567
And they're all headed our way.

496
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:52.082
If it's cold fire.
how come it's getting hotter in here?

497
00:29:52.165 --> 00:29:53.750
His flames form in a sub-zero state.

498
00:29:53.834 --> 00:29:55.752
but they still give off
high levels of kinetic energy.

499
00:29:55.836 --> 00:29:57.671
Which means they can still
burn the hell out of us.

500
00:30:00.716 --> 00:30:01.800
That was a router junction.

501
00:30:02.676 --> 00:30:03.802
They're in the walls. too.

502
00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:07.264
He's after me. This is all my fault.

503
00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:12.394
No. it's not.
Chuck. you need to concentrate.

504
00:30:12.686 --> 00:30:14.438
Okay? We're gonna
need your help to survive this.

505
00:30:14.521 --> 00:30:17.941
No. I can't. The fire's already burning
through our structural supports.

506
00:30:18.025 --> 00:30:18.859
Once they're done--

507
00:30:18.942 --> 00:30:20.777
Every volatile resource in S.T.A.R. Labs

508
00:30:20.861 --> 00:30:22.904
will melt down
and contaminate Central City.

509
00:30:22.988 --> 00:30:24.031
So. what do we do?

510
00:30:24.865 --> 00:30:28.243
Chester... I know this is hard
right now.

511
00:30:28.327 --> 00:30:29.828
but we need your help to stop this.

512
00:30:30.287 --> 00:30:32.581
That means we need you
to initiate a search protocol.

513
00:30:32.706 --> 00:30:35.125
Look for anything that could create
cold-catalyzed reactions.

514
00:30:35.208 --> 00:30:36.501
We'll buy you as much time as we can.

515
00:30:36.585 --> 00:30:38.295
Okay. I'm on it.

516
00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:43.425
Tracking muon-catalyzed
heat signatures. and--

517
00:30:44.426 --> 00:30:46.053
Barry. the flames
are converging on the Speed Lab.

518
00:30:46.136 --> 00:30:48.430
I don't know why.
But maybe there's some sort of

519
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:50.474
epicenter forming there. or something.

520
00:30:52.601 --> 00:30:53.477
Let's do this.

521
00:31:07.741 --> 00:31:09.117
-Frost--
-I'm on it.

522
00:31:19.419 --> 00:31:22.589
- Our heat index is off the charts--
- Chester.

523
00:31:23.256 --> 00:31:25.509
I just felt a massive wave of despair.

524
00:31:25.592 --> 00:31:27.511
I told you. I can't do this.

525
00:31:27.594 --> 00:31:29.429
He thinks he is being haunted.

526
00:31:29.513 --> 00:31:32.474
by his dad. and that's the reason
all of this is happening.

527
00:31:38.063 --> 00:31:40.190
That's not the reason. Chester!

528
00:31:41.942 --> 00:31:45.487
The despair that I'm sensing.
it's not just from you.

529
00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:48.198
It's like I can feel the pain

530
00:31:48.281 --> 00:31:51.952
of thousands of people. maybe more.

531
00:31:54.704 --> 00:31:56.164
-What the hell is this?
-Cecile?

532
00:31:56.248 --> 00:31:58.917
All right. listen to me. You guys
need to evacuate while you still can.

533
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.502
No. we're not leaving you behind.

534
00:32:06.716 --> 00:32:07.801
It's here.

535
00:32:09.511 --> 00:32:11.388
All that pain and sadness.

536
00:32:17.102 --> 00:32:18.311
All that grief.

537
00:32:24.401 --> 00:32:25.277
Dad?

538
00:32:32.325 --> 00:32:33.243
Take my hand.

539
00:32:37.747 --> 00:32:39.249
It's time to come home. Chester.

540
00:32:42.377 --> 00:32:44.463
I'm so sorry I couldn't save you.

541
00:32:46.214 --> 00:32:48.133
Chuck. that's not your dad.

542
00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:49.593
It's true.

543
00:32:50.343 --> 00:32:52.471
Chester. all of the sadness
that I'm feeling is--

544
00:32:54.264 --> 00:32:56.141
It's coming from that thing.

545
00:32:57.976 --> 00:32:59.603
Allegra's right. That's not your father.

546
00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:02.022
Chester. we belong together.

547
00:33:02.564 --> 00:33:04.858
No... no. Chester.

548
00:33:05.692 --> 00:33:08.236
Everything that's inside of you.
is just moving

549
00:33:08.695 --> 00:33:11.781
from you... into it.

550
00:33:13.325 --> 00:33:16.119
It's... becoming a part of it.

551
00:33:17.621 --> 00:33:20.373
Oh. my God. Oh. my God!

552
00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:24.127
It's feeding on your grief.
Chester. you have to let it go.

553
00:33:26.046 --> 00:33:27.130
I love you. son.

554
00:33:27.422 --> 00:33:31.426
It's lying. No. no. that thing is lying!

555
00:33:31.885 --> 00:33:33.053
It's lying to you. honey.

556
00:33:33.136 --> 00:33:36.056
It wants you to stay trapped
inside of your sadness. Because it's--

557
00:33:39.059 --> 00:33:43.104
Hungry! Chester. honey.
you have to let it go.

558
00:33:43.188 --> 00:33:45.690
I can't. I can't.

559
00:33:46.233 --> 00:33:47.859
Chuck. listen to me.

560
00:33:49.069 --> 00:33:51.279
Think about
the last time you saw your dad.

561
00:33:51.655 --> 00:33:54.282
And what you remember most about him.

562
00:33:54.491 --> 00:33:56.117
That's what you have to hold on to.

563
00:33:57.077 --> 00:34:00.622
Okay? Yeah.
‘cause if your real dad was here.

564
00:34:00.705 --> 00:34:04.167
he would be the first to say.
"Remember how much I love you."

565
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:08.088
Hold on to that. Chuck.
That's what matters.

566
00:34:13.635 --> 00:34:14.594
Take my hand.

567
00:34:19.391 --> 00:34:20.350
My dad.

568
00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:27.482
He would never ask me
to turn my back on my life here.

569
00:34:34.447 --> 00:34:36.866
I know he would love the life
that I've built here.

570
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.118
Yes.

571
00:34:40.996 --> 00:34:41.830
No.

572
00:34:42.789 --> 00:34:43.915
He'd freak...

573
00:34:45.709 --> 00:34:47.294
if he saw my workshop.

574
00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:53.383
And he'd love that I'm working
with an actual superhero.

575
00:34:55.218 --> 00:34:57.387
helping him save the world every day.

576
00:35:00.432 --> 00:35:01.600
No. my dad...

577
00:35:03.935 --> 00:35:05.270
he'd be proud of his son.

578
00:35:07.022 --> 00:35:08.773
And the man that I've become.

579
00:35:09.232 --> 00:35:11.860
I said. "Take my hand."

580
00:35:12.902 --> 00:35:13.820
No.

581
00:35:15.739 --> 00:35:16.990
No. I'm gonna stay here.

582
00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:21.244
For my friends. because they--

583
00:35:22.996 --> 00:35:24.205
They're my real family.

584
00:35:25.373 --> 00:35:26.791
And you're not my dad.

585
00:35:28.418 --> 00:35:30.295
So. why don't you just go to hell!

586
00:35:52.776 --> 00:35:54.819
Chester. the cold flames are gone.
What happened?

587
00:35:55.153 --> 00:35:56.363
I sent him packing.

588
00:35:58.657 --> 00:35:59.949
With a little help from my friends.

589
00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:17.217
Chester. seems like
you had a pretty close call. huh?

590
00:36:18.176 --> 00:36:19.177
You. too. Barr.

591
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.596
Yeah. thankfully.
I was able to phase myself

592
00:36:21.888 --> 00:36:24.349
and Frost long enough
for Chester to do the rest.

593
00:36:24.474 --> 00:36:25.684
Ah. it wasn't all me.

594
00:36:26.017 --> 00:36:28.353
If it wasn't for Allegra and Cecile.
I'd be just another

595
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:30.647
burnt corpse right about now.

596
00:36:31.648 --> 00:36:34.818
Hey. what about the other three victims?
Joe. did you find anything?

597
00:36:34.901 --> 00:36:38.154
I did some digging.
Called in a few favors.

598
00:36:38.238 --> 00:36:41.282
Uh. turns out. our first victim.
Stan Mullen.

599
00:36:41.783 --> 00:36:44.035
recently lost
all his belongings to foreclosure.

600
00:36:44.119 --> 00:36:46.246
Then. Donna Winters?

601
00:36:46.705 --> 00:36:48.331
Her sister died last week.

602
00:36:48.415 --> 00:36:51.376
Let me guess. our yoga vic
was suffering some loss. too.

603
00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:54.754
Fiancé and childhood sweetheart
to cancer.

604
00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:56.464
It's a grief pattern.

605
00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:59.134
Which fits
with where I've been at. lately.

606
00:36:59.342 --> 00:37:01.845
So. this new meta. whoever he is.

607
00:37:02.137 --> 00:37:04.472
eats grief and sorrow to survive.

608
00:37:05.682 --> 00:37:07.225
Yeah. that's not terrifying.

609
00:37:07.767 --> 00:37:08.893
It gets scarier.

610
00:37:08.977 --> 00:37:11.020
We thought we were looking for
a meta serial Killer.

611
00:37:11.104 --> 00:37:13.064
Someone that was
controlling the black flames.

612
00:37:13.148 --> 00:37:14.816
like the figure I saw in the fire.

613
00:37:15.859 --> 00:37:17.277
But the fire created that.

614
00:37:18.778 --> 00:37:22.907
And when I spoke to it. it heard me.
like it could understand or something.

615
00:37:23.575 --> 00:37:24.576
Chester is right.

616
00:37:25.827 --> 00:37:29.414
With all of that sorrow that I felt
coming out of that thing.

617
00:37:29.789 --> 00:37:32.000
I also felt other emotions.

618
00:37:32.417 --> 00:37:36.129
Determination. passion. desire.

619
00:37:36.463 --> 00:37:39.591
It's almost like.
whatever that thing is.

620
00:37:40.133 --> 00:37:41.509
it's got a mind of its own.

621
00:37:41.593 --> 00:37:44.429
So. we're not looking
for a separate fire meta.

622
00:37:44.596 --> 00:37:48.308
No. The will to seek out victims
to kill?

623
00:37:49.184 --> 00:37:51.144
The need to satisfy its hunger
at all costs...

624
00:37:51.561 --> 00:37:53.188
The flames have a survival instinct.

625
00:37:53.271 --> 00:37:55.440
Which means. the flames
aren't being used by the killer.

626
00:37:56.357 --> 00:37:57.358
They are the killer.

627
00:37:59.402 --> 00:38:00.612
Because they're alive.

628
00:38:16.711 --> 00:38:18.713
We're not interrupting. are we?

629
00:38:18.797 --> 00:38:20.757
No. no. no. it's good.

630
00:38:21.174 --> 00:38:24.344
Just trying to
wrap my head around all this.

631
00:38:25.053 --> 00:38:27.972
You know. every member of this team
has dealt with grief.

632
00:38:28.097 --> 00:38:30.183
Me. with my own mom. back in Houston.

633
00:38:30.266 --> 00:38:34.270
- Nash. and Esperanza.
- And Barry.

634
00:38:35.188 --> 00:38:37.816
All that he's dealt with.
and with both of his parents.

635
00:38:38.191 --> 00:38:40.485
That's right. But I guess.
dealing with loss is just...

636
00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:43.404
another thing that makes us human.

637
00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:47.826
When we help each other deal with it--

638
00:38:47.909 --> 00:38:49.327
It's what makes us family.

639
00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:52.747
Yeah.

640
00:39:01.464 --> 00:39:05.343
So. I have some filing I need to do...
Back at my office.

641
00:39:05.593 --> 00:39:06.719
- Right now?
- Yep.

642
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:09.681
You guys stay. I'll see you tomorrow.

643
00:39:16.604 --> 00:39:19.065
Hey. I know we have.
like. D&D plans for tonight.

644
00:39:19.148 --> 00:39:21.943
But honestly. I just... I can't.

645
00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:24.612
Yeah. I'll text Marco and the gang.

646
00:39:24.696 --> 00:39:26.865
Maybe we can
pull an all-nighter this Saturday.

647
00:39:26.948 --> 00:39:30.326
- I'd like that. A lot.
- Me. too.

648
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:32.829
And. Chuck...

649
00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:37.125
You know I'll always be there for you.

650
00:39:37.959 --> 00:39:39.627
-right?
-Yeah.

651
00:39:41.296 --> 00:39:42.422
Yeah. I do.

652
00:39:44.173 --> 00:39:45.341
And. for the record.

653
00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:49.012
you're a very big part of my life. too.

654
00:40:02.483 --> 00:40:05.236
- How's Sue?
- A life-saver. as always.

655
00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.739
And. it turns out that
the Dearbon Corporation

656
00:40:07.822 --> 00:40:10.742
owns an entire city block
in downtown Coast City.

657
00:40:10.825 --> 00:40:13.453
-Oh. she "rich" rich.
-Yeah. and you forget about it.

658
00:40:13.536 --> 00:40:16.664
Until she puts all three of us
in a place like this. and you're like.

659
00:40:17.123 --> 00:40:18.750
"Yeah. billionaire."

660
00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:20.209
So. Tinya is there. t00?

661
00:40:20.293 --> 00:40:24.881
Uh. yeah. she's sleeping
in the suite next door.

662
00:40:25.423 --> 00:40:27.342
She has no place else to go. Barry. I...

663
00:40:28.051 --> 00:40:29.218
I really wanna help her.

664
00:40:29.302 --> 00:40:30.845
Yeah. that's what I love about you.

665
00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:32.972
You make a real difference
in people's lives.

666
00:40:33.056 --> 00:40:34.307
with everything you do.

667
00:40:34.682 --> 00:40:35.683
Yeah. you. too.

668
00:40:37.393 --> 00:40:41.481
Speaking of. I was thinking
that with powers like hers.

669
00:40:43.024 --> 00:40:44.400
she could be a hero. too.

670
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:46.110
Like The Streak?

671
00:40:46.194 --> 00:40:48.279
I mean. why not? That worked out.

672
00:40:48.821 --> 00:40:51.866
Yeah... Yeah.

673
00:40:53.159 --> 00:40:55.328
-Babe. what is it?
-No. I'm...

674
00:40:56.371 --> 00:41:00.124
I'm glad you decided
to stay in Coast City a little longer.

675
00:41:00.875 --> 00:41:01.918
The black fires?

676
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:04.087
Yeah. it's just...
It's not safe here right now.

677
00:41:04.963 --> 00:41:08.925
Um. okay. I mean.
is there anything that we can do?

678
00:41:09.008 --> 00:41:12.011
No. it's okay. I mean.
we don't even know how to locate it.

679
00:41:12.095 --> 00:41:13.388
let alone stop it.

680
00:41:14.055 --> 00:41:15.264
If anything happened to you...

681
00:41:15.515 --> 00:41:16.975
Yeah. No. I get it.

682
00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:21.187
-Okay. well. I love you.
-I love you. too.

683
00:41:21.396 --> 00:41:23.439
- Get some rest. okay?
- Yeah. you. too.

684
00:41:36.703 --> 00:41:38.037
You found out what's wrong with me.

685
00:41:39.414 --> 00:41:40.707
And it ain't good news.

686
00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:48.731
