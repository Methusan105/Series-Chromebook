﻿1
00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:04.546
Barry. we're in position
to attack. Where are you?

2
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.216
Sorry. I saw
a few things to take care of on the way.

3
00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:26.235
So. just the banana?

4
00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.076
Grandma got run over...

5
00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:40.707
You okay?

6
00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:41.875
Don't worry about that guy.

7
00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:43.585
I just dropped him off at C.C.P.D.

8
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.796
Saved by Mr. Flashy himself!

9
00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.882
Oh. I gotta give you a nice. big reward.

10
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:49.800
No. that's not necessary.

11
00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.218
I can't accept your money.

12
00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:52.844
But it's butterscotch.

13
00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:53.762
Oh.

14
00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:55.556
Thank you.

15
00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:56.848
That's very sweet of you.

16
00:00:56.932 --> 00:00:58.267
Hey. Flash.
we're getting hit hard.

17
00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.476
We're not gonna make it.

18
00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:02.312
Hold on. Chester.
I'm on my way.

19
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:14.199
Nineteen! Critical hit.

20
00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:17.369
Urvakk the Cleric
attacks with the Sacred Flame.

21
00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:19.329
Way stronger than my glaive.

22
00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:22.916
Urvakk vanquishes the Lich.
saving our merry band of adventurers.

23
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.376
Radiant damage. Am I right?

24
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.088
What the hell is going on?

25
00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:51.278
The Dungeon Kraken is awoken
by Thodris' fear and pounces...

26
00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:53.488
...pinning the warrior to the ground.

27
00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:54.948
There's no escape for him now.

28
00:01:55.032 --> 00:01:56.575
Save him! Somebody save him!

29
00:01:56.658 --> 00:02:00.537
Help me. Karash the Orc.
You're my last hope.

30
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.414
My turn?

31
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.583
Use your vorpal sword.
Use your vorpal sword.

32
00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:05.542
My what?

33
00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:07.169
What do you do. Karash?

34
00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:10.422
I tell the thing
to raise its little claws

35
00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:12.007
and read its Miranda rights.

36
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:14.885
-Come on.
-Guys. this game is not for me.

37
00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.094
-I'm sorry.
-All right. Joe.

38
00:02:16.178 --> 00:02:18.180
-All right. Let's take a break.
-Don't be like that. Joe.

39
00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:20.140
Let's take a break. Refill our goblets.

40
00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:22.559
Man. you were acting. brah.

41
00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:24.603
Sorry.

42
00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:25.979
No. I get it. I get it.

43
00:02:26.063 --> 00:02:29.650
It is a little different
for family game night.

44
00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:33.070
A little? It's got
a 600-page instruction booklet.

45
00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:35.113
Well. I read the whole thing
in. like. two seconds.

46
00:02:35.197 --> 00:02:36.657
"Well. I read that in.
like. two seconds."

47
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.574
I don't sound like that.

48
00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:41.787
Look. I was a little intimidated. too.
but Iris made me give it a try

49
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.624
and we wound up having
a great time that night.

50
00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:48.293
That sounds like my baby girl.

51
00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:52.047
Any sign of her?

52
00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:55.509
Nora says that Iris is still
in the future. which means she's okay.

53
00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:57.928
The path we're on now
should lead us to her.

54
00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.889
Well. the timeline has split
you and Iris up before

55
00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:02.933
and it never holds. So...

56
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:05.936
I need to have faith
in that just like you do.

57
00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:13.276
Hey. uh...

58
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:15.654
I gotta go to C.C.P.D.

59
00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:16.863
Kramer needs you?

60
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.200
No. not Kramer.

61
00:03:24.246 --> 00:03:26.248
You're trying to make me feel like
I ran back in time?

62
00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.670
What can I say. Allen?
This will always be home.

63
00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.508
Don't worry. I covered for you.

64
00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:40.011
While the Flash was out
stopping robberies in Central City.

65
00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.764
Barry Allen has been
in his lab all day with me.

66
00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:44.683
Captain Kramer
will never suspect a thing.

67
00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:48.311
Thanks. Chief. but it's fine.
She already knows I'm the Flash.

68
00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:51.356
What? You told her already?
She just got here.

69
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.692
Actually. she figured it out on her own.

70
00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:54.609
Well. I figured it out first.

71
00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:56.570
You did.

72
00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:58.238
I mean. good for her.

73
00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:00.407
Uh. so you said you had a case for me?

74
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.616
Yes.

75
00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:05.078
A high-profile theft
at Mercury Labs came across my desk.

76
00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:06.455
What is it?

77
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.665
We thought it was a simple
smash-and-grab job by a thief

78
00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:11.001
who wiped the security cameras
clean before they left.

79
00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:14.838
But the inventory report says they
made off with a gamma absorption array.

80
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.256
And Mercury tech unit says

81
00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.885
a device like that in the wrong hands
can cause all kinds of damage.

82
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.095
Yeah. they're right.
I mean. arrays like this

83
00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:25.682
use bursts of gamma radiation
to interact with cellular structures.

84
00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.601
It could be used for almost anything

85
00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:30.395
from growing super crops
to taking out an entire army.

86
00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.483
So the only way to solve
our mystery is to catch our thief.

87
00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:46.870
I will never get used to that.

88
00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:52.000
So. tire prints from the crime scene
have traces of residual calcium plates.

89
00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.502
It's most commonly found in barnacles.

90
00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.295
which grow directly onto
a hard substrate.

91
00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:56.713
like a boat or a dock.

92
00:04:56.797 --> 00:05:01.885
So the perp is probably hiding out
somewhere near the shipyard.

93
00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.554
Okay. I will get
Captain Kramer up to speed.

94
00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:06.431
Great work. as usual.

95
00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:07.349
Thank you.

96
00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:11.645
So you know what happens now?

97
00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:15.398
Oh. I bring in our mystery thief.

98
00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:20.445
That I'm used to.

99
00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:22.989
Chester. bring up the plans
for the shipyard warehouses.

100
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.491
Our perp is hiding somewhere out here.

101
00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:28.578
Might as well list the whole area
on villainhideouts.com.

102
00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:31.957
These warehouses
haven't been in use in seven years.

103
00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:36.086
I think I found something.

104
00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:43.301
Tire treads match those
from the crime report.

105
00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:49.099
Great gamma gadget.

106
00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.977
Barry. that van must have been shielded
‘cause as soon as you opened it up.

107
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.603
radiation readings
spiked through the roof.

108
00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:55.939
It's the gamma array.

109
00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.943
Whoever stole this
made some seriously advanced mods.

110
00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:02.529
I'm gonna run it back
for a full analysis.

111
00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:11.913
Oh. you won't be running anywhere
much longer.

112
00:06:12.998 --> 00:06:13.957
Hey.

113
00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:18.003
You're the bad guy. aren't you?

114
00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:20.297
You wanna save us both some time

115
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.925
and tell me what these mods do
before I take you to prison or after?

116
00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:26.845
Why don't I show you?

117
00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:35.520
Flash. are you okay?

118
00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:38.023
Flash!

119
00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:46.156
Enjoy what time you have left. Flash.

120
00:06:54.331 --> 00:06:56.666
Oh! What hit me?

121
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.335
Gideon. run a full diagnostic.

122
00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:00.629
Commencing
full-body diagnostic scan.

123
00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:06.927
Multiple biological abnormalities
detected.

124
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.011
What?

125
00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:10.513
What kind of abnormalities?

126
00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:14.017
Moderate signs of arthritis.
hearing loss. osteoporosis.

127
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.894
high cholesterol and heartburn.

128
00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:17.020
That's what that is.

129
00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.772
Holy Benjamin Button. Barry!

130
00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:21.858
Every cell in your body
has deteriorated suddenly.

131
00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:24.986
It says here that
you've aged 30 years overnight.

132
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.572
How is that possible?
He looks exactly the same.

133
00:07:27.656 --> 00:07:29.741
It looks like the blast that hit Barry

134
00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:31.451
was mostly absorbed
by his internal biology.

135
00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:35.872
Organs. cardiovascular system.
bones. joints.

136
00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:38.041
He may look young on the outside.

137
00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:40.919
but on the inside.
things are very different.

138
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.754
Can we reverse it?

139
00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:47.217
Maybe. but I'd need the device
that whammied you to even try.

140
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.344
All right. let's find
Dr. Creep-face and get it.

141
00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.806
But why build an "old gun" anyway?

142
00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:54.724
I don't know. but whatever
the reason. it's probably dangerous.

143
00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:56.893
I'm gonna go back
to his warehouse and search for clues.

144
00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:58.979
Hang on. Hang on.
Do you really think it's a good idea

145
00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:00.855
for you to go out in the field
like this?

146
00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:03.108
Do we even know...
has this affected your powers?

147
00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:09.572
Gideon run a meta efficiency test.

148
00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:10.865
Test initiated.

149
00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:12.117
We'll start with phasing.

150
00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:24.838
Oh.

151
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:25.922
Come on.

152
00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:27.257
Phasing unsuccessful.

153
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.466
Phasing's pretty advanced.

154
00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:30.260
- Yeah.
- Um. yeah.

155
00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:32.512
Okay. let's try something easier.

156
00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:34.431
Wind arms.

157
00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:37.434
Wind arms are easier.

158
00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:43.314
Oh. my.

159
00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:45.483
Come on!

160
00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:48.278
- Test complete.
- l almost had it.

161
00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:51.740
Meta ability has decreased by 29%.

162
00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:53.742
Okay. Barry. honey.
why don't you come sit down?

163
00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:54.659
I'm fine.

164
00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:56.327
I'm fine.

165
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.414
I can...
I can feel the Speed Force inside me.

166
00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:04.878
I just need to stretch my legs.
get them moving...

167
00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:10.050
Figure out what I can still handle.

168
00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:20.018
I'm okay.

169
00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:23.605
I already updated the software.

170
00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:25.482
Now I've got to give
the damn thing a name.

171
00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:27.317
How about "vacuum"?

172
00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:30.487
There's the Joe West I know.

173
00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:32.238
It's good to see you. man.

174
00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:33.281
Hey. David.

175
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.158
Hey.

176
00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.536
Barry told me you'd be around.

177
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.663
Sorry. I've just been screaming
at electronic equipment

178
00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:42.123
for the last couple hours.

179
00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:43.792
I wanted to see
how retirement was treating you.

180
00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:47.420
I was expecting all-day football
or a wine and jazz room.

181
00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:49.881
not an appliance minefield.

182
00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:52.842
Yeah. ever since
Jenna's been to pre-school.

183
00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:56.096
I've had more time on my hands.
A lot more.

184
00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:59.057
You know. you could just use
some of this time to find ways to relax.

185
00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:02.143
When Rob's mom retired.
she took up meditation.

186
00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.896
That sounds like a whole lot
of sitting around doing nothing.

187
00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:08.817
Plus all these little projects
keep me busy.

188
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:14.614
The problem is. each one of them comes
with a novel-long instruction booklet.

189
00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:18.576
I mean. you have to learn how to program
a computer to just use a mop.

190
00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:20.829
You know what?

191
00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:23.873
Rob and I got his mother
one of these last Christmas.

192
00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:27.669
Let's see what you're working with.

193
00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:42.016
-Hey!
-Hi.

194
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.476
You look better. How do you feel?

195
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.854
I'm just a little tired.

196
00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:49.440
But as long as I keep it under Mach 10.
I can maintain control of my speed.

197
00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:50.817
And that's more than
fast enough to catch this guy.

198
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.821
Right. but we know that Allegra
can handle herself out in the field.

199
00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:58.283
So when crazy scientist guy comes back.
then she and Chester can handle it.

200
00:10:58.366 --> 00:10:59.200
And I can even help out--

201
00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:02.287
Cecile. I can't risk any of you
getting hit with that machine.

202
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.830
And you heard Chester.
the only way to cure me

203
00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:04.914
is to get the gamma array back.

204
00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.000
and the best way to do that
is with my speed.

205
00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:10.420
But are you sure that
this is the right way to do it?

206
00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:13.798
It just feels like you're racing
past some red flags here.

207
00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:17.260
I mean. is everything okay?

208
00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:21.264
Guys. we've got a break-in
at Magnus Labs.

209
00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:23.808
Another tech facility.
Guess we found our guy.

210
00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:27.478
Chester. get ready to adjust
that gamma array when I get back.

211
00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:28.605
I won't be long.

212
00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:39.199
High velocity object incoming.

213
00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:48.583
I assumed correctly you would
recognize a thermal detonator. Flash.

214
00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:50.543
Barry. that's no ordinary grenade.

215
00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:52.795
It's got major bad energy
emanating from it.

216
00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:55.048
He modified it to pack a serious punch.

217
00:11:56.674 --> 00:11:58.384
This isn't the answer
to getting what you want.

218
00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.679
There is only one way
to get what I want.

219
00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:03.640
and it's in here.

220
00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:06.267
I am going to obtain a power
more precious

221
00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:09.979
than any ever wielded by a "superhero."

222
00:12:12.023 --> 00:12:13.316
How's this for power?

223
00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:20.198
Cute.

224
00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:21.866
My turn.

225
00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:45.014
His heart rate's spiking.

226
00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:45.974
Barry?

227
00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:47.392
Barry!

228
00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:58.069
Well. there's no permanent
damage. but you're nearsighted now.

229
00:12:58.152 --> 00:13:00.863
Why did your vision go bad?

230
00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:02.615
You didn't have this problem earlier.

231
00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:05.743
That's not the only new thing.

232
00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:08.288
It's just. like...

233
00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:12.667
I thought he was only supposed
to be old on the inside.

234
00:13:15.586 --> 00:13:20.425
Hey. Chester. run my scan results
through Gideon's bio-algorithm

235
00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:22.218
and let's take a detailed look.

236
00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:25.221
Done. And if I'm reading this right...

237
00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.015
Um...

238
00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:29.225
You aged another ten years.

239
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:31.644
What?

240
00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:34.147
How? Was it the grenade blast?

241
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.606
I don't think so.

242
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.985
It looks like the gamma radiation
inside Barry's cells

243
00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:41.988
is activated by his Speed Force energy.

244
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:45.908
Chuck. are you seriously saying
that the more the Flash runs...

245
00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:47.994
The more he ages.

246
00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:50.455
Barry. you gotta stop using your speed.

247
00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:52.457
Cecile. I have to find this guy.

248
00:13:55.918 --> 00:13:57.545
Hold on. Maybe Cecile's right.

249
00:13:57.628 --> 00:14:00.089
You almost had a heart attack
back at Magnus Labs.

250
00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:02.091
Plus. if your aging's
showing on the outside.

251
00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:04.761
I can't even imagine
what's going on inside your body.

252
00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:06.929
Guys. I won't let this guy get away.

253
00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:08.306
We still don't even know
what he's planning.

254
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:10.099
What if he uses this device
on someone else?

255
00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:13.019
And what if you die of old age
before you can stop him?

256
00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:14.187
I won't.

257
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.938
Look. we just need to
track this guy down

258
00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:17.523
as soon as possible and end this.

259
00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:19.317
And I think I know how to start.

260
00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:22.904
You found out who he is?

261
00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:25.656
Yeah. he wiped the security cameras
at his first crime scene.

262
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.867
but I showed up
before he had a chance to do it again.

263
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.119
Pulled this photo from the footage
and ran a background check.

264
00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:31.704
Dr. Pytor Orloff.

265
00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:35.833
Former technician at a small R & D lab.
Corbin Taft Industries.

266
00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:39.003
Says here he was fired
for using company resources

267
00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:40.546
on unsanctioned research.

268
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:44.217
I'm gonna check his old lab at Taft.
See if Dr. Olsen left any clues.

269
00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:47.678
Barry. it's Dr. Orloff. remember?

270
00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:48.596
That's what I meant.

271
00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:51.474
And I'm gonna need
those contacts. Chester.

272
00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:52.392
Yeah.

273
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.559
Thanks.

274
00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:54.894
Okay. I'm gonna go with you.

275
00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:56.396
Cecile...

276
00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:58.439
Look. this guy has surprised us
a couple of times already.

277
00:14:58.523 --> 00:15:00.400
and my powers will feel him coming

278
00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:02.902
if he decides to show up
while we're at his lab.

279
00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:04.821
Okay.

280
00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:06.322
Great! Oh! Uh...

281
00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:09.450
Real quick. This time...
We're gonna take my car.

282
00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:18.042
"Now. use the provided
triangular hex bracket tool

283
00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.669
to fasten the side brushes."

284
00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:21.379
Yeah. I couldn't find
whatever the hell that is.

285
00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:23.506
So I'm using my trusty.
dusty socket wrench.

286
00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:24.841
Are you sure
that it's going to fit the--

287
00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.676
Uh...

288
00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:29.512
Just a little elbow grease.

289
00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.140
All right.
let's see if this thing works.

290
00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:42.108
Oh!

291
00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:43.651
Damn it!

292
00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:50.241
Why do we need robots
for a man's job. anyway?

293
00:15:50.324 --> 00:15:52.410
Jenna's going to have
to learn what chores are.

294
00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:56.497
Joe...

295
00:15:58.291 --> 00:15:59.959
I love you. man. but...

296
00:16:01.043 --> 00:16:03.504
I've not seen you
this frustrated since...

297
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.384
Do you remember the Steve Palmer case?

298
00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:12.472
Look. man. I would spend months
and months and months on a case

299
00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:13.514
if that's what it took. right?

300
00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:16.559
I mean. obviously it wasn't easy.
but I loved it.

301
00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:17.810
I loved it.

302
00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:24.108
Now. I'm...

303
00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:30.698
Uh. okay. that's enough of that.

304
00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:32.283
I'm calling in a 10-85.

305
00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:34.744
Delay due to coffee break.

306
00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:36.412
You. my friend. need to
get out of this house badly.

307
00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:38.706
Man. let me just clean up
this vacuum mess.

308
00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:40.374
Oh. no. Joe. I'm not asking.

309
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.294
This is an order
from the Chief of Police.

310
00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:45.671
Let's roll.

311
00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:49.008
All right. You're buying.

312
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.676
Don't I always?

313
00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:52.178
True.

314
00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:57.141
Look for Orloff's
old work files.

315
00:16:57.767 --> 00:17:00.144
Maybe they could tell us where he's
hiding or what he could be planning.

316
00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:04.440
Usually. these facilities
have strict record-keeping.

317
00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:10.738
I got it.

318
00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:16.327
Okay.

319
00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:27.421
What was that?

320
00:17:27.505 --> 00:17:30.967
I think it was a facial ID scan.
Like how your phone unlocks.

321
00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:36.597
That's a countdown
to wipe the hard drive.

322
00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:38.891
If we don't hack past this now.
all the data's going to be erased.

323
00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:40.142
I need to run this to Chester.

324
00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:41.602
Wait. no. Barry. you can't.

325
00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:43.479
I don't have a choice. We need
to find out what's on this hard drive.

326
00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:44.897
Well. then there's gotta be another way.

327
00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:46.148
Let's just take a second and think--

328
00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:48.067
I don't have time.
We need to run this to C.C.P.D.

329
00:17:48.192 --> 00:17:49.026
C.CP.D.?

330
00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:50.403
You mean S.T.A.R.?

331
00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:51.988
Barry. that's the second time
you forgot something.

332
00:17:52.113 --> 00:17:54.282
I didn't forget it. I misspoke. okay?
We need to go right now.

333
00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:04.959
Where did you take us?

334
00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:12.842
Barry...

335
00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:14.927
We are a long way from home.

336
00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:16.846
Barry!

337
00:18:20.808 --> 00:18:22.018
How did we get here?

338
00:18:29.483 --> 00:18:32.612
Connections in the hippocampus
are showing gradual decay.

339
00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:36.032
While cognitive functions
have returned to normal levels.

340
00:18:36.407 --> 00:18:39.410
Barry Allen's memory loss
will likely be a recurring event.

341
00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:45.666
Barry...

342
00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:48.586
How you feeling?

343
00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:52.340
I feel like we don't have time for this.
I'm fine now.

344
00:18:52.423 --> 00:18:54.634
Barr. I don't think you get
how serious this is.

345
00:18:54.717 --> 00:18:57.887
Look. according to your latest
bio-scan results from Gideon.

346
00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:01.682
if you use that much speed
again. it could kill you.

347
00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:06.562
Okay.

348
00:19:08.564 --> 00:19:10.775
Then we need to find Orloff
more than ever.

349
00:19:10.858 --> 00:19:13.569
Getting his gamma array
is still the only way to cure me

350
00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:15.154
and stop whatever he's planning.

351
00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:17.573
Chester. were you able
to save his laptop?

352
00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:20.660
I managed to stop the countdown.

353
00:19:20.868 --> 00:19:24.288
but it's going to take
some more time for me to hack inside.

354
00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:25.706
Okay. Well. let me know when you do.

355
00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:27.792
In the meantime.
everyone watch satellites

356
00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:29.251
for gamma ray spikes in the city.

357
00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:31.796
Right now. that's our only
other means to find Orloff.

358
00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:34.674
I'm gonna visit the Starchives.

359
00:19:34.757 --> 00:19:37.343
See if I can find anything
to safely hold the gamma emitter

360
00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:38.427
when I bring it back.

361
00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:42.765
Sometimes I feel like
time's chasing me.

362
00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:46.602
I spend half my day

363
00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:52.191
trying to keep up
with the changes all around me.

364
00:19:52.274 --> 00:19:54.443
Like I had to set a reminder on my phone

365
00:19:54.985 --> 00:19:58.489
to pick up Jenna
from her playdate an hour from now.

366
00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:00.324
It's like I don't recognize my life.

367
00:20:01.492 --> 00:20:02.410
All right.

368
00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:06.956
Maybe that's what happens when
you have more years behind you

369
00:20:07.123 --> 00:20:08.749
than you have ahead of you.

370
00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:11.544
You spend so much time looking back that

371
00:20:12.336 --> 00:20:13.963
it is really hard to move forward.

372
00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:17.091
Hmm.

373
00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:19.927
Joe...

374
00:20:20.761 --> 00:20:21.595
Um...

375
00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:23.973
Your life isn't the problem.

376
00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:27.059
Retirement isn't the problem.

377
00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:28.978
It's you.

378
00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.440
You don't want to move forward.

379
00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:34.817
You've always been like this.

380
00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:36.861
Stuck in your ways.

381
00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.281
Not really willing
to embrace anything new.

382
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:45.536
My ways put hundreds
of criminals behind bars.

383
00:20:47.538 --> 00:20:48.372
Mm.

384
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:55.546
Do you know why it took us so long
to close the Steve Palmer case?

385
00:20:56.547 --> 00:20:57.882
It wasn't just ‘cause of the dead ends.

386
00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:02.803
It was because you refused to learn
the new C.C.P.D. computer system.

387
00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:08.684
Listen now.
my file folders worked just fine.

388
00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:09.685
Maybe.

389
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.565
And maybe you spent a lot
of extra time filling out forms.

390
00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:19.111
Time you could have spent
doing the job you love instead.

391
00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:22.490
Joe. your life has always been changing.

392
00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:24.533
Think about it.

393
00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:26.952
You were a single father

394
00:21:27.036 --> 00:21:30.289
who took in a traumatized boy
who just lost both of his parents.

395
00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:35.085
And you raised that boy to be
one of the most extraordinary humans

396
00:21:35.169 --> 00:21:36.295
to ever walk the Earth.

397
00:21:43.427 --> 00:21:44.303
Joe.

398
00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:48.098
you raised the Flash.

399
00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:54.021
And he didn't get his greatest
superpowers from a bolt of lightning.

400
00:21:55.272 --> 00:21:59.401
He got them from the man who embraced
an unexpected time in his life.

401
00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:05.866
He got them from you. Joe West.

402
00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:14.208
Now imagine all the amazing new things
Joe West can still do with his life.

403
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.717
Yeah.

404
00:22:23.741 --> 00:22:25.741
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

405
00:22:58.002 --> 00:22:58.919
Hey.

406
00:23:01.505 --> 00:23:04.174
I've been looking for you. I thought
you were going to the Starchives.

407
00:23:06.969 --> 00:23:07.887
Barry?

408
00:23:10.848 --> 00:23:14.727
l... Forgot where it was.

409
00:23:18.022 --> 00:23:22.026
Okay. All right. Come on. talk to me.

410
00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:37.541
Barry. what's going on with you?

411
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:39.543
You're not normally this stubborn.

412
00:23:40.753 --> 00:23:43.797
And what are you trying to prove. honey?
You know you're scaring all of us.

413
00:23:47.593 --> 00:23:49.386
I'm scared. too. Cecile.

414
00:23:52.306 --> 00:23:54.600
Orloff's still out there and I can't...

415
00:24:00.314 --> 00:24:01.941
I feel myself withering.

416
00:24:03.651 --> 00:24:07.613
When I run. my bones ache.
like they're made of glass and...

417
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.117
My hands won't stop shaking.

418
00:24:13.535 --> 00:24:15.955
I'm always out of breath
and it's getting harder.

419
00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:27.549
It's getting harder
to remember the people I love.

420
00:24:30.678 --> 00:24:31.595
My friends.

421
00:24:33.889 --> 00:24:36.350
Nora. Bart. Joe.

422
00:24:39.478 --> 00:24:40.521
Even Iris.

423
00:24:47.736 --> 00:24:52.449
What if I forget who she is
before she comes back?

424
00:24:59.373 --> 00:25:03.752
I thought I had plenty
of time to get Iris back...

425
00:25:05.796 --> 00:25:08.090
And live my life with her.

426
00:25:09.466 --> 00:25:13.512
Now it's all fading away. like my body.

427
00:25:15.514 --> 00:25:17.766
And now. with my mind going. too.

428
00:25:20.811 --> 00:25:25.441
it's like losing everyone you love...

429
00:25:27.901 --> 00:25:28.944
all at once.

430
00:25:39.455 --> 00:25:42.833
You know. you're not the first superhero
that I've seen go through this.

431
00:25:45.127 --> 00:25:50.549
No... I knew one badass fighter
through and through.

432
00:25:52.676 --> 00:25:53.594
My grandmother.

433
00:25:57.056 --> 00:26:02.936
And. just like you. she was always
running from one adventure to the next.

434
00:26:06.398 --> 00:26:08.650
Not just when
she was young and spry. either.

435
00:26:08.734 --> 00:26:13.697
Oh. no. no. I mean. I'm talking
well into her golden years.

436
00:26:16.158 --> 00:26:18.327
She never lost her love for life and...

437
00:26:19.828 --> 00:26:23.874
that inspired me to do more with my own.

438
00:26:27.461 --> 00:26:29.296
She sounds like an amazing woman.

439
00:26:32.382 --> 00:26:33.342
Here's the thing. though.

440
00:26:37.304 --> 00:26:40.182
She never feared getting old.

441
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:42.184
Mm-mm.

442
00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:44.686
She made a choice.

443
00:26:46.271 --> 00:26:49.983
She knew if she was gonna
run out of time. then. damn it.

444
00:26:50.067 --> 00:26:51.610
she was gonna use the time that she had

445
00:26:51.693 --> 00:26:54.655
to live exactly the life
that she wanted.

446
00:26:57.908 --> 00:27:04.748
See. she knew... She knew
that no one could outrun time...

447
00:27:07.835 --> 00:27:09.378
But you can embrace it.

448
00:27:13.423 --> 00:27:15.592
Barry. nobody's saying that
you can't go get the bad guy.

449
00:27:15.717 --> 00:27:18.679
but don't let your fear
of running out of time

450
00:27:18.762 --> 00:27:22.266
cloud your ability
to see the right way to do it.

451
00:27:27.729 --> 00:27:31.108
Guys. I finally broke
the encryption code on Orloff's laptop.

452
00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:38.448
So I took a look through
Orloff's notes on the gamma array.

453
00:27:38.532 --> 00:27:40.617
He is a next-level genius. no doubt.

454
00:27:40.701 --> 00:27:44.288
but unfortunately he's planning
something seriously dangerous.

455
00:27:47.249 --> 00:27:48.917
This is what he stole
from his second lab raid.

456
00:27:49.585 --> 00:27:54.047
It's an energy amplifier that could
boost his machine's output 100-fold.

457
00:27:54.173 --> 00:27:56.466
So he wants to make everyone old? Why?

458
00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.093
His research is obsessed

459
00:27:58.177 --> 00:28:02.472
with finding the scientific equivalent
of the Fountain of Youth.

460
00:28:03.473 --> 00:28:06.643
He just wants to be young again
and I think he's figured out how.

461
00:28:07.728 --> 00:28:09.146
By taking it from other people.

462
00:28:10.731 --> 00:28:14.109
Can you pull up the security footage
I used to run his background?

463
00:28:16.278 --> 00:28:17.696
Look at his hair.

464
00:28:17.779 --> 00:28:19.156
It's not gray anymore.

465
00:28:20.282 --> 00:28:21.241
His machine works.

466
00:28:22.576 --> 00:28:24.953
Only it needs to absorb a lot of energy

467
00:28:25.037 --> 00:28:27.080
just to make him
even a few years younger.

468
00:28:27.164 --> 00:28:28.540
which is why he stole the amplifier.

469
00:28:29.625 --> 00:28:30.500
Chester. what happens

470
00:28:30.584 --> 00:28:33.128
when he finishes connecting
the amplifier to the gamma array?

471
00:28:35.505 --> 00:28:36.673
He becomes immortal.

472
00:28:37.883 --> 00:28:43.263
And the city. everyone in it. all age
hundreds of years in an instant.

473
00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:45.849
We'll all be dust.

474
00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:21.718
We've got a massive radiation spike.

475
00:29:21.802 --> 00:29:25.097
I'm reading 2.000 millisieverts.
Wait. no. 3.000.

476
00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.974
Orloff just activated his machine.

477
00:29:27.057 --> 00:29:29.977
Okay. we know where he is.
Let's take him down. Pull the plug.

478
00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.521
No. it's not gonna be that easy.
I mean. look at these readings.

479
00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:33.855
If we shut it down too suddenly.

480
00:29:33.939 --> 00:29:37.192
there'd be a cascading
degradation cycle in the gamma isotopes.

481
00:29:37.276 --> 00:29:38.735
Meaning we can't just turn it off.

482
00:29:38.819 --> 00:29:40.529
It's already built up
too much of a charge.

483
00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:43.323
Shutting it off now would cause
the gamma rays to explode out.

484
00:29:43.407 --> 00:29:44.324
affecting hundreds of people.

485
00:29:44.408 --> 00:29:45.575
We better think of something quick.

486
00:29:45.659 --> 00:29:48.203
In a few minutes. it'll be
charged enough to affect the whole city.

487
00:29:48.287 --> 00:29:49.496
Is there any way we can slow it down?

488
00:29:50.664 --> 00:29:51.498
No.

489
00:29:53.208 --> 00:29:54.251
We have to speed it up.

490
00:29:54.835 --> 00:29:57.921
Guys. the gamma radiation
siphons energy from human cells

491
00:29:58.005 --> 00:29:59.589
speeding up the biological aging process

492
00:29:59.673 --> 00:30:01.300
like what's been happening to me
all day.

493
00:30:01.383 --> 00:30:03.510
But if we fed it more energy
than it can handle...

494
00:30:03.593 --> 00:30:05.679
The amplifier would have
to kick into overdrive

495
00:30:05.762 --> 00:30:07.681
to match the high energy
consumption rate.

496
00:30:07.764 --> 00:30:08.932
It would burn out the machine.

497
00:30:09.016 --> 00:30:11.059
Okay. what do we got
that can put out that much energy?

498
00:30:11.518 --> 00:30:12.352
Me.

499
00:30:14.104 --> 00:30:14.938
No.

500
00:30:15.564 --> 00:30:17.274
Barry. you remember what Chester said?

501
00:30:17.357 --> 00:30:20.152
If you use your speed again.
it could kill you this time.

502
00:30:20.235 --> 00:30:21.069
I have to try.

503
00:30:22.112 --> 00:30:25.282
If I die or it ages me to 100.
I'm not afraid anymore.

504
00:30:26.199 --> 00:30:28.493
You are right. Cecile.
I can't outrun time.

505
00:30:28.577 --> 00:30:29.995
but I can embrace it.

506
00:30:30.329 --> 00:30:32.331
And I can choose to spend
every moment I have left

507
00:30:32.414 --> 00:30:33.749
trying to save innocent lives.

508
00:30:36.877 --> 00:30:37.919
Then run. Barry.

509
00:30:39.254 --> 00:30:40.172
Run.

510
00:30:54.728 --> 00:30:55.562
You don't...

511
00:30:57.189 --> 00:30:58.023
You can't...

512
00:30:58.106 --> 00:30:59.358
Yes. I can.

513
00:30:59.608 --> 00:31:00.567
And I am.

514
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.947
Orloff's machine just hit
100.000 millisieverts of radiation.

515
00:31:06.031 --> 00:31:07.199
That's fully charged. Barry.

516
00:31:07.282 --> 00:31:08.909
Whatever you're gonna do.
you gotta do it now.

517
00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:11.536
You're out of time. Flash.

518
00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.163
And slower than ever.

519
00:31:14.206 --> 00:31:18.668
It looks like everyone in Central City
is running out of time. except me.

520
00:31:37.437 --> 00:31:39.064
I don't understand. What's Barry doing?

521
00:31:39.147 --> 00:31:41.108
He just matched
the gamma machine's energy output.

522
00:31:41.191 --> 00:31:42.442
stopping it from expanding.

523
00:31:42.526 --> 00:31:44.236
but if he's gonna overcharge it.

524
00:31:44.403 --> 00:31:46.029
he's going to have to hit
some savage velocity.

525
00:31:58.917 --> 00:31:59.960
Oh. no. no. no!

526
00:32:01.128 --> 00:32:01.962
He's having a heart attack.

527
00:32:02.337 --> 00:32:03.672
How much longer can he hold out?

528
00:32:03.755 --> 00:32:06.341
Biologically. he's over 100 years old.

529
00:32:23.775 --> 00:32:24.651
No...

530
00:32:27.988 --> 00:32:28.864
No!

531
00:32:35.537 --> 00:32:36.371
He did it!

532
00:32:41.835 --> 00:32:43.211
Wait. what's wrong?

533
00:32:43.295 --> 00:32:44.171
Wait.

534
00:32:45.839 --> 00:32:47.257
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

535
00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:53.972
Barry? Barry. what happened?
My readings are saying that you're...

536
00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:56.308
Better than ever.

537
00:33:00.854 --> 00:33:01.771
My years...

538
00:33:02.939 --> 00:33:03.773
My time...

539
00:33:05.108 --> 00:33:06.526
It's all gone!

540
00:33:08.778 --> 00:33:10.238
What do I do now?

541
00:33:12.199 --> 00:33:13.200
My advice...

542
00:33:14.743 --> 00:33:16.495
Embrace the time you have left
in prison.

543
00:33:26.796 --> 00:33:28.882
He looks... good!

544
00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:30.967
Is he good?

545
00:33:31.051 --> 00:33:32.844
Yeah. Now that boy's doing
better than good.

546
00:33:33.386 --> 00:33:35.347
Barry forcing
the gamma array's field backwards

547
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:37.891
completely inverted its energy charge.

548
00:33:38.058 --> 00:33:40.852
So young man Orloff became old.

549
00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:43.522
But not only did old man Barry
become young again.

550
00:33:43.605 --> 00:33:46.983
you completely regenerated
and then some.

551
00:33:48.026 --> 00:33:49.778
Hold on. are you saying I'm--

552
00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:52.906
Sorry to break it to you. kid.
you're not in your 30s anymore.

553
00:33:54.366 --> 00:33:55.367
How old am 1?

554
00:33:57.118 --> 00:34:00.121
Twenty-nine. But y'all know
what that means though. right?

555
00:34:01.331 --> 00:34:03.542
Thirtieth birthday party next year.

556
00:34:03.625 --> 00:34:05.835
Thirtieth birthday party next year.

557
00:34:05.961 --> 00:34:08.088
Party next year.

558
00:34:08.171 --> 00:34:10.715
I gotta tell you.
a party is the least we can do

559
00:34:10.799 --> 00:34:12.300
for the man who saved us all today.

560
00:34:12.384 --> 00:34:15.011
I just... I stopped being stubborn.

561
00:34:16.012 --> 00:34:17.806
And found the best way
to use the time I had left.

562
00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:18.890
Well. you'll be happy to know

563
00:34:18.974 --> 00:34:21.434
Dr. Orloff is going to spend
the rest of his time in Iron Heights.

564
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:23.728
That's thanks to you guys.

565
00:34:23.812 --> 00:34:26.231
You watched out for me even when
I wasn't watching out for myself.

566
00:34:27.315 --> 00:34:28.525
Don't sweat it. boss.

567
00:34:28.608 --> 00:34:30.944
Why don't you keep getting some rest
and we'll see you later?

568
00:34:31.027 --> 00:34:31.861
Yeah.

569
00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.154
Hey. Cecile.

570
00:34:35.407 --> 00:34:37.576
I owe the most to you today.

571
00:34:39.494 --> 00:34:41.496
I'm sorry I didn't listen sooner.

572
00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:44.541
I know your grandma
would be proud of you.

573
00:34:49.254 --> 00:34:50.297
I hope so.

574
00:34:51.965 --> 00:34:53.758
I would consider myself lucky

575
00:34:53.842 --> 00:34:57.929
if one day I could be half
of the role model that she was.

576
00:34:59.139 --> 00:35:00.056
You already are.

577
00:35:13.778 --> 00:35:15.905
So you're a meta. t00?

578
00:35:16.656 --> 00:35:21.494
Yeah. I used to be
like a human light bulb. but now...

579
00:35:21.578 --> 00:35:23.038
She's a hell of a lot more.

580
00:35:25.165 --> 00:35:26.124
So what's your code name?

581
00:35:27.042 --> 00:35:27.876
Uh...

582
00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:32.589
You know. Barry used to be the Streak
and then he became the Flash.

583
00:35:33.173 --> 00:35:34.007
What do people call you?

584
00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:39.220
I don't know. I've never really
thought about it before.

585
00:35:40.013 --> 00:35:42.474
But I like to keep a low profile. So...

586
00:35:47.395 --> 00:35:50.732
Okay. Joe. I'm thinking
we tweak the quest.

587
00:35:50.815 --> 00:35:53.443
We can setitin C.C.P.D.

588
00:35:53.526 --> 00:35:55.070
Maybe we solve a homicide.

589
00:35:56.112 --> 00:35:58.281
We could do that or...

590
00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:04.204
Yes!

591
00:36:04.287 --> 00:36:07.624
What if Karash the Orc

592
00:36:07.707 --> 00:36:11.628
used Vorion root-induced Barbarian rage

593
00:36:11.711 --> 00:36:14.089
and his vorpal sword

594
00:36:15.382 --> 00:36:19.594
to kick some Dungeon Kraken ass?

595
00:36:19.719 --> 00:36:20.720
Yes!

596
00:36:20.804 --> 00:36:23.807
I've been doing a little light reading
in that handbook there. children.

597
00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:26.059
And once I show you all
how to play this game.

598
00:36:26.935 --> 00:36:29.521
I'mma teach you all spades and
you're all gonna need a manual for that.

599
00:36:30.897 --> 00:36:32.023
That's my man!

600
00:36:32.107 --> 00:36:34.984
I'm sorry. I gotta take this.
Hold on. you guys keep...

601
00:36:35.068 --> 00:36:36.194
Okay.

602
00:36:36.277 --> 00:36:37.278
You shall not pass!

603
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:41.783
Carla. hey. what's up?

604
00:36:45.328 --> 00:36:47.038
No. I thought Caitlin was with you.

605
00:37:01.636 --> 00:37:02.554
Caitlin?

606
00:37:17.736 --> 00:37:18.570
Barry?

607
00:37:21.156 --> 00:37:22.699
Caitlin. are you okay?

608
00:37:22.782 --> 00:37:24.075
What are you doing here?

609
00:37:24.159 --> 00:37:26.703
Your mom called. trying to find you.
You said you were staying with her.

610
00:37:26.786 --> 00:37:28.955
but she says
she hasn't seen you since the funeral.

611
00:37:29.038 --> 00:37:30.081
that you haven't returned her calls.

612
00:37:31.416 --> 00:37:32.876
I changed my mind.

613
00:37:34.711 --> 00:37:38.298
Okay. What is going on?

614
00:37:40.717 --> 00:37:43.219
I've been working on some stuff.

615
00:37:44.804 --> 00:37:45.722
What is it?

616
00:37:47.891 --> 00:37:50.268
You know you can ask
for my help with anything.

617
00:37:52.103 --> 00:37:53.813
I know I can. but...

618
00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:56.858
But what?

619
00:37:59.235 --> 00:38:00.153
Caitlin. talk to me.

620
00:38:06.326 --> 00:38:07.577
-Okay--
-What's this doing here?

621
00:38:07.702 --> 00:38:08.912
I know how this looks.

622
00:38:08.995 --> 00:38:10.205
Caitlin. what's this doing here?

623
00:38:10.288 --> 00:38:11.247
Barry. just listen to me.

624
00:38:12.707 --> 00:38:16.503
The Mirror Gun split Frost and me
into two people once before.

625
00:38:16.586 --> 00:38:19.798
It took her from my subconscious
and gave her a body.

626
00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:24.260
So I've been running tests
over and over again.

627
00:38:24.469 --> 00:38:27.055
And there must still be
a piece of Frost inside of me.

628
00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:31.559
so if I can access those latent pieces
in my subconsciousness.

629
00:38:33.186 --> 00:38:34.813
then I can bring her back.

630
00:38:41.027 --> 00:38:44.072
Okay.
I know what you're thinking.

631
00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:47.325
and frankly. if I was in your shoes.
I'd probably be thinking the same thing.

632
00:38:47.408 --> 00:38:48.952
But just for one second.

633
00:38:49.786 --> 00:38:52.497
imagine this isn't Frost
that we're talking about.

634
00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:55.416
What if we could bring your mom back?

635
00:38:57.168 --> 00:38:58.002
Or your dad?

636
00:38:59.587 --> 00:39:03.633
What would you do to make
that possibility a reality?

637
00:39:09.305 --> 00:39:11.516
We don't have to say goodbye to Frost.

638
00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:17.313
Caitlin. losing someone you love
can make it really hard to move on.

639
00:39:18.982 --> 00:39:22.277
But as difficult as it is.
you have to accept that Frost is gone.

640
00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:24.863
And that she's not coming back.

641
00:39:28.408 --> 00:39:29.701
But I don't want to.

642
00:39:32.036 --> 00:39:32.954
I know.

643
00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:37.000
But it's the only way
to start living again.

644
00:39:41.421 --> 00:39:42.630
I can do this.

645
00:39:43.965 --> 00:39:45.174
I have to.

646
00:39:55.643 --> 00:39:56.561
I'm sorry.

647
00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:01.941
Barry... Barry. please.

648
00:40:04.277 --> 00:40:05.153
Barry. don't!

649
00:40:44.609 --> 00:40:45.610
I'm sorry.

650
00:40:45.634 --> 00:40:53.634
