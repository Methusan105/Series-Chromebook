﻿1
00:00:05.047 --> 00:00:09.635
-Eddie?
-Iris. I've missed you so much.

2
00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:11.512
This is not possible.

3
00:00:12.596 --> 00:00:13.889
You were...

4
00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.601
Are you okay. babe?
You look a little flushed.

5
00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:20.604
Yep. that's a fever.

6
00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.439
Can I get you something? Some water?

7
00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:23.565
No. I'm fine.

8
00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:24.816
No. I know what you need.

9
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.778
Your favorite. chamomile tea.

10
00:00:28.487 --> 00:00:31.782
Oh. and don't worry.
I know I've been gone a long time.

11
00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:36.245
But I'm not leaving
until you're all better.

12
00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:38.372
Okay?

13
00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:44.169
Iris? Why is there an attractive
blond man in your kitchen?

14
00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:46.171
Oh. hey. I'm Eddie.

15
00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:47.548
Eddie Thawne.

16
00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:49.967
Iris's fiancé.

17
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.665
C.C.P.D. has ordered a city-wide curfew

18
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.668
after the shocking massacre
that happened earlier tonight.

19
00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:27.921
The mysterious assailant
remains currently...

20
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:29.464
No sign of Deathstorm anywhere.

21
00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:31.842
-How's it going here?
-Good.

22
00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.678
The Mental Augmentation Chamber's
just like I remember.

23
00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.472
Not that I could forget six weeks
of living inside this thing.

24
00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:41.184
So. we're seriously going to turn
Frost into an anti-Deathstorm?

25
00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:45.022
We know Deathstorm is made up
of pure thermodynamic energy.

26
00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:49.443
So we use the MAC to harness particles
from its home dimension

27
00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:52.904
and then beam them
into your consciousness.

28
00:01:52.988 --> 00:01:57.075
The reaction should transform Frost's
body into a being like Deathstorm.

29
00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:00.037
You'll be able to create fire.
defy gravity...

30
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.913
And consume Deathstorm's fuel source.

31
00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:05.709
Once you absorb all that grief energy
out of Deathstorm...

32
00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.628
I'll be able to snuff him out. for good.

33
00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:09.588
Well. it's official.

34
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.132
This is the craziest plan
we've ever had.

35
00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:13.425
Then. let's get crazy.

36
00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.970
‘cause I'm not letting that Skeletor
put another bony finger on my sister.

37
00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:18.972
I just got to finish
the MAC's cryo-circuits

38
00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:20.599
and it should be good to go.

39
00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.893
Guys. I need you
in the med lab. It's Caitlin.

40
00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:26.688
Is she okay?

41
00:02:26.772 --> 00:02:27.606
I don't know.

42
00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.191
Her biometrics are stable.

43
00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:33.070
but I just felt another
huge wave of grief from her.

44
00:02:33.612 --> 00:02:35.072
I just keep picturing Dad die.

45
00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:38.241
It's all I can see over and over again.

46
00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:41.411
-Him on the floor.
-What is wrong with her?

47
00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.872
Remember when Deathstorm took Caitlin?

48
00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:46.708
It was trying to change her
into something else. its bride.

49
00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:48.710
But it still needs her
to experience more grief

50
00:02:48.794 --> 00:02:50.337
before the transformation is complete.

51
00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.422
Must've dialed up
one of her worst memories.

52
00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:54.132
You're going to be okay.
We've got a plan.

53
00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:55.550
What if it doesn't work?

54
00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.636
What if I'm stuck like this forever?

55
00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:58.804
Don't even think like that.

56
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.682
Just get some rest
and I'll be here when you wake up.

57
00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:07.145
How much longer till Chester
has the cryo-circuit ready?

58
00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:08.939
I'm not sure. Maybe an hour.

59
00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:10.899
We don't have that kind of time.

60
00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:12.442
I'm gonna call backup.

61
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.157
-We still need to find Deathstorm.
-I know.

62
00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:21.034
Can you feel anything?

63
00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:24.037
No. It's like he's disappeared.

64
00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:30.293
Capacitor's connected
To the inductor

65
00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:33.088
Inductor's connected to the cryo-circuit

66
00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:35.549
The cryo-circuit's connected to the...

67
00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:39.928
Frak me.

68
00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:59.656
I still haven't
identified the cause

69
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.867
of Iris West-Allen's temporal ailment.

70
00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:03.702
Okay. Keep trying. Gideon.

71
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.122
In the meantime. could you run a search

72
00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:11.168
for any extra-dimensional energies
or cold fusion anomalies in the area?

73
00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:13.295
Of course. Barry Allen. Search--

74
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.424
Gideon?

75
00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:30.020
He's here.

76
00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.521
Actually. I'm everywhere.

77
00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:34.983
And nowhere.

78
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.446
I was born a long time ago.

79
00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.657
Before Maltus. before the stars.

80
00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:46.578
During that lonely blackest of nights.

81
00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:53.335
I was there when the first gas cloud
sank and collapsed.

82
00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:59.716
I was there when the first beings
drew their final hissing breaths.

83
00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:04.387
I am decline. I am entropy.

84
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.725
I am the master of death
and all of its inhabitants.

85
00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:19.069
My beautiful boy.

86
00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:31.081
Guys. it's my dad. He's back.

87
00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:33.416
Esperanza's here.
I need backup--

88
00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:36.837
That's better.

89
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.215
Where I'm from.
there's not so much noise.

90
00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:43.009
If you take one step toward Caity.

91
00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:45.053
I will send you back
to the hell you came from.

92
00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:47.722
My home is much further than hell.

93
00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:50.267
It's a lonely place.

94
00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:54.437
At least it was.
until Ronnie died in a Singularity.

95
00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:56.189
His mind found me.

96
00:05:57.232 --> 00:06:01.653
His grief became my hunger
and his love became my guiding light.

97
00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:05.699
So you're trying to take my sister
‘cause you're lonely?

98
00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.993
Ronnie's feelings
showed me how to end my suffering.

99
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:09.995
I'll show you suffering.

100
00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:16.793
You can't hurt me.

101
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:18.962
You're still fighting back.

102
00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:22.883
just like your father intended.

103
00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:28.847
So what? You got my dad
hiding in some other room

104
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.932
So you can sic his grief ghost on me?

105
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.185
My phantoms only appear to those
who can grieve them.

106
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.230
Which is why you won't be
having any visitors.

107
00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:39.733
-What the hell does that mean?
-It's simple.

108
00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:41.735
You don't have anyone to grieve.

109
00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:43.820
because your grief isn't real.

110
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.156
I wish I knew that all those nights

111
00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:48.116
I was drinking away my pain
at O'Shaughnessy's.

112
00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:52.037
The sadness you've experienced
in your existence

113
00:06:52.621 --> 00:06:56.291
is just a copy. an echo of real emotion.

114
00:06:57.542 --> 00:07:00.670
Like all of your feelings. Like you.

115
00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:03.256
You are so full of it.

116
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.384
Then why can't I sense
any loss inside your mind?

117
00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:11.723
Why can't I smell those hormones
dancing along your neural receptors?

118
00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:15.518
It's because when Thomas
built you in his lab.

119
00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:18.521
he gave you everything
you need to protect Caitlin.

120
00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:22.192
Cryo-kineticism. healing. rage.

121
00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:27.197
But as for the rest of you.
he just copied what was inside her.

122
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.618
He cloned a few scraps of her feelings.
tinkered with her personality traits.

123
00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:35.580
But he never gave you
any authentic emotions.

124
00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:39.376
He never built you
your own consciousness. your own soul.

125
00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:42.963
-That's not true.
-Grief and pain.

126
00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:48.093
those are the things that make people
truly alive. and you don't have them.

127
00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:49.010
Shut up.

128
00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:53.390
Because you are not a real person.
You're a faulty experiment.

129
00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:56.393
a broken mirror who can't
aid me in my cause like the others.

130
00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:58.144
I said shut the hell up!

131
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:08.697
Come on. come on! In here.

132
00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:18.248
Let me guess.
your ghost dad's back. too?

133
00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:19.541
Yeah. I lost him in the hall.

134
00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:21.167
I don't get it.

135
00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:22.377
These things can walk through walls.

136
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.962
Why the hell aren't they coming in here?

137
00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:26.715
I don't know. But is it getting
kind of toasty in here?

138
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.674
Yeah.

139
00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:31.845
Oh. crap! The doors.

140
00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:33.972
There's no way out.

141
00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:37.600
They chased us in here on purpose.

142
00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:43.732
No. this isn't real.

143
00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:47.402
You're not my mom.

144
00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.780
Argh!

145
00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:54.200
Please. sweetie. stop.
You're gonna hurt yourself.

146
00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:57.954
This is just another manipulation.

147
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.750
Just some part of Deathstorm
trying to screw with my head.

148
00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:03.960
Why would you say this about me?
I'm your mom.

149
00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:04.919
No. you're not.

150
00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:08.548
I came here to help you
because I love you so much.

151
00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:11.885
You have to believe me.

152
00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:16.139
I've been watching you. your life.

153
00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:18.600
what's happening to Iris.

154
00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:22.312
There's no cure
for her temporal sickness.

155
00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:24.022
No secret answer.

156
00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:27.150
You're going to lose her forever.

157
00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:29.736
That's not true.

158
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.572
Her condition's stabilizing.
I can still save her.

159
00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:33.531
Like you saved me?

160
00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:36.159
I'm trying to warn you. Barry.

161
00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:38.369
You can't have a family.

162
00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:40.580
Your father died.

163
00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:42.332
I died.

164
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.251
And now your poor. sick wife
is going to die. too.

165
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.546
And there's nothing you can do
to stop it.

166
00:09:58.723 --> 00:09:59.933
Sure I can't get you a cup?

167
00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:02.102
Oh. no. thank you.

168
00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:04.604
Eddie.

169
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:11.528
You know what sounds great right now?

170
00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:13.071
Some soup.

171
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:14.572
Soup? Really?

172
00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:17.534
Why don't I whip up some of
Uncle Robern's famous chicken noodle?

173
00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:19.744
Oh. yeah. Yummy. babe.

174
00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:21.579
Okay. I'm gonna need some chicken stock.

175
00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:25.083
Um. uh...

176
00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:28.378
You know what would be great
with that. too?

177
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.630
Some chipotle chilies.

178
00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:31.965
Yummy.

179
00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:32.882
Do we have any?

180
00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:36.553
Yeah. I'm sure they're in there.
Just keep looking.

181
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.639
Nope. not seeing any chilies.

182
00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.393
But I do see you. Sue Dearbon.

183
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.603
-Argh!
-Come on. Let's go.

184
00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:53.319
Come on. guys.

185
00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:57.866
You know nobody's leaving
till Iris is all better.

186
00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:04.706
The team's trapped.

187
00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:05.665
How's Caity doing?

188
00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:09.544
It feels like she's getting worse.
and I have no idea why.

189
00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:11.921
Oh. God!

190
00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:13.673
There's something coming.

191
00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:16.926
It's more grief.

192
00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:19.804
Caity. no.

193
00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:25.727
Her vitals are spiking
and she's burning up.

194
00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:29.314
She keeps changing.
and Deathstorm is nowhere near.

195
00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:30.315
No...

196
00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:32.150
It's not Deathstorm.

197
00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:34.402
I have felt this grief before.

198
00:11:34.485 --> 00:11:36.696
It's the team's. It's Barry's

199
00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:40.408
and Allegra's and Chester's and Iris.

200
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.954
I can feel all of their pain
and their sadness

201
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.083
flooding out of them
and pouring into Caitlin.

202
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:52.837
That's why he sent the ghosts
after them.

203
00:11:53.087 --> 00:11:55.632
The more grief they feel.
the more goes into Caity.

204
00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:58.009
And the sooner she becomes his bride.

205
00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:59.844
Burn.

206
00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:01.471
Burn.

207
00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:04.724
War. Home.

208
00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:17.153
Please tell me you can do something
to stop this grief.

209
00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:19.280
Or you can use your powers
to help her somehow.

210
00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:21.115
Frost. I am sure as hell gonna try.

211
00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:23.284
Everybody decent?

212
00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:26.037
Finally. What took you so long?

213
00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.956
The cryogenics department
at Fast Track Labs

214
00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:29.582
has really improved
the security recently.

215
00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:31.042
Just not as much as they thought.

216
00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:32.543
Et voila. madame.

217
00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:34.879
Your very own cryo-circuit.

218
00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:37.257
Well. you must be the infamous Mark.

219
00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:41.094
This baby here
should modify the MAC no problem.

220
00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:43.304
And then we can temporarily
transform you into...

221
00:12:44.347 --> 00:12:45.765
I'm sorry.
What are we transforming you into again?

222
00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:47.183
The anti-Deathstorm.

223
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:51.479
Right. Man. you kids on Team Flash
do some crazy stuff.

224
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.151
-Is Caitlin gonna be okay?
-Yes.

225
00:12:57.235 --> 00:12:59.362
As soon as we get the MAC working.
Let's go.

226
00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:02.949
I got her.

227
00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:15.128
Okay.

228
00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:17.588
Trying to blast a hole in the door
is out.

229
00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:19.966
What the frak
is this thing made of? Titanium?

230
00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:21.634
Actually. yes.

231
00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:23.720
And all my tech just bricked

232
00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:25.430
from the heat.

233
00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:28.558
And then the thermostat died at...

234
00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:32.020
1377

235
00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:35.606
Great. So not only
are we trapped in here.

236
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.400
but we don't know how hot it is?

237
00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:41.904
Humans don't go hyperthermic till
200 degrees Fahrenheit. give or take.

238
00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:45.116
-which means that--
-You've got about 20 minutes.

239
00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:50.371
When your internal temperature
reaches 105 degrees.

240
00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:51.998
blood flow starts to decrease.

241
00:13:52.373 --> 00:13:55.126
At 107. organs fail
and brain function slows.

242
00:13:55.209 --> 00:13:56.711
By about 109...

243
00:13:58.296 --> 00:13:59.464
you'll believe in quitting.

244
00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:01.674
Don't listen to him. Chuck.

245
00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:03.593
Nothing he says means anything.

246
00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:06.095
"Chuck"?

247
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:07.805
You let her call you that?

248
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.475
No. no. she's right.

249
00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:14.562
You're not real.
I'm getting that door open.

250
00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:20.068
Why do we love science. Chester?

251
00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.362
Because regardless of who's

252
00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:25.865
conducting the experiment.
the results are right and wrong.

253
00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:27.241
Black and white.

254
00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:31.079
Just like this situation.

255
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.500
Whether I'm real or not.
you care about each other.

256
00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:40.671
And here you are. trapped in a room.

257
00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:45.885
Forced to watch each other die.

258
00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:51.224
And when you do...

259
00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:07.365
I'm done with your games.

260
00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:09.909
You could burn me alive right now.

261
00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:12.203
But you won't.
So tell me. what do you want?

262
00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:13.579
I want to prepare you. Barry.

263
00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:16.791
Iris' impending death
won't just mean that she's gone.

264
00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:20.711
it will mean that Nora and Bart
will never exist.

265
00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:24.215
I'm not trying to be cruel.

266
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:29.053
But the truth is.
your legacy isn't heroism.

267
00:15:32.223 --> 00:15:33.266
It's heartbreak.

268
00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.937
You know what people like you
will never understand?

269
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:43.818
Love is a strength. not a liability.

270
00:15:45.027 --> 00:15:45.945
The heartbreak

271
00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.865
that I've suffered.
the people I've lost.

272
00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:52.493
they don't hold me back.

273
00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:55.204
They make me fight that much harder.

274
00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.040
And I'm going to fight for Iris.

275
00:15:58.124 --> 00:15:59.333
Then why didn't you fight for me?

276
00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:02.962
Why did you stand by
while Thawne stabbed me in the gut?

277
00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:04.297
Thawne didn't kill you!

278
00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:07.592
He killed my mom.

279
00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:14.599
And as much as it hurt.
I have accepted her death.

280
00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:19.061
And what about the rest of them?

281
00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:24.484
Thank you for everything.

282
00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:30.823
Have you accepted all their deaths too?

283
00:16:32.366 --> 00:16:36.078
Barry told us about Deathstorm and
the ghost that he sent after Chester.

284
00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:37.663
You're one of those apparitions.
aren't you?

285
00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:41.292
And where's your precious Barry now?

286
00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:44.086
Nowhere to be found. as usual.

287
00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:48.466
while you're laid up in here.
waiting to die.

288
00:16:49.592 --> 00:16:51.469
Iris is not going to die.

289
00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:53.095
Trust me.

290
00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:57.391
As a dead man myself. she's toast.

291
00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:00.603
And she knows it.

292
00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:03.940
Just like I knew.

293
00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:07.777
I thought my sacrifice
would mean something.

294
00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:11.447
That I could erase
the Reverse Flash from existence.

295
00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:16.285
That finally... I could be a hero.

296
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:20.748
But then Eobard Thawne came back.

297
00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:26.212
Again and again. and again and again.

298
00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:28.548
What I did...

299
00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:31.676
it didn't matter at all.

300
00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:35.596
I died for nothing.

301
00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:39.600
And now you've made the same mistake.

302
00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:42.770
You sacrificed yourself for nothing.

303
00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:44.355
I saved Barry...

304
00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:47.692
and I helped stop Armageddon.

305
00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:48.901
Then what happened?

306
00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:53.072
The timeline got reset. but you're
still suffering the consequences.

307
00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:58.703
Can't you see? Your death
is gonna be just as pointless as mine.

308
00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:04.542
Something's wrong.

309
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:10.214
Why are you... happy?

310
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.008
Who? Me?

311
00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:14.093
Oh. well. that's easy.

312
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.554
I'm young. I'm rich.

313
00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:17.888
I'm a total dime.

314
00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:20.683
And before you so rudely destroyed

315
00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:24.228
another one of my brand-new phones.
I hit the panic button.

316
00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:26.188
Hey. Detective Pretty Boy.

317
00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:31.110
Come on. before it wears off. Come on.

318
00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:36.532
Nana?

319
00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:39.702
No. please don't go.

320
00:18:40.911 --> 00:18:41.871
Chyre...

321
00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:45.625
Chyre. hold on. man. please. Chyre.

322
00:18:46.709 --> 00:18:47.585
What did you do to them?

323
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:50.838
I showed them the deaths
of the people they love.

324
00:18:53.424 --> 00:18:55.343
And now. with the help of their grief.

325
00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:59.555
the bride's transformation
will be complete.

326
00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:07.104
All right. Cryo-circuit's functional.

327
00:19:07.396 --> 00:19:09.148
Ready to merge your cold fusion cells

328
00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:11.150
with Douchestorm's
dimensional particles.

329
00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:16.530
This has to work.

330
00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:19.450
Hey. master cryogeneticist over here.

331
00:19:19.533 --> 00:19:20.618
Not just a pretty face.

332
00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:21.619
Trust me.

333
00:19:22.453 --> 00:19:23.371
Okay.

334
00:19:23.537 --> 00:19:24.872
Cryo-circuit is alive.

335
00:19:24.955 --> 00:19:27.083
Activating augmentation receptors.

336
00:19:32.046 --> 00:19:33.506
Deploying dimensional particles.

337
00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:49.939
Hey. are you okay?

338
00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:51.232
Did it work?

339
00:19:52.358 --> 00:19:55.319
-Are you anti-Deathstorm?
-Only one way to find out.

340
00:20:05.496 --> 00:20:06.455
What's wrong?

341
00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:08.332
I'm just me.

342
00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.459
No fire powers. no nothing.

343
00:20:10.543 --> 00:20:12.336
This stupid machine didn't work.

344
00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:14.463
I mean. that doesn't make sense.

345
00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:19.385
It should work on anyone. any organism
or sentient being with a consciousness.

346
00:20:20.594 --> 00:20:22.930
Or anyone who's truly alive.

347
00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.225
I guess we know
what the issue here is then.

348
00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:29.645
It's me.

349
00:20:38.362 --> 00:20:39.739
How can you be the problem?

350
00:20:40.114 --> 00:20:42.700
-It doesn't make sense.
-You said it yourself.

351
00:20:42.783 --> 00:20:44.744
The reaction depends on the MAC

352
00:20:44.827 --> 00:20:47.121
being able to put particles
in someone's consciousness.

353
00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:49.915
What if that person doesn't have one?

354
00:20:50.833 --> 00:20:52.042
What are you talking about?

355
00:20:52.126 --> 00:20:53.669
I mean. of course
you have a consciousness.

356
00:20:53.961 --> 00:20:55.504
Not according to Deathstorm.

357
00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:59.884
He and I had a little chat
about why everyone on Team Flash

358
00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:01.761
got visited by a ghost except me.

359
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:07.224
He said that I couldn't experience grief

360
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.976
because when Thomas created me.

361
00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:11.645
he just gave me a copy
of all of Caity's emotions.

362
00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:14.523
He's obviously just messing with you.

363
00:21:15.566 --> 00:21:17.359
Don't let that fire freak
get in your head.

364
00:21:19.069 --> 00:21:20.112
What if he's not?

365
00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:23.824
Do you know what my earliest memory is?

366
00:21:25.659 --> 00:21:27.953
It's not of Carla singing me a lullaby

367
00:21:28.037 --> 00:21:29.872
or Thomas throwing me on his shoulders.

368
00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:33.167
It's of Caity being hit by a car.

369
00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:40.382
'Cause that's the first time I woke up.

370
00:21:41.008 --> 00:21:41.926
To take the hit.

371
00:21:44.178 --> 00:21:47.848
And then I just drifted back
into her subconsciousness.

372
00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:50.559
locked away there for years.

373
00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:56.982
Watching Caity live her life
and have friends.

374
00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:01.987
You know. so when I finally
started coming out more.

375
00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:05.324
I wanted to make up
for lost time. you know?

376
00:22:06.492 --> 00:22:08.494
Finally live a life.

377
00:22:12.581 --> 00:22:14.917
Boy. was I stupid
for ever thinking that was possible.

378
00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:18.254
'Cause it doesn't matter.

379
00:22:19.713 --> 00:22:21.590
Doesn't matter how many
life coaches I get.

380
00:22:21.674 --> 00:22:24.176
or if I get my own body

381
00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.262
or do a bunch of art.
or get my own boyfriend.

382
00:22:28.013 --> 00:22:29.098
Because I'll always

383
00:22:29.807 --> 00:22:31.851
just be a copy of the original.

384
00:22:32.977 --> 00:22:33.894
An echo.

385
00:22:35.813 --> 00:22:37.356
‘Cause I've never been really alive.

386
00:22:38.941 --> 00:22:40.484
And now that's gonna get Caity killed.

387
00:22:43.988 --> 00:22:44.864
Frost...

388
00:22:48.576 --> 00:22:51.495
If you are not really alive.
where does that leave me?

389
00:22:52.913 --> 00:22:55.499
You're the only person I've ever
cared about more than myself.

390
00:22:56.542 --> 00:22:59.587
Or at least equal to myself.

391
00:23:00.838 --> 00:23:02.339
I guess we're both screwed up. then.

392
00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:04.592
Yeah. that's definitely true.

393
00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:12.099
But the way I see it. you and I
have been through a lot. right?

394
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:15.519
And through all of those ups and downs.

395
00:23:16.186 --> 00:23:19.189
I. for one. have seen you have
loads of emotions. all kinds.

396
00:23:20.858 --> 00:23:22.318
Especially when it comes to Caitlin.

397
00:23:23.319 --> 00:23:25.321
You love your sister like crazy.

398
00:23:26.322 --> 00:23:27.781
And wherever that love came from.

399
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.200
whether you were born with it.

400
00:23:30.534 --> 00:23:32.036
or your dad gave it to you.

401
00:23:32.995 --> 00:23:36.790
or you put it together yourself
over time.

402
00:23:37.041 --> 00:23:38.667
built it with pain and heartache...

403
00:23:40.753 --> 00:23:44.006
That love is as real as it gets.

404
00:23:46.759 --> 00:23:47.760
Believe me.

405
00:23:52.681 --> 00:23:54.892
Then why didn't Deathstorm
use any of my grief?

406
00:23:55.643 --> 00:23:58.270
He said he couldn't even find it in me.

407
00:23:58.812 --> 00:24:00.522
Maybe he couldn't find it
because you've got it

408
00:24:00.606 --> 00:24:02.566
buried so deep
in that foxy head of yours.

409
00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:06.070
Maybe because you love so damn hard.

410
00:24:06.695 --> 00:24:08.530
and you know the flip side
would totally suck.

411
00:24:10.824 --> 00:24:12.952
Yeah. I mean.
I have been a little closed off lately.

412
00:24:15.663 --> 00:24:16.747
I'm sorry. Snowflake.

413
00:24:18.415 --> 00:24:22.628
Grief is a necessary part of life
and you are very much alive.

414
00:24:26.548 --> 00:24:27.466
That's it.

415
00:24:27.841 --> 00:24:28.676
Yes!

416
00:24:30.511 --> 00:24:32.596
Frost. the MAC's been
working fine all along.

417
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:36.350
But the chemical reaction
was missing a necessary ingredient.

418
00:24:37.893 --> 00:24:40.187
Frost. I think I know how to finish
your transformation.

419
00:24:43.107 --> 00:24:45.109
Sue. Dad. it's not real.

420
00:24:45.734 --> 00:24:47.695
You guys. you're stronger
than this bastard.

421
00:24:48.654 --> 00:24:50.739
That's no way to talk about your fiancé.

422
00:24:52.032 --> 00:24:53.325
I know you want our grief.

423
00:24:54.034 --> 00:24:55.411
But you're not gonna get an ounce
from me.

424
00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.496
I know you are not the real Eddie.

425
00:24:57.913 --> 00:25:00.249
No. I'm not.

426
00:25:01.875 --> 00:25:02.793
Because he died.

427
00:25:07.131 --> 00:25:08.757
Just like you're gonna die. too.

428
00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:14.471
No. it's not real.

429
00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.682
Yes. it is.

430
00:25:17.933 --> 00:25:20.227
Now you're gonna lose everything. Iris.

431
00:25:20.853 --> 00:25:22.771
Your family. your future.

432
00:25:23.564 --> 00:25:25.274
Everything you worked so hard for.

433
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.445
It hurts. doesn't it?

434
00:25:46.795 --> 00:25:49.131
You and I. we had history.

435
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:51.759
But you and him had a future.

436
00:25:52.926 --> 00:25:55.304
And that's so much worse. isn't it?

437
00:25:56.597 --> 00:25:58.390
Because you're not just
watching him die.

438
00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:02.853
You're watching everything
you could have shared die. too.

439
00:26:07.024 --> 00:26:08.067
You can try all you want.

440
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:09.568
but you'll never get out of here. son.

441
00:26:13.072 --> 00:26:14.031
And neither will she.

442
00:26:15.783 --> 00:26:16.784
She's gonna die...

443
00:26:17.951 --> 00:26:19.912
because you're not smart enough
to find a way out.

444
00:26:22.915 --> 00:26:25.167
All that time tinkering with machines.

445
00:26:25.959 --> 00:26:27.711
building countless gadgets.

446
00:26:27.795 --> 00:26:30.756
and the one time you need
to come up with a big idea.

447
00:26:30.881 --> 00:26:32.633
the one time it really matters...

448
00:26:34.426 --> 00:26:35.761
you can't do a damn thing.

449
00:26:39.181 --> 00:26:41.683
Chuck... I got you.

450
00:26:42.726 --> 00:26:43.560
It's okay.

451
00:26:45.062 --> 00:26:47.106
It's... It's not okay.

452
00:26:47.231 --> 00:26:49.358
It's not okay. I'm so sorry
I couldn't fix this. Allegra.

453
00:26:50.734 --> 00:26:52.277
No. don't feel bad.

454
00:26:53.112 --> 00:26:54.446
That's how they want us to feel.

455
00:26:56.198 --> 00:26:59.868
But Chuck. the truth is...

456
00:27:00.953 --> 00:27:04.832
right now. with you.

457
00:27:05.791 --> 00:27:09.878
I feel happy. Happy I met you.

458
00:27:13.132 --> 00:27:15.843
Me. too. Me. too.

459
00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.480
Oliver traded his life for yours.

460
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:29.690
Stop! Stop it!

461
00:27:29.773 --> 00:27:32.776
No! You stop fighting. Barry.
Give in to the pain.

462
00:27:33.277 --> 00:27:34.611
The pain you still feel.

463
00:27:35.237 --> 00:27:37.156
Let your sorrow wash over you.

464
00:27:39.116 --> 00:27:41.285
So the bride may be reborn.

465
00:27:43.287 --> 00:27:44.830
I can see them.

466
00:27:46.248 --> 00:27:49.835
Stars. endless stars.

467
00:27:52.421 --> 00:27:53.422
Hey. Caity.

468
00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:58.177
I'm not even sure if you can hear me.

469
00:27:59.178 --> 00:28:00.554
but there's something I need to say.

470
00:28:04.224 --> 00:28:07.895
You know. I used to be afraid
that because we shared a body.

471
00:28:10.022 --> 00:28:12.858
I was only gonna get to live
half a life.

472
00:28:13.609 --> 00:28:15.319
That I was only gonna be half a person.

473
00:28:17.988 --> 00:28:20.532
I realize now that isn't true.

474
00:28:24.828 --> 00:28:26.455
You didn't take anything from me.

475
00:28:30.459 --> 00:28:33.128
In fact. it's just the opposite.

476
00:28:38.008 --> 00:28:39.635
You make my life complete.

477
00:28:43.555 --> 00:28:44.890
And I got to be honest.
I'm a little worried

478
00:28:44.973 --> 00:28:46.475
we're not going to make it out of this.

479
00:28:48.352 --> 00:28:49.770
And that I might lose you forever.

480
00:28:53.774 --> 00:28:55.025
And I can't handle that.

481
00:28:55.984 --> 00:28:56.985
I would die.

482
00:29:02.241 --> 00:29:03.825
I love you more than anything.

483
00:29:10.207 --> 00:29:11.500
Is that what's supposed to happen?

484
00:29:11.625 --> 00:29:12.584
Argh!

485
00:29:18.632 --> 00:29:20.092
The MAC's been working fine all along.

486
00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:22.469
But the chemical reaction
was missing one ingredient.

487
00:29:22.552 --> 00:29:24.596
the spark that gave Deathstorm life.

488
00:29:25.472 --> 00:29:26.306
Grief.

489
00:29:27.266 --> 00:29:28.934
Frost just had to let herself feel it.

490
00:29:39.403 --> 00:29:42.322
Damn! I've never felt this warm before.

491
00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:43.782
It's all that power.

492
00:29:44.241 --> 00:29:47.577
Frost. I can feel it
radiating off of you.

493
00:29:48.412 --> 00:29:52.416
That's ‘cause I'm not just Frost...
I'm Hellfrost.

494
00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.440
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

495
00:30:21.445 --> 00:30:23.488
Sue. Dad. are you guys okay?

496
00:30:23.864 --> 00:30:25.032
Yeah. I'm okay. We're okay.

497
00:30:26.074 --> 00:30:26.992
The team...

498
00:30:28.869 --> 00:30:29.703
They're all okay.

499
00:30:30.746 --> 00:30:31.705
So. hot stuff...

500
00:30:32.956 --> 00:30:33.957
what do we do now?

501
00:30:34.708 --> 00:30:35.959
We kick some ass

502
00:30:36.918 --> 00:30:38.211
and save my sister.

503
00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.595
You look totally badass.

504
00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:48.388
Thanks. I feel badass.

505
00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:51.266
But Caity's not okay.
In fact. Cecile says she's worse.

506
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:52.392
Then this isn't over.

507
00:30:52.726 --> 00:30:54.561
Deathstorm is back
in his home dimension.

508
00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.688
which means he can still
put guilt inside of Caitlin.

509
00:30:56.772 --> 00:30:58.357
Or send more ghosts after you guys.

510
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:02.069
Yeah. I talked to Iris.
Deathstorm sent one to the loft.

511
00:31:03.153 --> 00:31:04.196
You saved the whole team.

512
00:31:04.404 --> 00:31:05.781
And now I'm gonna save Caity

513
00:31:06.073 --> 00:31:08.116
by extinguishing this son of a bitch.

514
00:31:08.283 --> 00:31:10.410
Hey. when that thing comes back.
you're gonna need some backup.

515
00:31:10.494 --> 00:31:12.496
No. I'm the only one who can do this.

516
00:31:13.038 --> 00:31:14.331
Even Barry's lightning can't stop him.

517
00:31:14.414 --> 00:31:17.042
-And if anything goes wrong?
-You'll get me out of there in a flash.

518
00:31:19.544 --> 00:31:22.422
Okay. wait. Flash. lightning...
Are you saying that he...

519
00:31:24.925 --> 00:31:25.759
Whoa.

520
00:31:29.346 --> 00:31:30.722
But if he can't help you.

521
00:31:31.056 --> 00:31:32.808
you've got to let me try
adjusting my gauntlets.

522
00:31:32.891 --> 00:31:35.143
-I can pump up the cryo-kinetic outputs.
-There's no time.

523
00:31:35.727 --> 00:31:37.771
Then maybe we need to make some time.

524
00:31:37.854 --> 00:31:40.565
Look. I told you. I was born for this.

525
00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.777
But I'll give you something
to remember me by.

526
00:31:52.202 --> 00:31:54.121
-Damn.
-There's more where that came from.

527
00:31:57.874 --> 00:31:58.792
Did I break you?

528
00:32:00.043 --> 00:32:01.503
No. I...

529
00:32:04.047 --> 00:32:05.215
Go save your sister.

530
00:32:05.841 --> 00:32:06.967
I'll be here when you get back.

531
00:32:12.806 --> 00:32:15.016
Okay.
You guys do this all the time?

532
00:32:15.517 --> 00:32:17.060
Yep. That's the gig.

533
00:32:17.394 --> 00:32:18.770
How do you stay so calm. man?

534
00:32:19.354 --> 00:32:21.064
It's nerve-racking as hell.

535
00:32:21.815 --> 00:32:23.608
Welcome to Superheroing 101.

536
00:32:29.322 --> 00:32:30.240
This is it.

537
00:32:42.169 --> 00:32:45.005
I can sense all that precious grief
inside you. Cait.

538
00:32:46.298 --> 00:32:47.591
You're almost ready.

539
00:32:49.593 --> 00:32:52.137
I've waited so long to end my solitude.

540
00:32:52.846 --> 00:32:54.723
It's time to start our honeymoon.
my bride.

541
00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:58.185
because I want forever
to start right now.

542
00:33:02.022 --> 00:33:02.856
Surprise!

543
00:33:05.442 --> 00:33:06.276
What have you done?

544
00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:07.569
Now let's party.

545
00:33:13.658 --> 00:33:14.701
Are you sure she can do this?

546
00:33:15.202 --> 00:33:16.119
We have to trust her.

547
00:33:21.958 --> 00:33:23.668
I will burn you to ash.

548
00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:27.214
You first!

549
00:33:31.301 --> 00:33:33.178
Come on. Frost. Give him hell.

550
00:34:01.289 --> 00:34:04.000
You can't keep me from my bride.

551
00:34:04.084 --> 00:34:05.585
Who do you think you are?

552
00:34:06.503 --> 00:34:07.837
More than you can handle.

553
00:34:08.505 --> 00:34:09.506
Go to hell!

554
00:34:13.718 --> 00:34:15.387
Now it's time for me to feed.

555
00:34:36.283 --> 00:34:37.659
That's it. party people.

556
00:34:38.118 --> 00:34:41.830
All traces of supplemental cold fusion
and barometric anomalies are gone.

557
00:34:44.916 --> 00:34:45.750
What happened?

558
00:34:46.751 --> 00:34:47.752
Frost saved you.

559
00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:53.425
Hellfrost. you did it.

560
00:34:53.717 --> 00:34:54.634
Hell yeah. I did.

561
00:34:54.968 --> 00:34:55.927
That's my gal.

562
00:34:56.595 --> 00:34:57.429
How's Caity?

563
00:35:01.266 --> 00:35:02.142
She's doing fine.

564
00:35:02.434 --> 00:35:03.310
Thank God.

565
00:35:03.685 --> 00:35:06.646
Hey. I have a bourbon straight up
waiting for you when you get back.

566
00:35:06.855 --> 00:35:07.731
Sounds great.

567
00:35:09.816 --> 00:35:11.192
Guys. I'm not feeling so hot.

568
00:35:15.989 --> 00:35:17.657
-Her vitals are crashing.
-What?

569
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:21.953
Frost.

570
00:35:35.342 --> 00:35:37.594
You just woke up from a coma.
Are you sure you're up for this?

571
00:35:37.677 --> 00:35:38.720
I have to be.

572
00:35:39.262 --> 00:35:40.847
-What the hell happened?
-Mark. hey. hey--

573
00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:42.223
-Why isn't she moving?
-We don't know.

574
00:35:42.307 --> 00:35:45.602
We don't know. But Caitlin is working
on her. and she is going to save her.

575
00:35:46.478 --> 00:35:47.937
-Okay. I can help.
-No. you can't.

576
00:35:48.021 --> 00:35:49.272
I'm sorry. but you need to leave.

577
00:35:49.356 --> 00:35:51.316
-I can't--
-Mark. hey. it's going to be okay.

578
00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:52.359
Caitlin has to focus.

579
00:35:52.442 --> 00:35:55.153
Hey. let's just give them
some space. yeah?

580
00:35:57.739 --> 00:36:00.367
Okay. her pupils are dilated.
Her heart rate's spiking. Talk to me.

581
00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:01.493
Tell me what happened out there.

582
00:36:01.576 --> 00:36:03.620
We manipulated her cryo powers
in the MAC

583
00:36:03.703 --> 00:36:05.246
so that she could absorb
Deathstorm's energy.

584
00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:06.247
It's what saved you.

585
00:36:06.331 --> 00:36:07.666
But Deathstorm's been doing this
for a millennia.

586
00:36:07.749 --> 00:36:10.168
So I'm guessing he can
handle a lot more power than she can.

587
00:36:10.752 --> 00:36:13.254
She's going into cardiac arrest.

588
00:36:16.049 --> 00:36:17.634
Okay. I'm gonna inject her
with cold fusion.

589
00:36:17.717 --> 00:36:20.595
That'll bring Frost back
and that'll kick in her ice healing.

590
00:36:28.937 --> 00:36:31.314
Come on. Frost. come back to me.

591
00:36:50.166 --> 00:36:51.000
You did it.

592
00:37:06.433 --> 00:37:08.101
No. No. no. no. that's impossible.

593
00:37:08.393 --> 00:37:09.644
Her ice healing. it's not kicking in.

594
00:37:09.728 --> 00:37:11.312
She's flatlining. Get me the paddles.

595
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.314
Here. here.

596
00:37:15.608 --> 00:37:16.443
Clear.

597
00:37:19.696 --> 00:37:20.613
Clear.

598
00:37:54.981 --> 00:37:55.815
Caitlin.

599
00:37:58.693 --> 00:37:59.986
Caitlin. Caitlin.

600
00:38:30.683 --> 00:38:33.102
C.C.P.D. has lifted the citywide curfew

601
00:38:33.186 --> 00:38:35.396
after confirming that.
as of an hour ago.

602
00:38:35.522 --> 00:38:38.608
the mysterious mass murderer
plaguing our city is no longer a threat.

603
00:38:38.942 --> 00:38:41.319
Citizens are cleared to fully resume
their normal--

604
00:38:41.402 --> 00:38:43.488
Well. Deathstorm's finally gone.

605
00:38:44.614 --> 00:38:45.907
Frost is a real hero.

606
00:38:47.408 --> 00:38:49.369
Caitlin and Barry have been
in there forever.

607
00:38:50.245 --> 00:38:51.538
Frost is gonna pull through.

608
00:38:54.624 --> 00:38:55.625
You doing okay. Mark?

609
00:38:58.127 --> 00:38:59.003
Yeah. thanks.

610
00:38:59.546 --> 00:39:01.130
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
you know.

611
00:39:03.758 --> 00:39:06.594
Frost and I had a lot of plans.

612
00:39:08.221 --> 00:39:10.014
Like I scored this trip
to the Himalayas.

613
00:39:10.098 --> 00:39:11.558
where you jump out of a chopper

614
00:39:11.641 --> 00:39:15.019
and snowboard down.
and at the bottom. at base camp.

615
00:39:15.103 --> 00:39:19.065
they have this cute little restaurant
where every dessert is made of ice.

616
00:39:20.316 --> 00:39:22.694
I know she's probably gonna say
it's stupid.

617
00:39:23.152 --> 00:39:26.072
but then secretly not hate it at all.

618
00:39:26.906 --> 00:39:28.491
Kind of like how she feels about me.

619
00:39:32.287 --> 00:39:33.705
I just wanna make her smile.

620
00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:39.419
There's nothing better than that.

621
00:39:40.753 --> 00:39:42.422
Well. she's lucky
to have you in her life.

622
00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:45.258
We all know I'm lucky
to have her in mine.

623
00:39:49.971 --> 00:39:50.805
Barry.

624
00:40:01.316 --> 00:40:02.650
Something happened.

625
00:40:08.031 --> 00:40:08.907
Where is she?

626
00:40:12.952 --> 00:40:13.995
Come on. where is she?

627
00:40:16.748 --> 00:40:17.874
Frost died.

628
00:40:25.798 --> 00:40:27.216
That's not possible.

629
00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:32.722
I'm sorry. She didn't make it.

630
00:40:34.307 --> 00:40:35.141
She's gone.

631
00:40:35.165 --> 00:40:43.165
