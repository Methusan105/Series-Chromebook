00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.601
Look at them.

2
00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.853
Praying for a miracle that isn't coming.

3
00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:21.855
Who knows?

4
00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.192
Maybe it's my curse to leave
one betrayal behind.

5
00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:28.820
only to find a greater one
here amongst the stars.

6
00:00:29.613 --> 00:00:31.323
They could've stopped this.

7
00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:35.077
But none of them had the strength
to do what must be done.

8
00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:37.538
But I do.

9
00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.288
So what is it like walking
to go get coffee when you can run

10
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:20.789
4.000 miles an hour?

11
00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:24.001
It's nice slowing down every once
in a while. even for the Flash.

12
00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.210
Is Frost joining us?

13
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.630
No. Last night I sent her on
a two week Eat Pray Love tour

14
00:01:28.714 --> 00:01:30.882
because she's still
pining over Mark Blaine.

15
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.759
I thought she was mad at him all summer.

16
00:01:32.843 --> 00:01:33.760
And fall.

17
00:01:33.844 --> 00:01:36.388
But she still misses him.
even though I told her

18
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.557
he's a jerk who is
never going to change.

19
00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:40.142
Let me guess. she didn't care?

20
00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:41.476
Yep. she said.

21
00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:43.437
"The heart wants what the heart wants."

22
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.397
She's always been such a romantic.

23
00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:54.406
I have learned one thing
watching Frost go through all this.

24
00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:56.783
For the first time since Ronnie passed.

25
00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:00.704
I think I'm really ready
to get back out there.

26
00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:04.499
I'm... gonna start dating again.

27
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.169
That's awesome.
I'm really happy for you.

28
00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:10.130
Thank you. Now if I can just get
some oat milk for my coffee.

29
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.552
Two bullet trains on the Calvert Railway
are going to collide.

30
00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:17.679
Barry. that's 50 miles
south of Keystone City.

31
00:02:17.763 --> 00:02:18.722
Yeah.

32
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.577
Ladies and gentlemen.
authorities are now confirming

33
00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:45.290
that despite a massive explosion
caused by today's railway accident.

34
00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:49.086
no lives were lost
during this horrific event.

35
00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.964
It appears our city
has the Flash to thank once more.

36
00:02:56.468 --> 00:02:58.095
That was amazing!

37
00:02:58.804 --> 00:03:01.056
You got everyone to safety
in what. 20 seconds?

38
00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:03.767
Twelve actually. Try your coffee.

39
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:12.109
Wow. You have seriously leveled up.

40
00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.611
If only you could teach Frost
how to do the same.

41
00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:17.656
I mean. bypassing anyone
who calls themselves "Chillblaine."

42
00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.074
I think would save her
a lot of heartbreak.

43
00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:23.120
I mean. Frost dating anybody.
is a first for her. right?

44
00:03:23.412 --> 00:03:25.038
And everybody you dated before Ronnie.

45
00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:26.748
I'm guessing that was you leveling up.

46
00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.333
You know. it's a process.

47
00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:31.545
Maybe just give Frost space
to do the same.

48
00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:37.092
Captain Kramer.
while supportive of your transparency...

49
00:03:37.426 --> 00:03:39.636
...you have been criticized
for your decision

50
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.430
to disband the city's meta task force.

51
00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:44.933
Some people thinking that it will
increase meta-crime across the city.

52
00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:46.435
Do you care to comment?

53
00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:53.233
Once I came to terms with being a meta.
it helped me realize how important it is

54
00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:58.113
for everyone in Central City to receive
equal protections under the same laws.

55
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.325
So you felt as though the meta
task force was unfairly targeting

56
00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:04.327
marginalized sections of the populace.

57
00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:07.038
Yes. which is why its time has passed.

58
00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:09.458
Great. Thank you. Captain Kramer.

59
00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.960
This is Iris West-Allen
for Citizentopia.

60
00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:13.253
Thank you for listening.

61
00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:15.756
That was great.

62
00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.090
It was great. Come in.

63
00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.468
Allegra. you remember Captain Kramer?

64
00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:20.427
- Hi.
- Hi.

65
00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.764
Well. I have an appointment
with Chief Singh.

66
00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:25.140
so. thanks.

67
00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:27.768
You wanted to see me?

68
00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:32.189
Yes. So the last six months
have been pretty intense.

69
00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:37.444
I'll say. We have three new reporters.
an IT intern and an office manager now.

70
00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:39.988
Plus. online circulation's
over two million.

71
00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.240
and your new podcast's
frickin' brilliant.

72
00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:45.285
-Thank you.
-Oh. we need faster internet.

73
00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:46.703
Should we call the new landlord?

74
00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:48.205
Sue Dearbon bought the building.

75
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.165
I think we can fix our own internet.

76
00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:51.082
Roger that.

77
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.710
But seriously. I just
don't see how you do it all

78
00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:55.378
and still find time
for an op-ed each week.

79
00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:56.671
Well. I can't.

80
00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:59.257
So the bullpen needs
a supervising editor.

81
00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:00.884
Someone who decides
which stories we cover

82
00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.386
and then assigns and pre-edits copy.

83
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.474
Which is why I am promoting you.

84
00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.267
Wha... Iris...

85
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.687
Well. I've barely been staff for a year.

86
00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:14.147
I'm not ready for that.

87
00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:17.943
-Well. I think you are.
-You do realize you have people on staff

88
00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:20.153
who are more qualified
to handle that sort of thing?

89
00:05:20.237 --> 00:05:23.490
I mean. Vanya. she's got ten years
of experience under her belt.

90
00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:24.991
Or that annoying Taylor.

91
00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:28.119
just graduated summa cum laude
from Barnard College.

92
00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:30.622
Even the old guy was a war correspondent
in Beirut.

93
00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:34.709
Aariz is my age. Girl!

94
00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:42.592
Look. now that we're
CC Citizen Media. I am busier

95
00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:44.344
with more and more
administrative duties.

96
00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:47.013
-Iris. are you sure?
-You got this.

97
00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:48.431
I believe in you.

98
00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:55.021
What is this?

99
00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:59.192
A candlelit pizza dinner.
from our favorite place in Milan.

100
00:05:59.276 --> 00:06:02.612
Oh. thank God. I was too tired to cook.

101
00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:04.072
I can't imagine why.

102
00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:06.616
Team Citizen's
been in overdrive these days.

103
00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:08.910
Plus. Deon's still helping to stabilize

104
00:06:08.994 --> 00:06:11.329
your temporal sickness
with regular treatments.

105
00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:12.789
It's a lot to handle.

106
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.624
I told you I'm fine.

107
00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.711
Plus. you're not exactly
an underachiever yourself. Flash.

108
00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:19.421
Nice work at Calvert Railway.

109
00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:20.338
Thanks.

110
00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:21.756
I guess we both earned a night off.

111
00:06:21.882 --> 00:06:23.049
And without kids. too.

112
00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:25.343
I mean. don't get me wrong.
It's great having Bart and Nora

113
00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:27.095
stop in all the time from 2049...

114
00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:32.183
But if we're ever going to have a baby.
we need some alone time. Mr. Allen.

115
00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:37.689
-Great.
-Yeah.

116
00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:41.484
-Ray?
-In the flesh.

117
00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:45.697
What. uh... What brings you
to Central City?

118
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.741
Oh. well. you guys said
I could always crash here

119
00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:50.911
if ever I was in town.
and I'm here attending CCTC.

120
00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:54.247
But my hotel is overbooked.
and it's impossible to get

121
00:06:54.331 --> 00:06:55.916
a conference hotel room
at the last minute.

122
00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:59.085
So I figured I'd take you up
on your very kind offer.

123
00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.755
-Oh. that makes sense.
-Doesn't it?

124
00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:06.217
Are you guys having pizza?
Is it gluten-free?

125
00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:09.054
-No. it's from Italy.
-Oh.

126
00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:12.307
So. where is Nora?
Did she come with you?

127
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.768
No. she's saving the world
one kid at a time

128
00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:16.269
and loving it.

129
00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:20.482
Am... Am I interrupting?

130
00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:22.359
-Never.
-No.

131
00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:23.610
Really? Great!

132
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.320
So is this a sofa bed

133
00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:27.447
or like a sheets-and-blankets-on-top
sort of thing?

134
00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:30.992
There is a guest bedroom
at the top of the stairs.

135
00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:33.161
Aw! You guys are the best.

136
00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:36.373
-I'll get the rest of my bags later.
-Okay.

137
00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:41.294
-I thought he could shrink things.
-Yeah.

138
00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:45.382
Trucks at loading dock.

139
00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:47.926
Copy that. Transport team's here.

140
00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:50.762
What the hell?

141
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.401
In three seconds.
the two on the outside

142
00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:06.194
will draw their weapons and advance.

143
00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:07.988
while the other two
hold their positions.

144
00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.572
Jack. you're up.

145
00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:16.037
I could have melted your faces instead.

146
00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:18.164
Guess you drew a lucky hand.

147
00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.251
Ooh. their minds
are full of fear. Ten.

148
00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:23.003
Show them who has the winning hand.

149
00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.010
-Jackpot.
-Oh. crap.

150
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:33.638
My King. you know the drill.

151
00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:45.358
I guess he folded.

152
00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:47.777
-Well. that's no fun.
-Either way.

153
00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:54.242
that was damn fine work. My Queen.

154
00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:58.663
Well. it's easy when you can see
each card before it's dealt.

155
00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:01.291
My Queen.

156
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.641
-Now what?
-We raise the stakes.

157
00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:29.110
There you go. Iris.

158
00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:35.241
Uh. Ray. how often do you talk to Sara
and all the other Legends?

159
00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:37.619
Well. not very often.

160
00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:40.747
Nate and I do have
a standing drinks night once a month.

161
00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:44.334
but he's rarely
in the same century or year.

162
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:46.795
Yeah. that may be
why I haven't heard from him lately.

163
00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:47.879
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:49.047
It's okay.

165
00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:50.548
Kind of.

166
00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:53.676
Yeah. it was really hard
leaving the Legends.

167
00:09:54.385 --> 00:09:58.598
but since then. Nora and I
have been more connected than ever.

168
00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:01.059
And. you know.
I've been able to get back

169
00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:03.770
to my other true love. pure research.

170
00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:05.980
Plus. my life's more balanced now.

171
00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:08.608
It's not just "I'm the Atom.
and science takes a backseat."

172
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:12.028
you know so. yeah. to. uh...
To second acts.

173
00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:15.073
I'll get it.

174
00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:20.411
Is this year's Legacy Honoree
in the house?

175
00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:21.538
Hey. Chester. Yeah. come on in.

176
00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:24.958
Chester. Ray. Ray. Chester.

177
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:27.710
Ah. so you're the new team tech genius.

178
00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:29.129
Nice to meet you. Chester.

179
00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:30.338
Likewise.

180
00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:33.216
I've been a big fan of yours ever since
reading your papers on quantum qubits.

181
00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:35.552
So you're pretty stoked
about the con this year. huh?

182
00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.053
Oh. are you kidding me?

183
00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:39.764
Ever since I found out you were
going to be this year's Legacy Honoree.

184
00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:44.144
I kind of took the liberty of signing up
to be a CCTC volunteer.

185
00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:49.649
I'm going to be your liaison
for the entire event. if that's cool.

186
00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:51.568
Like. if you're all right.

187
00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:52.819
Sounds great.

188
00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:56.114
Cool. because I already have your whole
itinerary planned to sweet perfection.

189
00:10:58.241 --> 00:11:00.618
So. um. I'm late for work.

190
00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:03.788
So. Ray. Chester. I'll pop by
the convention center later.

191
00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:05.290
-Don't you dare--
-See ya. I gotta go.

192
00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:09.460
Aw. he forgot his breakfast.

193
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.340
That's a bracelet. You know what?
I have to go. too... deadlines.

194
00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:17.051
You got the list of questions
for the interview later. right?

195
00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:18.803
Sure do. See you at 4:00.

196
00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:25.894
Heard some paroled ex-cons
went shopping without their wallets.

197
00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:27.937
OG meta-criminals. actually.

198
00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:33.401
Jack. Ten. King and the Queen. they
call themselves the Royal Flush Gang.

199
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.196
They were Central City's
very first meta-threat.

200
00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:37.405
You worked that case. too?

201
00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:41.159
Actually. no. The first time
they pulled a job. I was...

202
00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.665
...kind of under the weather.

203
00:11:48.499 --> 00:11:53.254
It's weird. Their MO is stealing cash
from casinos. not microchips.

204
00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:58.009
Well. at least no one was Killed...
this time.

205
00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:00.637
Everything okay. Captain?

206
00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:07.185
This is the kind of case the meta
task force would have been assigned to.

207
00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:12.148
Uh. so your mimic powers.

208
00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:14.859
how exactly do they work?

209
00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:17.278
They only activate in times of stress.

210
00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:20.657
when my adrenaline spikes.
and the effects are temporary.

211
00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:22.325
That's good.

212
00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:24.202
Yeah.

213
00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:29.165
Allen. does me being a meta
make working for me more difficult?

214
00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:33.753
No. ma'am. It's already
tough enough as it is.

215
00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:39.092
I'll let you know
as soon as I find something.

216
00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:40.802
Okay.

217
00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:49.686
So I've gone over everyone's ideas
and they're great.

218
00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:52.939
But what I'd like to do is start with
last night's break-in at Mercury Labs.

219
00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:58.278
It's not news. not in this city.

220
00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:01.364
It's a high-tech theft
at a huge R&D corporation--

221
00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:03.533
Which happens all the time in this town.

222
00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.326
-Was anyone killed?
-No.

223
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.786
-Was the Flash involved?
-No. He isn't.

224
00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:10.748
-Tragedy sells papers. folks. Sorry.
-But-- That's not the point.

225
00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:13.334
We should look into the rumors of
embezzlement inside the mayor's office.

226
00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:15.420
Scooping a major scandal
before our competition...

227
00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:16.838
Will make Iris happy.

228
00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:18.464
Get in touch with someone
at the mayor's office.

229
00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:21.175
I got 1.000 words to finish on
the Shark's new GM for Iris. too--

230
00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:23.177
Wait. What 1.000 words?

231
00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:24.762
Well. I know the mayor's
executive assistant.

232
00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:27.265
I need someone on this Mercury break-in.

233
00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:31.394
Vanya. I really need you
to run with this tech heist.

234
00:13:32.603 --> 00:13:35.189
I'm going to follow up
on the Calvert collision this morning.

235
00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:36.858
My source in the county planner's office

236
00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:39.902
says it's going to cost several million
to repair the damage.

237
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:44.282
Talk about a budget crisis.
Plus. that is what Iris would want.

238
00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:50.413
Well. hold on. Wait. guys... seriously?

239
00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:56.127
We found this
at the train collision site.

240
00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:59.464
I thought Kramer had you working
on the Mercury heist instead.

241
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:00.506
Yeah. I am.

242
00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:01.549
You are.

243
00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:05.803
but you think that it's related
to the Calvert train collision?

244
00:14:05.887 --> 00:14:07.388
I will know in a minute.

245
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.224
While working evidence
from the Mercury Labs heist.

246
00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:12.852
I found charred marks
on the guards' weapons.

247
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:15.188
Marks exactly like those.

248
00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:17.648
Yeah. I was right.

249
00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:21.402
Heat signature is the same as the burn
marks on the weapons at Mercury Labs.

250
00:14:21.944 --> 00:14:24.781
Laser burns delivered
with pinpoint precision.

251
00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:26.366
Jack's trademark.

252
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:27.950
Okay. Okay.

253
00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:33.039
Even if it is the Royal Flush Gang
behind all of this. why?

254
00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:35.124
Why would they go through
all the trouble

255
00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:38.211
of causing a massive railway collision

256
00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:40.505
when they haven't even
stolen anything yet?

257
00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:42.006
I asked myself that. too.

258
00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:45.051
Then I found out
what was being carried in this case.

259
00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:51.307
A bleeding-edge. beryllium core.
which is a highly unstable power source.

260
00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:52.892
And that's what caused
the trains to explode.

261
00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:55.478
No. beryllium-based detonation
would have leveled

262
00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:57.146
a surrounding ten-mile radius.

263
00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:02.068
The core wasn't in the case
when the trains collided.

264
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:06.114
Which means the real question
is why is the Royal Flush Gang

265
00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:07.990
changing their MO
to become tech thieves?

266
00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:14.622
Korber. what's going on?

267
00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:16.916
Iron Heights just lost power
for three seconds.

268
00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:19.502
during which every cell door
unlocked and opened.

269
00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:21.921
Now they've got a thousand inmates
roaming the facility.

270
00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:23.673
Barry. if they get out...

271
00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:24.715
Yeah. I know.

272
00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:30.555
Barry. what happened?

273
00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:37.645
I got the inmates back in their cells
before anyone got hurt.

274
00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:40.440
But we've got a bigger problem.

275
00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:44.318
Looks like the Royal Flush Gang
just leveled up. too.

276
00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:52.702
Well. I am impressed.

277
00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:56.372
A schedule timed to the minute.
including a coffee stop to recharge.

278
00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.293
Best. Handler. Ever.

279
00:16:00.376 --> 00:16:02.753
Oh. you're getting a whole lot more
than java at Jitters. my friend.

280
00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:05.548
How about a dozen CCTC

281
00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:09.760
entrepreneurial hopefuls. each with
their own game-changing startup idea.

282
00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:12.388
ready to pitch in three minutes or less

283
00:16:12.763 --> 00:16:17.518
to Ray Palmer. business behemoth.
scientific genius.

284
00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:20.146
Am I right?

285
00:16:20.229 --> 00:16:21.063
Okay. okay.

286
00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:23.816
Come on. Let's go
make some dreams come true.

287
00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:29.697
-Chester.
-Yeah.

288
00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:30.907
What made you think that--

289
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:34.410
Oh. I just know how much
you used start-up investments

290
00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:35.495
to expand Palmer Tech.

291
00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.747
You just got. like. a nose for science.

292
00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:40.041
But I also know you've been out
of the game for a little while.

293
00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:42.251
so I figured I'd help
jumpstart the magic.

294
00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:44.545
-Okay.
-And don't worry about Tech Con.

295
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:47.340
because your interview with Iris
isn't for another 90 minutes.

296
00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:48.966
So we got time.

297
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.218
Hey. I got your back. man.

298
00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:52.470
Thank you.
But I'm not worried about my schedule.

299
00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:56.224
Oh. right. right.
You need a cronut first. obviously.

300
00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:58.226
-Excuse me. can we--
-Chester.

301
00:16:58.559 --> 00:16:59.477
Chester...

302
00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:02.897
I don't want to start
another tech business.

303
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:10.446
It's like I told Barry and Iris.
the only thing I want

304
00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.491
to pursue these days is a balanced life.

305
00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:17.453
That's why I haven't worn
the Atom suit in ages.

306
00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:19.914
Uh-huh. But you're...

307
00:17:19.997 --> 00:17:21.457
You're a Legend.

308
00:17:22.583 --> 00:17:24.418
Was a Legend.

309
00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:28.506
Now I suppose that's what Team Flash
is for.

310
00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:33.511
Look. I know how
that might sound for the Atom.

311
00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:39.183
but Ray Palmer's priorities are his wife
and working in his own lab.

312
00:17:39.976 --> 00:17:41.686
I hope that you can understand that.

313
00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:43.813
Yeah. No. no. I get it.

314
00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:48.818
And. I am. uh... I am so sorry.

315
00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:51.070
-It's okay. It's okay--
-Everyone.

316
00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:58.035
Today's pitch sessions
are officially canceled.

317
00:17:58.119 --> 00:17:59.620
-What?
-No. that's not fair.

318
00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:03.165
Guy. guys. guys.
we are impinging on a great man's time.

319
00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:07.003
So get-- Go on. go on. Come on.

320
00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:08.462
Sorry. everyone.

321
00:18:09.672 --> 00:18:10.756
I still believe in you.

322
00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:13.092
I like your sweater.

323
00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:18.681
And I will. um. leave you

324
00:18:18.806 --> 00:18:22.602
to get your privacy on.
and again l am...

325
00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:25.062
I'm so sorry.

326
00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:26.814
Chester. I--

327
00:18:38.367 --> 00:18:39.577
Thank you so much for coming.

328
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.829
It's so exciting to have you here.

329
00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:46.000
When I founded this conference
five years ago. I never would have

330
00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:47.918
dreamed we'd get coverage like this.

331
00:18:48.002 --> 00:18:50.254
-Well. this is pretty impressive.
-Yeah.

332
00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:53.633
Hey. your press pass
gets you into our after parties.

333
00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:56.218
Are you a fan of filk music.
by any chance?

334
00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:58.220
Boss. Excuse me.

335
00:18:58.554 --> 00:18:59.388
Can we talk?

336
00:18:59.847 --> 00:19:00.848
We'll gab later.

337
00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:05.978
-Hey.
-So I totally blew it at the office.

338
00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:07.521
I told you I wasn't ready.

339
00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:09.690
You got resistance from the staff.

340
00:19:10.191 --> 00:19:11.817
They barely listened to me.

341
00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:15.196
I'm pretty sure they think I don't have
enough experience. which I don't.

342
00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:18.366
And they think that my suggestions
for which stories to cover are wrong.

343
00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:20.284
Yeah. I figured that might happen.

344
00:19:20.868 --> 00:19:22.078
Then why put me in charge?

345
00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:23.579
Because you can handle it.

346
00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:27.500
And dealing with this is a part
of growing into your new position.

347
00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:29.085
Well. I am not growing.

348
00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:31.170
I'm crashing and burning.

349
00:19:31.462 --> 00:19:33.297
Iris. I can't do this.

350
00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:34.548
Yes. you can.

351
00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:37.009
How do you know?

352
00:19:37.343 --> 00:19:40.137
Because you're exactly what
CCC Media needs.

353
00:19:40.721 --> 00:19:42.973
You have a point of view
that's entirely your own.

354
00:19:43.057 --> 00:19:45.935
And you know the city better than anyone
in that room. you grew up here.

355
00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:49.397
You not only survived Iron Heights.
you came out on the other side a hero.

356
00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:51.315
I could melt Taylor's face.

357
00:19:51.565 --> 00:19:54.276
You went from juvenile delinquent
to voice of the people.

358
00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:56.904
And I'm talking about your writing.
not your meta-powers.

359
00:19:57.488 --> 00:19:59.657
Your articles speak to people
because you're one of them.

360
00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:02.118
That's your point of view.

361
00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:05.079
It's also how CCC Media
speaks to the city

362
00:20:05.162 --> 00:20:07.832
and why people respond so strongly.

363
00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:13.713
Okay. but being a journalist
and being in charge are way different.

364
00:20:13.921 --> 00:20:17.091
Look. I know that it's scary.
but think how you leveled up as a meta.

365
00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:18.217
I'm sure that was scary. too.

366
00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:27.351
Try terrifying. but somehow I knew
I could handle an upgrade.

367
00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:29.228
Okay. then do that at the office. too.

368
00:20:29.353 --> 00:20:32.481
Your point of view
is perfect for this company.

369
00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:35.359
You've already learned how to own it.
Now go sell it.

370
00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:36.444
Go.

371
00:20:39.947 --> 00:20:40.781
Sell it.

372
00:20:41.949 --> 00:20:43.242
Turns out the Royal Flush Gang

373
00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:45.202
kidnapped a prisoner named
Jared Haywood.

374
00:20:45.828 --> 00:20:47.580
Had any luck tracking them down?

375
00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:48.748
Not yet.

376
00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:51.333
What about the Mercury Labs chip?

377
00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:54.462
Chester's still trying to figure out
why the Royal Flush Gang would need it.

378
00:20:54.545 --> 00:20:56.672
- Okay.
- Not anymore.

379
00:20:56.881 --> 00:20:58.716
Turns out that chip is so cutting edge.

380
00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:01.469
it has. like. a thousand
different applications.

381
00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:03.637
so. sorry. I blew it.

382
00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:05.723
It just seems to be my thing today.

383
00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:07.308
Hey.

384
00:21:08.017 --> 00:21:10.853
What's going on. Chester?
I'm sensing a whole lot of sadness.

385
00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:12.605
Yeah. Aren't you supposed
to still be with Ray?

386
00:21:13.022 --> 00:21:17.610
I have resigned as Ray's liaison.
Turns out. I messed that up. too.

387
00:21:18.527 --> 00:21:19.820
I'm like. dead to him.

388
00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:26.911
Oh. my God. Cecile. I am so sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

389
00:21:27.077 --> 00:21:29.663
No. no. it's okay. Hey.

390
00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:32.541
you gotta go easy on yourself.

391
00:21:32.875 --> 00:21:33.876
How?

392
00:21:35.085 --> 00:21:37.379
The day I'm having. I feel like
I might as well just

393
00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:40.633
gamble my per diem away
at the craps table with Grandma Runk.

394
00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:42.968
And Tech Con's paying
in cryptocurrency this year.

395
00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:45.471
which barely feels like real money.
even though it totally is.

396
00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:51.060
What if the Royal Flush Gang
didn't change their MO?

397
00:21:52.186 --> 00:21:54.814
Chester. can we find out
if any Star City casinos

398
00:21:54.897 --> 00:21:56.440
also take cryptocurrency?

399
00:21:57.566 --> 00:21:58.400
Yeah.

400
00:22:01.195 --> 00:22:03.239
Hot damn! Turns out they all do.

401
00:22:03.364 --> 00:22:05.574
Guess they'll happily take your money
however they can.

402
00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:07.201
And check this out.

403
00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:12.748
These casinos have over 50 mil
in their digital coffers.

404
00:22:13.123 --> 00:22:15.167
So what exactly would
the Royal Flush Gang need

405
00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:16.877
to pull off a heist like this?

406
00:22:17.586 --> 00:22:19.380
A computer with a next-level microchip.

407
00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:23.384
massive power source to run it...

408
00:22:26.053 --> 00:22:29.348
and an expert in cyber-espionage
to execute the hack.

409
00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:33.435
They didn't change their MO.

410
00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:36.188
They just leveled up.

411
00:22:38.858 --> 00:22:40.109
Okay. how do we stop them?

412
00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:43.070
The second the hack starts.
I can trace it and ping the location.

413
00:22:43.237 --> 00:22:44.363
And I'll be ready.

414
00:22:50.369 --> 00:22:52.496
So. it's all done?

415
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:55.457
Transfer completed.
Who wants to be a millionaire?

416
00:22:55.916 --> 00:22:56.750
I do.

417
00:22:57.501 --> 00:22:58.669
Exactly.

418
00:22:58.836 --> 00:23:01.839
And since more people means
smaller shares for us.

419
00:23:03.424 --> 00:23:04.550
Someone's out of chips.

420
00:23:06.343 --> 00:23:09.305
What the hell. man?
We've planned this for years

421
00:23:09.513 --> 00:23:10.681
and now you're gonna Kill me?

422
00:23:10.973 --> 00:23:12.808
Of course not.

423
00:23:14.184 --> 00:23:15.269
Jack is.

424
00:23:15.728 --> 00:23:16.645
I'm all in.

425
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:21.108
It's over. people.

426
00:23:21.358 --> 00:23:22.985
Haywood's back in Iron Heights.

427
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.153
Who wants to go next?

428
00:23:24.653 --> 00:23:27.531
Oh. usually I know when to fold 'em.

429
00:23:27.823 --> 00:23:31.911
You know. 50 million. it's a lot
to leave on the virtual table.

430
00:23:32.494 --> 00:23:34.955
And since my Queen is a psychic.
who knows everything

431
00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:36.874
you're going to do before you do it.

432
00:23:36.999 --> 00:23:40.377
go ahead. Flash. We call.

433
00:23:41.503 --> 00:23:43.756
Four to one. I like these odds.

434
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:45.841
Go ahead. Flashy.

435
00:23:46.508 --> 00:23:48.594
Pick a card. Any card.

436
00:23:50.512 --> 00:23:53.599
Execute a full house maneuver.
all of you. Now.

437
00:23:53.623 --> 00:23:55.623
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

438
00:24:25.673 --> 00:24:26.590
Hey. bud.

439
00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:32.388
What? This is impossible.

440
00:24:32.846 --> 00:24:35.349
I read your mind.
I saw what you were planning

441
00:24:35.432 --> 00:24:37.935
and then I trumped your hand
by going all in. How did you--

442
00:24:38.018 --> 00:24:39.103
You can read minds?

443
00:24:40.062 --> 00:24:41.230
I can think at super speed.

444
00:24:41.689 --> 00:24:44.942
Your thoughts. after I read them.
you reshuffled the deck!

445
00:24:45.025 --> 00:24:46.944
I guess the house doesn't always win.

446
00:24:53.993 --> 00:24:55.869
I am so sorry. folks.

447
00:24:55.953 --> 00:24:58.122
I know today did not go as planned.

448
00:24:58.205 --> 00:25:00.833
But the rocky road of science
will not stop me

449
00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:04.586
from bringing you
the best Tech Con coverage ever.

450
00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:06.296
Hey Chester. you left before
I could thank you for help--

451
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:10.342
Yo. yo. yo it's my fellow science geek.
CSI Barry Allen!

452
00:25:10.426 --> 00:25:12.678
-Hi.
-Good to see you. man. Good to see you.

453
00:25:12.761 --> 00:25:14.930
-So. ixnay on the ashFlay talk...
-Yeah.

454
00:25:15.973 --> 00:25:17.391
Thanks for coming
to my livestream. dude.

455
00:25:17.474 --> 00:25:20.269
-Sure.
-And this is his first Tech Con ever.

456
00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:22.229
-Somehow that's true.
-Yeah. Yeah. so...

457
00:25:22.312 --> 00:25:23.397
-Barr.
-Yeah.

458
00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.607
How awesome is all this?

459
00:25:25.691 --> 00:25:28.193
It's pretty awesome. Have you seen
the Magnus Labs' Saturn simulation?

460
00:25:28.277 --> 00:25:29.903
Dude. I was in it.

461
00:25:29.987 --> 00:25:31.196
You can get in it?

462
00:25:32.364 --> 00:25:34.825
Hey. Ray! There's Legacy Honoree.
Ray Palmer.

463
00:25:35.242 --> 00:25:37.286
Come say hi.
You've seen some of these displays?

464
00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:39.913
Yeah. I mean. the imagination
on display is just stellar.

465
00:25:40.164 --> 00:25:42.833
-Hey. Chester--
-Welcome to my livestream. Mr. Palmer.

466
00:25:43.459 --> 00:25:46.170
But hey. it's been a great
first day of webcasting.

467
00:25:46.336 --> 00:25:47.963
So. how about we take a break?

468
00:25:48.297 --> 00:25:51.300
-Good. 'cause then we can talk about...
-See you in ten. party people.

469
00:25:51.842 --> 00:25:53.093
-Hold this please.
-Okay.

470
00:25:53.427 --> 00:25:54.887
...talk about what happened earlier.

471
00:25:57.598 --> 00:25:59.349
Well. he's not avoiding me.

472
00:26:01.018 --> 00:26:03.353
Chester surprised me earlier
with a pitch fest

473
00:26:03.437 --> 00:26:06.273
to mentor aspiring scientists and...

474
00:26:06.732 --> 00:26:09.193
the intention of forming a startup
with one of them.

475
00:26:09.943 --> 00:26:10.903
That sounds great.

476
00:26:11.612 --> 00:26:13.363
And it would have been before. but...

477
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.825
I've grown a lot the last few months.

478
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:18.827
So. what? You don't miss any of this?

479
00:26:19.661 --> 00:26:21.789
-I'm still a scientist. Barry.
-Yeah.

480
00:26:21.872 --> 00:26:24.083
But. you know. if I start another
big tech company.

481
00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:28.003
next thing I know...
I get lost in all this again.

482
00:26:28.879 --> 00:26:30.422
This is all so intoxicating

483
00:26:31.298 --> 00:26:33.842
and... I don't want
to fall back into the trap.

484
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.719
I get that. but...

485
00:26:36.553 --> 00:26:40.140
I'm not the same that I was.
the first time I put on the cowl either.

486
00:26:40.307 --> 00:26:43.477
I'm faster. more confident.
more at ease with myself.

487
00:26:44.019 --> 00:26:45.687
Yeah. You've grown. too.

488
00:26:45.896 --> 00:26:48.107
Yeah. One of the ways that's happened

489
00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:50.818
is learning to take time out
to help Team Flash grow. too.

490
00:26:51.693 --> 00:26:54.113
I've learned just as much from them
as they've learned from me.

491
00:26:54.196 --> 00:26:56.406
It's like being a CSI.
Every day I work with

492
00:26:56.824 --> 00:26:58.700
all my fellow officers
in all departments.

493
00:27:01.912 --> 00:27:05.749
I mean... I do miss
scientific collaboration.

494
00:27:07.042 --> 00:27:09.962
It's like I told Chester.
I'm not a Legend anymore.

495
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.756
And I don't have the C.C.P.D.

496
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:14.466
So what?

497
00:27:15.217 --> 00:27:17.845
You're Ray Palmer. Legacy Honoree.

498
00:27:18.595 --> 00:27:21.557
If you want something
that doesn't exist. invent it.

499
00:27:39.616 --> 00:27:42.411
This copy is damn well-written.

500
00:27:43.287 --> 00:27:45.998
What exactly are you looking for?

501
00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:47.416
If you even know.

502
00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.586
Look. these stories aren't bad.

503
00:27:51.128 --> 00:27:53.130
They're well sourced. Thorough.

504
00:27:53.213 --> 00:27:57.885
But. CCC Media is about more
than just providing facts.

505
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.512
It's the voice of the people.

506
00:28:00.846 --> 00:28:03.682
which means
it needs to have something to say.

507
00:28:03.891 --> 00:28:06.226
It's literally the opposite
of objective journalism.

508
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.687
How about we leave
the editorializing to Iris?

509
00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:13.483
Okay. it's right there in the name.
Central City Citizen.

510
00:28:14.985 --> 00:28:17.821
Yeah. you guys landed
some pretty major interviews.

511
00:28:18.113 --> 00:28:21.742
but every person's voice
in this city deserves to be heard.

512
00:28:21.825 --> 00:28:24.244
Not just the most famous
or high-profile ones.

513
00:28:24.328 --> 00:28:27.789
So what. we're not even supposed to talk
to the DA or the mayor anymore?

514
00:28:27.915 --> 00:28:29.124
Yes. talk to them.

515
00:28:29.583 --> 00:28:32.669
But then go talk to the janitor
who cleans the mayor's office

516
00:28:33.253 --> 00:28:37.007
or a mom working two jobs
just to pay her bills.

517
00:28:37.216 --> 00:28:41.178
Because corruption in this city.
it affects them more than anyone.

518
00:28:42.971 --> 00:28:45.849
Don't you guys see?
When we're at our best.

519
00:28:46.183 --> 00:28:49.770
our readers see themselves
reflected in our stories.

520
00:28:52.689 --> 00:28:54.358
So. try again.

521
00:28:55.484 --> 00:28:58.987
But this time...
remember who you're writing for.

522
00:29:10.082 --> 00:29:11.541
You've already
accomplished so much...

523
00:29:12.376 --> 00:29:14.628
...and now you're a CCTC Legacy Honoree.

524
00:29:16.046 --> 00:29:18.131
What's next for you? Retirement?

525
00:29:19.049 --> 00:29:20.717
Uh...

526
00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.304
Well. honestly I...

527
00:29:27.474 --> 00:29:28.475
I'm not sure.

528
00:29:30.227 --> 00:29:32.104
That question's come up
for me a lot today.

529
00:29:32.521 --> 00:29:35.148
And. you know. I have been doing
a ton of research lately.

530
00:29:35.232 --> 00:29:39.069
but. I also don't want to repeat
my previous achievements.

531
00:29:39.403 --> 00:29:42.656
So. I guess I'm having
conflicting thoughts about it.

532
00:29:43.407 --> 00:29:44.700
It's a tough decision.

533
00:29:47.035 --> 00:29:48.078
So. you know what?

534
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.039
Maybe we should all find out together...

535
00:29:52.165 --> 00:29:53.000
next year.

536
00:29:58.839 --> 00:30:00.465
Okay. and on that note.

537
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:02.467
let's thank Ray Palmer
for joining us today.

538
00:30:12.185 --> 00:30:13.353
You all should run.

539
00:30:18.775 --> 00:30:20.402
While you still can.

540
00:30:22.529 --> 00:30:23.447
Everybody go.

541
00:30:24.156 --> 00:30:25.032
Go!

542
00:30:29.619 --> 00:30:30.579
Flash.

543
00:30:31.163 --> 00:30:32.581
don't make this difficult.

544
00:30:34.166 --> 00:30:35.334
Show yourself.

545
00:30:38.587 --> 00:30:39.963
I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone.

546
00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:42.674
Why don't you just tell me
what it is you want?

547
00:30:43.175 --> 00:30:44.176
Of course.

548
00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.512
I came a long way to find you. Flash.

549
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:49.681
And now that I have.

550
00:30:52.267 --> 00:30:53.477
I'm going to Kill you.

551
00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:03.612
Whoever you are.
if you're looking for a fight.

552
00:31:04.363 --> 00:31:05.197
you found one.

553
00:31:08.742 --> 00:31:09.785
Oh. snap!

554
00:31:10.077 --> 00:31:11.703
Time for Flash to do what he does best

555
00:31:12.079 --> 00:31:12.996
and kick some butt.

556
00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:15.457
You're nothing like I expected.

557
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:17.918
Not that it matters.

558
00:31:18.627 --> 00:31:20.253
Those who were once good

559
00:31:21.797 --> 00:31:23.173
die just as easily.

560
00:31:37.104 --> 00:31:39.189
-Oh. well. that's not good.
-What is that thing?

561
00:31:39.481 --> 00:31:41.858
Oh. I'm picking up some
seriously advanced tech readings.

562
00:31:42.025 --> 00:31:43.485
You just have that thing
in your back pocket?

563
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:45.320
No. I just picked it up
from right there.

564
00:31:46.488 --> 00:31:48.073
Oh. yeah. Tech Con. right.

565
00:31:48.156 --> 00:31:49.449
I think Barry's gonna need
a helping hand.

566
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:53.537
Wait. What?
Like a superhero team up with the Atom?

567
00:31:55.163 --> 00:31:56.039
What changed your mind?

568
00:31:59.292 --> 00:32:01.336
My friends. An old one and a new one.

569
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.130
But I'm still not a Legend.

570
00:32:04.714 --> 00:32:06.091
Man. you're a hell of a lot more.

571
00:32:28.321 --> 00:32:30.407
I was born amongst the stars. Flash.

572
00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:32.617
Trapping me in a vacuum was pointless.

573
00:32:33.285 --> 00:32:36.830
Now surrender...
and I promise you won't suffer.

574
00:32:40.584 --> 00:32:41.793
And the suit still fits.

575
00:32:42.627 --> 00:32:45.422
-Hey! You been working out?
-Yeah. thank you for noticing.

576
00:32:47.632 --> 00:32:48.967
-All right. you ready?
-Yeah.

577
00:32:53.722 --> 00:32:55.849
Flash! Atom! Who are you firing at?

578
00:32:56.099 --> 00:32:57.517
Yeah. yeah. He's right behind you.

579
00:33:09.488 --> 00:33:11.031
Oh. now I know how Diggle feels.

580
00:33:11.781 --> 00:33:14.451
This guy isn't just strong.
I think he's messing with our minds.

581
00:33:14.951 --> 00:33:15.869
Correct.

582
00:33:16.119 --> 00:33:19.581
This isn't your fight. Atom.
Now leave while you still can.

583
00:33:19.664 --> 00:33:20.707
Everyone has a weakness.

584
00:33:22.042 --> 00:33:23.251
I'll keep him occupied.

585
00:33:42.437 --> 00:33:45.607
You can't fool me
with a speed mirage. Flash.

586
00:33:46.191 --> 00:33:48.109
My mind is too powerful.

587
00:33:48.235 --> 00:33:50.153
Wait. you said I was good once.

588
00:33:51.571 --> 00:33:54.032
What happened to me? You owe me that.

589
00:33:55.283 --> 00:33:56.409
As you wish.

590
00:34:01.873 --> 00:34:04.751
Bear witness to a coming Armageddon

591
00:34:04.918 --> 00:34:07.045
that you create ten years from now.

592
00:34:08.088 --> 00:34:10.590
One that destroys your own planet.

593
00:34:12.592 --> 00:34:14.177
It's already happened. Flash.

594
00:34:14.261 --> 00:34:16.680
That's why I. Despero. have to kill you.

595
00:34:18.306 --> 00:34:20.141
It's how I save our world.

596
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.323
No!

597
00:34:37.284 --> 00:34:39.244
-Man. whatever you did--
-Any time. Flash.

598
00:34:39.536 --> 00:34:40.620
-Hey!
-Hey. you guys okay?

599
00:34:41.037 --> 00:34:41.871
Yeah.

600
00:34:42.122 --> 00:34:43.206
Where'd that thing go?

601
00:34:43.873 --> 00:34:45.208
I don't know.

602
00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.928
Barry. you know you're not destined
to destroy the world. right?

603
00:34:57.012 --> 00:35:00.515
Yeah. I know. But the visions Despero
showed me seemed so real.

604
00:35:00.974 --> 00:35:02.309
And he said "our world."

605
00:35:02.601 --> 00:35:04.019
But what does that even mean?

606
00:35:04.102 --> 00:35:05.770
I don't know... yet.

607
00:35:06.104 --> 00:35:07.355
What if he's mind-punking you?

608
00:35:07.731 --> 00:35:10.567
Like how he made you and Ray
see an illusion during your fight?

609
00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:12.902
I don't think he was.

610
00:35:13.445 --> 00:35:15.071
Every test I've run on Barry shows that

611
00:35:15.155 --> 00:35:17.407
he's completely fine.
mentally and physically.

612
00:35:17.574 --> 00:35:20.285
Well. I scanned the residual feelings
that Despero left behind

613
00:35:20.368 --> 00:35:23.538
inside your mind.
and there was no doubt.

614
00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.875
Despero was telling the truth.
He really did see those things.

615
00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:28.627
Which means everyone's in danger.

616
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.838
No. no. There's no way that you're
the bad guy in this situation.

617
00:35:31.921 --> 00:35:34.424
What we need to do right now
is find out the truth.

618
00:35:34.507 --> 00:35:36.551
I have a bad feeling it's gonna find us.

619
00:35:36.635 --> 00:35:39.429
Once Despero gets back
from wherever Ray sent him.

620
00:35:39.512 --> 00:35:43.475
Yeah. Well. the tech inside
his belt was so complex.

621
00:35:43.808 --> 00:35:45.852
I could barely recognize
the navigation system.

622
00:35:45.935 --> 00:35:49.397
So. instead of sending him to a specific
location. I tried a random setting.

623
00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:51.232
Who knows where he went.

624
00:35:51.566 --> 00:35:53.318
-Or when he's coming back.
-Barr...

625
00:35:53.777 --> 00:35:56.446
how do we beat
a ten-foot-tall red alien.

626
00:35:56.529 --> 00:35:59.324
who thinks like Grodd
and punches like Fuerza?

627
00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:02.160
By figuring out
what kind of alien he is.

628
00:36:02.452 --> 00:36:05.372
Get that and you may have some idea
of what his weaknesses are.

629
00:36:05.497 --> 00:36:07.666
-Like Kryptonians.
-And Kryptonite.

630
00:36:08.249 --> 00:36:10.043
Great idea. I'll call Alex
in National City.

631
00:36:10.126 --> 00:36:11.252
Yeah. So what do we do?

632
00:36:11.503 --> 00:36:13.755
Well. he took our best shots
like they were nothing.

633
00:36:13.838 --> 00:36:15.840
-We need to be ready.
-For what?

634
00:36:16.966 --> 00:36:17.967
The fight of our lives.

635
00:36:23.056 --> 00:36:23.890
Iris.

636
00:36:24.516 --> 00:36:27.143
This account of Despero
fighting Flash and Atom.

637
00:36:27.644 --> 00:36:28.603
it's amazing.

638
00:36:29.062 --> 00:36:29.979
Is Barry okay?

639
00:36:30.563 --> 00:36:34.567
Yeah. it's just Despero is like
no one we've ever faced before.

640
00:36:35.694 --> 00:36:36.569
Any notes?

641
00:36:37.028 --> 00:36:38.738
Just one. Publish this.

642
00:36:39.155 --> 00:36:41.199
Now. People need to read it.

643
00:36:41.741 --> 00:36:44.619
You saw everything and survived.
The city needs to know it can. too.

644
00:36:45.954 --> 00:36:48.331
By the way. I read the revised articles

645
00:36:48.415 --> 00:36:50.417
that you had Vanya. Aariz
and Taylor write.

646
00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:51.876
And?

647
00:36:52.419 --> 00:36:54.295
We're going straight to print
with all of them.

648
00:36:55.964 --> 00:36:57.841
Whatever you did to inspire
quality work like this.

649
00:36:57.924 --> 00:36:59.342
it must have gotten through.

650
00:36:59.718 --> 00:37:00.593
Thank God.

651
00:37:01.511 --> 00:37:04.180
But they're still not happy with me.

652
00:37:04.556 --> 00:37:06.224
Mm. Welcome to management.

653
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:12.939
Are you sure you don't
need me to stick around?

654
00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:15.358
Nora can handle any
supernatural emergencies while I'm gone.

655
00:37:15.442 --> 00:37:17.610
and like you said. Despero
could come back any minute.

656
00:37:17.736 --> 00:37:20.905
It's okay. We're on it.
and if Despero comes back again--

657
00:37:21.114 --> 00:37:23.199
The Atom will embiggen. yeah?

658
00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:25.869
No? All right. Keep working on that one.

659
00:37:27.245 --> 00:37:29.456
Chester. what you did
back there at Jitters--

660
00:37:29.539 --> 00:37:32.375
-Was a huge mistake. I know--
-Was the best gift possible.

661
00:37:33.209 --> 00:37:35.253
Between that and helping Barry
again as the Atom.

662
00:37:35.336 --> 00:37:37.547
I have now realized
that there's a middle ground

663
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:41.134
to this whole balance thing.
Which is why I want to return the favor.

664
00:37:41.342 --> 00:37:44.345
So. what if I created
a non-profit organization

665
00:37:44.429 --> 00:37:46.931
to fund young scientists
like your Jitters friends?

666
00:37:49.058 --> 00:37:50.810
-That would be awesome.
-Great!

667
00:37:50.977 --> 00:37:53.563
I was thinking I could call it
the Quincy P. Runk Foundation.

668
00:37:53.855 --> 00:37:56.065
if that's okay?
Barry told me about your father.

669
00:38:01.237 --> 00:38:02.071
Oh!

670
00:38:06.034 --> 00:38:09.829
Uh... Yeah. If you ever need. like.
a consultant or anything like that.

671
00:38:09.913 --> 00:38:10.747
I know who to call.

672
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:15.251
Oh. and. Barry...

673
00:38:16.586 --> 00:38:19.506
There's one sure way to prove to Despero
that you'd never destroy the world.

674
00:38:19.756 --> 00:38:20.673
What's that?

675
00:38:21.674 --> 00:38:22.926
Just show him who you really are.

676
00:38:23.843 --> 00:38:25.595
Like you do with this team
each and every day.

677
00:38:37.899 --> 00:38:39.943
Barry. we got an alien signal
coming in hot.

678
00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:42.487
Barry. are you sure about this?

679
00:38:43.071 --> 00:38:44.239
Yeah. it's like Ray said.

680
00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.075
the only way to convince Despero
I'm not a threat.

681
00:38:47.158 --> 00:38:48.535
is to show him who I really am.

682
00:38:52.372 --> 00:38:54.332
Prepare to die. Flash.

683
00:38:54.916 --> 00:38:56.459
Every life ends sooner or later.

684
00:38:57.168 --> 00:38:59.045
Wise words from a dead man.

685
00:38:59.295 --> 00:39:00.713
Despero. I'm not going to
fight you again.

686
00:39:00.839 --> 00:39:02.882
Really? I'm disappointed.

687
00:39:03.466 --> 00:39:05.718
Striking down a defenseless foe?

688
00:39:06.553 --> 00:39:08.346
Well. there's no pleasure in that.

689
00:39:08.429 --> 00:39:09.556
So you enjoy killing?

690
00:39:12.684 --> 00:39:15.478
Twist my words at your own risk!

691
00:39:16.646 --> 00:39:17.772
You wanted to kill me.

692
00:39:18.731 --> 00:39:19.858
I'm not running anywhere.

693
00:39:25.989 --> 00:39:26.990
Neither am I.

694
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:31.035
In another time. on another world.

695
00:39:31.744 --> 00:39:33.997
we could've fought side by side.
you and I.

696
00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.292
There's great strength in you. Flash.

697
00:39:37.959 --> 00:39:39.502
But I've seen your future.

698
00:39:41.004 --> 00:39:43.882
The lives you take.
the betrayals you revel in.

699
00:39:44.841 --> 00:39:46.885
You're the most dangerous kind of killer

700
00:39:48.011 --> 00:39:50.138
because you hide in the body of a hero.

701
00:39:50.221 --> 00:39:51.264
I'm not a killer.

702
00:39:53.141 --> 00:39:55.685
I'm not whatever you think I am.
I can prove it.

703
00:39:55.852 --> 00:39:59.272
If you let me show you the truth.
Or are you gonna take an innocent life

704
00:39:59.939 --> 00:40:01.024
just to prove you're right?

705
00:40:01.941 --> 00:40:04.402
You're either very stupid or very brave.

706
00:40:05.945 --> 00:40:07.447
I can't decide which.

707
00:40:07.572 --> 00:40:09.365
Find out. Scan my mind.

708
00:40:10.158 --> 00:40:11.618
See for yourself. then decide.

709
00:40:18.541 --> 00:40:20.501
I see no deception in your mind.

710
00:40:22.754 --> 00:40:27.634
But I do see truth... and honor.

711
00:40:31.012 --> 00:40:34.390
Flash. you're asking me
to risk allowing the future

712
00:40:34.474 --> 00:40:36.267
I've already witnessed. to unfold.

713
00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:39.437
I'm sorry.

714
00:40:41.397 --> 00:40:42.899
There's too many lives at stake.

715
00:40:43.691 --> 00:40:46.319
Don't you see? This is why I came back.

716
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.989
This is the purpose
that I swore to uphold.

717
00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:51.699
What if you're wrong about me?

718
00:40:54.243 --> 00:40:58.039
I've spent my entire life
protecting this world.

719
00:40:59.499 --> 00:41:02.043
All I'm asking for is a chance to prove
I'd never turn my back on it.

720
00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:04.128
Why should I believe you?

721
00:41:09.759 --> 00:41:10.969
Because my name is Barry Allen.

722
00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.388
And I have nothing to hide.

723
00:41:16.015 --> 00:41:18.226
Your boldness impresses me. Flash.

724
00:41:20.269 --> 00:41:22.313
And has earned you a stay of execution.

725
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:27.276
You now have seven Earth days to prove
that you won't become the monster

726
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.195
I've already witnessed in the future.

727
00:41:29.529 --> 00:41:31.990
If you can't convince me in that time

728
00:41:32.115 --> 00:41:35.201
or if I find any trace
of a darker nature.

729
00:41:36.494 --> 00:41:38.329
I will end your existence.

730
00:41:38.353 --> 00:41:46.353
