﻿1
00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.889
Freeze!
Put your hands in the air!

2
00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:41.602
Well. hello. officers.

3
00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:06.960
Now. that was fun.

4
00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:09.838
I'm so not in the mood for this.

5
00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:12.674
All right. big guy.

6
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.843
I'm gonna give you
one chance to stand down.

7
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.679
I'll give you one chance to beat it.

8
00:02:17.763 --> 00:02:19.139
Chester. what's he wearing?

9
00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:21.058
Chester.

10
00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:24.061
Sorry. Just give me a second to. uh...

11
00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.646
Okay. Okay. I got it.

12
00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:29.691
The armor matches the description
of an exo suit stolen from Ivo Labs.

13
00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:32.903
It's charged by amplifying
the wearer's biochemistry.

14
00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.821
So everything from his movements

15
00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:36.365
to even his emotions...

16
00:02:36.448 --> 00:02:38.075
Are fuel that makes him stronger.

17
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.702
You should have run away
when you had the chance. Flash.

18
00:02:40.786 --> 00:02:42.621
Now. this has to happen.

19
00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:50.003
There's a lot of people in there.

20
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.004
Okay. Flash.

21
00:02:51.088 --> 00:02:53.298
He just compromised
two steel girders in that substructure.

22
00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:54.758
That building's gonna collapse.

23
00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:56.593
Allegra. Cecile.
I'm gonna use my lightning

24
00:02:56.677 --> 00:02:58.261
to weld those girders back together.

25
00:02:58.345 --> 00:02:59.346
Take this guy down.

26
00:02:59.513 --> 00:03:01.348
Okay. Let's do a classic
corral and contain.

27
00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:03.517
Allegra. charge up
and hit him with a UV burst.

28
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.311
Hey. snow pants. Over here.

29
00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:07.938
And then. Frost. you swoop in...

30
00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.112
Allegra!

31
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.030
The blast knocked her out.
but she's still breathing.

32
00:03:17.114 --> 00:03:18.615
I am so sorry.

33
00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.283
Chester. I need you to focus.

34
00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.786
You've got to help me figure out
how I'm going to stop this guy.

35
00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.122
Your friend should learn how to aim.

36
00:03:25.247 --> 00:03:27.999
If you can try to calm his emotions.

37
00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:29.209
that could depower the suit.

38
00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:32.796
You trying to mess with my head?

39
00:03:36.842 --> 00:03:37.676
What just happened?

40
00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.344
It's all of my grief from Frost.

41
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:42.472
and all the panic inside the building.

42
00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:46.309
I can't take it.
it's overloading me.

43
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:47.936
I can't use my powers.

44
00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.064
Pathetic. Worst heroes ever.

45
00:03:54.735 --> 00:03:56.611
Allegra. Allegra.

46
00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:58.488
Hey. hey.

47
00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:00.031
You guys okay?

48
00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:01.158
Yeah.

49
00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:03.076
Chester. where'd he go?

50
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.953
I don't know. He just vanished.

51
00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:37.527
The CCC tip line still has nothing
on Mark Desmond. aka Blockbuster.

52
00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:38.987
Keep digging. please.

53
00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:43.700
Chester says his suit has some kind
of cloaking tech we can't track.

54
00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:46.495
which means...
we're not going to see him again.

55
00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:48.038
Until he attacks.

56
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.956
And when he does?

57
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.336
Iris. we can't go
back out there like this.

58
00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:56.880
I mean. we should have
easily stopped Desmond.

59
00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:58.882
but Allegra and Cecile
were almost killed.

60
00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:01.009
We're all still pretty
messed up about Frost.

61
00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:04.679
I think with any normal job.
we would take time off to grieve.

62
00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:07.724
-But with Team Flash...
-This isn't a normal job.

63
00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:13.188
Iris. how am I supposed to tell people
who just lost a family member.

64
00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:16.525
they need to find a way to mourn

65
00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:18.318
and still get the job done?

66
00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:19.569
I don't know.

67
00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:23.782
But if there is anyone
who can find the right words

68
00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:25.659
to inspire us right now. it's you.

69
00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.707
Thanks for taking the time
for this meeting. guys.

70
00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.168
Yeah. We realize it's a crazy time
with everything going on.

71
00:05:35.252 --> 00:05:36.169
Of course.

72
00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.255
Yeah. We need to be together.

73
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.589
Now. more than ever.

74
00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.258
Speaking of. where's Caitlin?

75
00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:42.300
I didn't want to bother her.

76
00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:44.594
I think she's preparing
for the funeral tomorrow.

77
00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.304
Maybe we should do the same thing.

78
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.349
Look. while your satellite
is looking for Desmond.

79
00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:50.684
Kramer put out an APB

80
00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:53.854
and she's got a unit
placed at every bank in town.

81
00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:56.439
And luckily. we have the time
to take a break.

82
00:05:56.565 --> 00:05:59.025
In a perfect world. it would be great
to take some time off.

83
00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:00.026
God knows we all need it.

84
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.696
But at any moment.
we could face something worse.

85
00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:05.448
And. whether we like it or not.
we're this city's first line of defense.

86
00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:07.409
We all saw what happened out there.

87
00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:10.704
Yeah. if it had been
Bloodwork or Despero...

88
00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:12.622
You know. Frost is gone.

89
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.958
And we all need to mourn her.

90
00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:17.294
But we also need to find a way
to protect this city.

91
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.589
I didn't realize
we were having a team meeting.

92
00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:24.801
We figured you might need
some alone time.

93
00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:26.052
It's fine.

94
00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:29.306
I haven't been sleeping very much.
so I could use the distraction.

95
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.766
Are you sure? I know
you must be dealing with a lot.

96
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.644
and I know how hard it can be
to organize a funeral.

97
00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:36.813
Actually. my mom is handling
all the arrangements.

98
00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:39.900
Okay. I mean. if that's what you want.

99
00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:41.443
but we're all happy to pitch in.

100
00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.445
Like I said. my mom's got it covered.

101
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.071
But if you've got a problem with that.

102
00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:46.156
feel free to give her a call.

103
00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:47.490
Offer your help.

104
00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:50.410
‘Cause I'm not going
to any damn funeral.

105
00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:54.331
-Caitlin.
-Barr.

106
00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:56.875
Give her some space.

107
00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.084
Dad. she's hurting.

108
00:06:58.168 --> 00:06:59.669
Baby girl. I know. We all are.

109
00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:03.548
But like Barry said.

110
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:06.760
we just lost a family member.

111
00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:10.847
and that pain will keep us

112
00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:12.849
from protecting those in need.

113
00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:16.519
It will cloud everything we do

114
00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:18.188
until we face it.

115
00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:19.522
and heal.

116
00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:21.483
Yeah. but how are we
supposed to do that?

117
00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:23.944
By honoring Frost.

118
00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:26.029
Look. I just...

119
00:07:27.656 --> 00:07:30.867
took watercolor classes
at the community center

120
00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:32.786
because Frost made me promise

121
00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.789
that I would try to
express myself through art.

122
00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:38.208
And I got to admit.
when I saw the first canvas...

123
00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:45.548
I felt Frost
smiling down on me.

124
00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:49.719
And we all have to find our own ways

125
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.638
to honor her.

126
00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:55.058
'Cause it is the only way.

127
00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:58.353
we are going to heal as a family.

128
00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:19.332
There's still zero hits
on the tip line about Blockbuster.

129
00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:22.919
It's already tough
knowing that people almost died

130
00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:24.838
because we weren't ready to face him.

131
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:27.424
But knowing that he could reappear
at any moment.

132
00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:29.300
it makes what we're going through
that much harder.

133
00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:30.260
I know.

134
00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:32.095
Which reminds me.

135
00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:35.765
I think I've decided how I'm going to
take Joe's advice and honor Frost.

136
00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:38.309
After her court battle last year.

137
00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:40.228
wrongly imprisoned metas?

138
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.690
That became a cause
really close to her heart.

139
00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:45.650
So. effective immediately.

140
00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:48.194
I am going to dedicate
25% of my caseload

141
00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:49.904
to pro bono work in her honor.

142
00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:51.865
Frost would love that.

143
00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:52.866
Yeah?

144
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:57.245
I'm going to write
a special obituary for her on CCC.

145
00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.872
That's a great idea.

146
00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:01.791
Yeah. but every time
I sit down to write it. I can't.

147
00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:04.252
Because...

148
00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:07.172
I mean. to write about her
in any meaningful way.

149
00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:09.883
like how she died
saving her sister. I...

150
00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:12.719
You risk exposing yourself
as a member of Team Flash.

151
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:14.387
Yeah.

152
00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:15.972
But this is my job. so.

153
00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:18.308
why can't I push through?

154
00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:23.313
Hey. Aariz.

155
00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:29.319
When you interviewed last year.
you mentioned writing obits once.

156
00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:30.487
For Stars and Stripes.

157
00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:33.239
When I was on active duty
with the Army in Afghanistan.

158
00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:34.616
sometimes I'd help write obits

159
00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:37.410
for soldiers who died
on classified missions

160
00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:38.578
or had no family.

161
00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:41.956
If I wasn't privy to all the details.

162
00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:44.626
I'd find other ways
to honor their memory.

163
00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:45.835
That's amazing.

164
00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.546
Do you think that you could
take over Frost's obit

165
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.672
for tonight's headline?

166
00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:53.009
I always admired how she handled
those ridiculous charges against her.

167
00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:55.428
I could have it ready in. say. an hour.

168
00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:56.763
Yeah. that would be great.

169
00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:58.098
- Thank you.
- You got it.

170
00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:00.183
Hey. Iris.

171
00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:04.354
Honey. are you sure you want
to hand over something so personal

172
00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.815
to somebody who never even met Frost?

173
00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:10.360
Well. I think an objective point of view
is exactly what I'm missing.

174
00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:15.198
So. does it do her justice?

175
00:10:16.407 --> 00:10:17.700
Well...

176
00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:22.205
You think Aariz did a terrible job?

177
00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:27.335
It's well written
and factually accurate.

178
00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.170
but it feels cold.

179
00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:33.216
Like it was written by someone
who didn't know Frost.

180
00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:36.803
But that's not why I wanted to talk.

181
00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:38.888
I could have read this over email.

182
00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:41.724
I wanted to see how you're doing.

183
00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:48.731
I feel the same way.

184
00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:51.985
Iris.

185
00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:54.487
why didn't you write this?

186
00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:56.739
I mean. you've known Frost
longer than I have.

187
00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:01.786
I guess. at first.
I felt like if I wrote it.

188
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.581
I wouldn't be able to say everything
that I wanted to say.

189
00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:06.708
But the more I think about it.

190
00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:08.209
the more I realize that...

191
00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:11.212
I don't know what to say.

192
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.759
Carla. I may have known Frost longer.
but I didn't...

193
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.720
get to know her.

194
00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:21.890
And now you're angry at yourself
for lost opportunities.

195
00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:24.559
because you thought you had
all the time in the world.

196
00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:29.647
I felt the same way being
estranged from Caitlin for so long.

197
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:33.109
And then I almost made the same mistake
when Frost came around. but...

198
00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.446
Luckily for me. she didn't let me.

199
00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:41.951
And in the end.
I got to know her just a bit...

200
00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:45.580
and I'm... I'm better for it.

201
00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:51.920
So. what do I do now?

202
00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:53.796
Well. here's one thing
I do know.

203
00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:57.592
Frost wouldn't care about some obituary
that sung her praises.

204
00:11:58.426 --> 00:12:00.220
She didn't give a damn
what people thought.

205
00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:04.140
She just wanted to protect them.

206
00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:06.601
That was her legacy.

207
00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:08.645
Yeah.

208
00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:13.566
Thank you. Carla.

209
00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:16.152
Yeah.

210
00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:18.780
- I think I know what to do now.
- Okay.

211
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:22.325
Thanks.

212
00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:23.993
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

213
00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:28.998
Oh. excuse me.
Could I get that iced drink? The Frost.

214
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.334
Sure. but it's actually called
Killer Frost.

215
00:12:34.128 --> 00:12:35.129
Well. it shouldn't be.

216
00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:38.549
Never mind. Thanks.

217
00:12:51.854 --> 00:12:53.815
Welcome to Citizentopia.

218
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.067
where you. the citizens of Central City.

219
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.735
share your stories.

220
00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:01.864
I am here today
to talk about a fallen hero.

221
00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:05.326
Someone who was often misunderstood.

222
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.578
A woman that you all know as...

223
00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:09.622
Killer Frost.

224
00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:12.959
But to the people who really knew her.

225
00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:14.544
she was no killer.

226
00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:19.382
Frost saved lives
and she changed them for the better.

227
00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:22.719
And I am here with two people
who are proof of that.

228
00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:24.554
Kamiko. Jamal. thank you for joining us.

229
00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:25.513
-Hello.
-Hi.

230
00:13:25.596 --> 00:13:26.806
-Sure.
-Thanks for having us.

231
00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:31.519
So. I understand that you both
had a unique encounter with Frost?

232
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.896
It was during Bloodwork's attack
on the city

233
00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:35.648
and. uh. we were in the subway.

234
00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:38.693
It was just completely overrun
by his blood brothers.

235
00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:39.986
I was so scared.

236
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.237
We all were.

237
00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:42.697
It was a bunch of strangers trapped.

238
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.074
while those things
picked us off one by one.

239
00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:47.577
Until Frost showed up.

240
00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:50.955
Seeing her courage in court.

241
00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:53.708
I knew I was on
the wrong side of the bench.

242
00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:57.962
So. when she was released.
I reached out.

243
00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:00.256
asking for forgiveness.

244
00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:03.551
She caught me right in the middle of it.

245
00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:06.095
But she didn't turn me in.

246
00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:07.513
It was amazing.

247
00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:10.183
Frost froze those blood brothers
and helped us escape.

248
00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:12.226
We owe her our lives.

249
00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:14.437
And what did Frost say?

250
00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:16.105
That I did my job.

251
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.233
But maybe I should get a better one.

252
00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.195
Man. I was a tagger.

253
00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:24.280
If it wasn't for Frost.
I'd be in jail right now.

254
00:14:26.824 --> 00:14:28.534
Instead. I got my first
gallery exhibit next week.

255
00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:33.039
So. the next day.
I quit the State Prosecutor's Office.

256
00:14:34.248 --> 00:14:36.584
Now I'm defending metas in Star City.

257
00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:40.338
If it wasn't for Frost. we...
would have never gotten married.

258
00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:47.303
So. wherever you are. Frost.

259
00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:48.971
thank you.

260
00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:18.459
There must be one perfect thing
to do to honor Frost.

261
00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:21.462
Just because Joe handed out
some greeting card advice

262
00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:23.423
doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.

263
00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:27.176
I don't know.
It sounded pretty on point to me.

264
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.680
How can one thing honor someone
as amazing as Frost?

265
00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:34.517
Barry told us about
the eternal flame for Oliver Queen.

266
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.563
What if we made. like.
a Frost-ified version?

267
00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:41.941
Yeah. yeah.
like if I took her superhero costume

268
00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:45.027
and I put itin a glass case

269
00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:46.487
with cryo coolers.

270
00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:51.033
so that it could create
a self-sustained blizzard.

271
00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:52.869
So. it'd stay frozen forever.

272
00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:55.246
You mean a snow globe?

273
00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:00.293
You know. it'd help if

274
00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:03.045
I wasn't the only one
coming up with good ideas.

275
00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:05.131
Passive aggressive. much?

276
00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:06.299
No. no. not passive...

277
00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:08.217
Passive aggressive
is getting Hirschfield's

278
00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:10.553
to put hummus on our sandwiches.

279
00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:14.348
Oh. wow. I didn't see you
getting butt-hurt over a sandwich

280
00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:15.349
on my bingo card today.

281
00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:17.143
Also. you love hummus.

282
00:16:17.226 --> 00:16:18.102
I do. I do.

283
00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:21.105
Hummus is wonderful.
but it's not a condiment.

284
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:22.732
Ketchup. is a condiment.

285
00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:25.234
Mustard. also a condiment.

286
00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:27.361
Hummus is like a side dish.

287
00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:28.654
No. no. Hummus is a dip.

288
00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:31.449
Easy. Condiment King.

289
00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:33.701
I don't need you
Runk-splaining hummus to me.

290
00:16:33.784 --> 00:16:35.995
I don't need you being so cavalier
with our sandwiches.

291
00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:38.956
Don't worry. because I am never
bringing you lunch ever again.

292
00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:42.168
Sorry. Sorry.

293
00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:44.045
Do you guys know
where the Arctic parkas are?

294
00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:46.088
The cozy ones?

295
00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:47.548
Yeah.

296
00:16:47.632 --> 00:16:48.674
Starchives.

297
00:16:48.758 --> 00:16:50.468
Right. Thank you.

298
00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:51.844
Gotta run.

299
00:16:51.969 --> 00:16:53.179
Ah!

300
00:16:57.934 --> 00:16:59.685
CCC tip app's blowing up.

301
00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:02.730
Something crazy is happening
at O'Shaughnessy's.

302
00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:04.982
Is Blockbuster here
to settle his late fees?

303
00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:06.567
No. it's not Blockbuster.

304
00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:09.362
but I have a feeling
we're going to wish it was.

305
00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:13.074
Aw. come on. man!

306
00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.251
I am a party god!

307
00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:34.887
We can never unsee this.

308
00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:36.597
Hey.

309
00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:38.641
Is that your friend?

310
00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:39.684
Uh...

311
00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:41.727
Because that jerk just froze
half the bar.

312
00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:44.939
Sorry.

313
00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:46.816
He's had a rough week.

314
00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:49.235
Here.

315
00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:53.823
I'm going on break.

316
00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:56.450
If he's not gone by the time I get back.

317
00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:57.743
I'm having him arrested.

318
00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:05.793
Hey. Chuckles. Garcia.

319
00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:07.670
Come to join the party. have you? Yeah?

320
00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:09.213
Yeah. you did.

321
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.426
What's your poison?

322
00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:15.553
You look like a Fuzzy Navel man.

323
00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:17.888
Coming right up.

324
00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:19.765
Thanks. but I actually...

325
00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:21.976
I actually don't drink.

326
00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:24.353
Awesome. More for us.

327
00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:46.459
Oh. big night out. huh?

328
00:18:46.709 --> 00:18:48.461
Yeah. I've been there myself.

329
00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:49.962
Sure.

330
00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:53.341
Right now. love is all
cupcakes. puppies and monster trucks.

331
00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:55.760
But just you wait until one of you dies

332
00:18:56.385 --> 00:18:58.304
battling an interdimensional
death demon.

333
00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:00.556
Oh. yeah.

334
00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:02.224
Pain is coming.

335
00:19:04.518 --> 00:19:06.437
Okay. okay. Yeah. yeah.
Use your knees.

336
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.773
There you go. No. no. Oh...

337
00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:09.899
You're okay. buddy.

338
00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:13.361
All right. You guys want to rob
a tech facility or something?

339
00:19:14.862 --> 00:19:16.072
It might quiet the voices.

340
00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:19.492
This man needs Vibeaccinos.
lots of them. I could run to Jitters.

341
00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:21.744
And leave me here with Chillbooze?

342
00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:22.870
No way.

343
00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:27.667
You know. you can't just shoot down
my ideas without offering another.

344
00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:29.877
Fine. let's get some food in him.

345
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.545
Do they serve fries here or something?

346
00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:32.880
They must.

347
00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:35.341
Ketchup bottle. see.

348
00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:36.717
Mustard bottle.

349
00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:38.469
Ooh. look.

350
00:19:39.053 --> 00:19:40.971
No hummus bottle. Case closed.

351
00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:43.182
- It's a condiment.
- It's a dip.

352
00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:45.393
- You're a dip.
- Well. call me hummus. then.

353
00:19:45.476 --> 00:19:47.269
-Ugh! You are impossible.
-I can't believe...

354
00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:48.270
Hey!

355
00:19:48.604 --> 00:19:49.438
-What?
-What?

356
00:19:50.773 --> 00:19:52.733
You two are really killing
my party's vibe.

357
00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:54.026
All right?

358
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.195
Besides. you're not even fighting.

359
00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:59.031
You're just doing what friends do. baby.

360
00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:03.619
Helping each other to see the world
in your own unique way.

361
00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:06.831
That's what Frost did for me.

362
00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:09.041
She shared her real self with me.

363
00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:14.380
Only I was too dumb to share me
with her. and now it is too late.

364
00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:20.344
But I'm glad
I got to see things her way.

365
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.152
Oh! All those muscles are heavy.

366
00:20:36.402 --> 00:20:37.778
Sweet dreams. party god.

367
00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:45.161
-Al. am so sorry.
-Chuck. I'm sorry.

368
00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:49.331
-l can't believe we're fighting.
-Over a dip.

369
00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:53.377
Yeah. I miss her. too.

370
00:20:54.003 --> 00:20:56.839
You know. even though Mark
might be drunk as a skunk.

371
00:20:57.923 --> 00:20:58.799
he was right.

372
00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:01.010
We are really good friends.

373
00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:02.511
The best.

374
00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:05.389
So if we listen to each other.
I'm sure we could find

375
00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:07.641
that one perfect thing to honor Frost.

376
00:21:08.142 --> 00:21:11.312
Yeah. actually.
now that I'm listening to you.

377
00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:14.940
I think that your costume idea
was on to something.

378
00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:17.818
-Yeah?
-Can I suggest one tweak. though?

379
00:21:18.861 --> 00:21:20.529
-For sure. Yeah.
-Okay.

380
00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:35.127
She told me she first felt
like a hero wearing this jacket.

381
00:21:36.337 --> 00:21:37.880
Now that's how we'll remember her.

382
00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:40.049
Always.

383
00:23:12.391 --> 00:23:15.185
Hold on to your badges.
We have a tight one.

384
00:23:15.895 --> 00:23:20.858
CSI Barry Allen and reigning champ.
Officer Daisy Korber.

385
00:23:20.941 --> 00:23:22.693
down to their last dog.

386
00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:24.320
And...

387
00:23:32.536 --> 00:23:35.873
Allen wins it
in the upset of the century!

388
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:38.876
Thank you.

389
00:23:41.629 --> 00:23:42.922
Fine.

390
00:23:43.839 --> 00:23:45.633
But I want a rematch next year. Allen.

391
00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:47.134
Sure.

392
00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:15.454
How long were you in there?

393
00:24:18.165 --> 00:24:19.917
I was hoping you could tell me.

394
00:24:20.876 --> 00:24:22.127
Hey. do you mind telling the contractors

395
00:24:22.211 --> 00:24:24.713
to knock off all the hammering
or whatever that is?

396
00:24:25.255 --> 00:24:28.342
Uh... That's not construction.

397
00:24:28.676 --> 00:24:29.802
Great.

398
00:24:30.594 --> 00:24:32.012
Guess I overdid it with the bourbon.

399
00:24:33.597 --> 00:24:37.726
And the tequila.
and the vodka.

400
00:24:39.728 --> 00:24:40.771
Hey. what's that?

401
00:24:41.397 --> 00:24:44.775
Uh. satellite scans
looking for Blockbuster.

402
00:24:44.858 --> 00:24:48.404
No sign of him yet. but...
he'll show up sooner or later.

403
00:24:48.696 --> 00:24:50.572
This team still isn't ready to face him.

404
00:24:51.532 --> 00:24:53.701
Not all that. I'm talking about this.

405
00:25:02.835 --> 00:25:04.586
Did you do all of these already?

406
00:25:08.298 --> 00:25:09.258
How are you doing?

407
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.220
I never even got to tell her how I felt.

408
00:25:15.055 --> 00:25:16.640
Did she ever tell you about the time
that she signed us up

409
00:25:16.724 --> 00:25:18.517
for a couples' tag-team
wrestling tournament?

410
00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:21.937
We crushed it. obviously.

411
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.232
But then she gave
our championship belts away

412
00:25:25.607 --> 00:25:27.985
to some kids at the ramen joint
where we were celebrating.

413
00:25:28.235 --> 00:25:29.486
Because it wasn't about winning.

414
00:25:30.112 --> 00:25:31.447
It was about the experience.

415
00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.576
-You really knew her well.
-I thought so. Yeah.

416
00:25:37.119 --> 00:25:40.956
I also thought finishing this list

417
00:25:41.123 --> 00:25:45.377
would be a way to honor her memory.

418
00:25:45.461 --> 00:25:49.798
But even with everything crossed off.
it still doesn't feel complete.

419
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.301
Look. man.

420
00:25:52.843 --> 00:25:56.138
As wild and crazy
as her lust for adventure was.

421
00:25:56.638 --> 00:25:59.808
what my Snowflake lived for
more than the thrills.

422
00:26:00.809 --> 00:26:02.394
was taking care of the people she loved.

423
00:26:03.771 --> 00:26:05.647
That's what she really wanted
to do with her life.

424
00:26:07.274 --> 00:26:10.277
Hell. she was literally born
to be Caitlin's savior.

425
00:26:12.988 --> 00:26:14.448
She never lost sight of that.

426
00:26:18.577 --> 00:26:20.454
I know how to honor Frost's memory.

427
00:26:22.706 --> 00:26:25.459
But right now. it seems impossible.

428
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:27.878
What's impossible for the Flash?

429
00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:43.936
‘Cause I'm not going
to any damn funeral.

430
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:47.439
Caitlin.

431
00:26:47.463 --> 00:26:49.463
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

432
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:50.646
-I'm still not going.
-I... I just came to apologize.

433
00:28:52.022 --> 00:28:53.941
And to listen.

434
00:28:55.234 --> 00:28:58.362
I suppose it's no use shutting the door
on someone who can phase through it.

435
00:29:00.113 --> 00:29:04.534
Look. Caitlin. um...
about yesterday morning in the lounge...

436
00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:07.329
It's fine.
I know you were just trying to help.

437
00:29:07.496 --> 00:29:10.874
You know. trying and knowing the right
words to say aren't the same thing.

438
00:29:10.958 --> 00:29:11.875
And I'm sorry.

439
00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:14.211
I said everything wrong.

440
00:29:14.711 --> 00:29:16.880
We've both been through a lot
over the last couple of days.

441
00:29:16.964 --> 00:29:18.882
so I think it's okay
to let ourselves off the hook.

442
00:29:19.258 --> 00:29:20.759
But you don't have to worry about me.

443
00:29:21.093 --> 00:29:22.261
I'm good. honest.

444
00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:28.183
You're still having trouble sleeping?

445
00:29:28.267 --> 00:29:29.393
I've had a lot on my mind.

446
00:29:29.476 --> 00:29:32.562
So. yes. I've had
a few sleepless nights.

447
00:29:32.646 --> 00:29:35.065
but medically speaking.
I'm not in any danger.

448
00:29:35.148 --> 00:29:36.566
So. thank you for coming.

449
00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:37.484
Caitlin.

450
00:29:37.734 --> 00:29:39.945
I know you'll regret
not going to your sister's funeral.

451
00:29:40.862 --> 00:29:41.780
Unbelievable.

452
00:29:42.447 --> 00:29:44.199
I mean. do you hear yourself right now?

453
00:29:44.741 --> 00:29:45.909
This isn't even about me.

454
00:29:45.993 --> 00:29:48.787
This is about you
and your need to be the hero.

455
00:29:49.246 --> 00:29:51.873
I am not one of your missions. okay?

456
00:29:52.249 --> 00:29:54.751
And not everything can just
be fixed with speed healing.

457
00:29:54.876 --> 00:29:57.796
But I need to grieve Frost
in my own way.

458
00:29:58.297 --> 00:30:01.717
So if you don't mind.
will you please leave?

459
00:30:07.014 --> 00:30:11.059
Look. Caitlin. I will leave you alone.
if that's what you really want.

460
00:30:11.143 --> 00:30:14.604
but before I go.
just ask yourself one thing.

461
00:30:17.107 --> 00:30:19.901
What would Frost want for you?

462
00:30:22.779 --> 00:30:26.658
You knew her better than anybody.
Would she want you to pull away?

463
00:30:27.284 --> 00:30:29.077
Would she want us to let you?

464
00:30:29.995 --> 00:30:31.621
But you have to promise me
something. all right?

465
00:30:31.955 --> 00:30:35.792
You will never shut yourself off from me

466
00:30:36.126 --> 00:30:37.461
or the rest of the team. all right?

467
00:30:42.966 --> 00:30:44.509
She'd tell me to stop being an idiot.

468
00:30:45.594 --> 00:30:48.305
Get off my ass and live my damn life.

469
00:30:49.806 --> 00:30:50.640
Hmm.

470
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:52.934
That does sound like her.

471
00:30:54.019 --> 00:30:55.812
You know.
Frost was the voice inside my head

472
00:30:57.147 --> 00:30:59.399
before I even knew she had a name.

473
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.738
She was the one telling me to be brave.

474
00:31:05.614 --> 00:31:07.449
To be strong when I felt weak.

475
00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:11.078
That I was never as powerless
as others made me feel.

476
00:31:15.665 --> 00:31:19.586
Barry. when Frost died.
her singing died. too.

477
00:31:20.796 --> 00:31:21.797
Her laugh.

478
00:31:25.384 --> 00:31:29.346
That voice...
That voice that made me whole.

479
00:31:32.849 --> 00:31:34.393
So I can't go to the funeral...

480
00:31:35.936 --> 00:31:38.188
because if I do.
if I see her in that casket...

481
00:31:41.817 --> 00:31:43.693
I'll know that she's gone for good.

482
00:31:47.239 --> 00:31:49.408
What if that's not the case?

483
00:31:50.867 --> 00:31:51.827
What do you mean?

484
00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:55.205
Her voice is still inside you.

485
00:31:56.456 --> 00:31:57.749
As long as that's true...

486
00:32:00.127 --> 00:32:01.378
She's not really gone.

487
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:12.222
Joe suggested that we all...
find a way to honor Frost.

488
00:32:14.433 --> 00:32:17.394
It was pretty hard finding my answer.

489
00:32:18.311 --> 00:32:20.689
But you? You just have to listen to her.

490
00:32:21.898 --> 00:32:23.775
So what's Frost saying
she wants you to do?

491
00:34:00.121 --> 00:34:02.374
Most of you know that I did not want
to be here today.

492
00:34:02.666 --> 00:34:03.792
Not at first.

493
00:34:04.918 --> 00:34:11.466
I was afraid that seeing her here
would make her death seem more real.

494
00:34:13.468 --> 00:34:14.386
And I was scared.

495
00:34:15.637 --> 00:34:18.682
You see. Frost was always
the fearless Snow sister.

496
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:21.434
Like that time
she went swimming with sharks

497
00:34:21.518 --> 00:34:23.061
and picked a fight with a shark.

498
00:34:24.813 --> 00:34:29.192
Or when she was at Jitters
for their Slam Poetry open mic night.

499
00:34:29.442 --> 00:34:30.986
and just grabbed the mic

500
00:34:31.861 --> 00:34:34.990
and read a poem she'd scribbled
on a napkin five minutes before.

501
00:34:35.865 --> 00:34:38.535
See. Frost was always honest.

502
00:34:42.581 --> 00:34:43.832
And the truth is...

503
00:34:46.835 --> 00:34:50.213
I thought that if
I saw my sister laying here.

504
00:34:53.174 --> 00:34:54.551
that I would have to say goodbye.

505
00:35:00.015 --> 00:35:01.224
But then...

506
00:35:04.185 --> 00:35:06.146
a friend of mine reminded me that

507
00:35:08.231 --> 00:35:09.232
that's not true.

508
00:35:10.567 --> 00:35:14.070
That she lives on in all of us.

509
00:35:15.196 --> 00:35:16.072
Not just in me.

510
00:35:18.074 --> 00:35:20.243
In her selflessness...

511
00:35:22.579 --> 00:35:24.873
her unique way
of seeing the world...

512
00:35:27.167 --> 00:35:29.794
...and her deep love
for her family and friends.

513
00:35:32.005 --> 00:35:36.384
So if we keep those parts of her
alive in us.

514
00:35:37.761 --> 00:35:38.887
then she's not really gone.

515
00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:43.391
And I can't think of a better way
to honor her memory.

516
00:36:01.368 --> 00:36:02.577
I'll keep you alive. Frost.

517
00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:04.579
I promise.

518
00:36:30.939 --> 00:36:32.273
It normally works.

519
00:36:33.733 --> 00:36:34.984
Dad. what were you thinking?

520
00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:36.528
Bleach takes out stains

521
00:36:36.611 --> 00:36:38.029
and the curtains were dirty. So...

522
00:36:38.113 --> 00:36:42.117
I'm sorry. but no. No.

523
00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:45.578
This whole retirement thing.
he's still real new at it.

524
00:36:46.287 --> 00:36:48.373
Look. this is the cleanest spot
in the whole house.

525
00:36:48.456 --> 00:36:52.001
and I would have done a whole lot more
if Frost hadn't taken

526
00:36:52.085 --> 00:36:54.796
my cleaning supplies for her collages.

527
00:36:54.879 --> 00:36:58.133
Oh. yeah. I still don't know
how she carried that stuff

528
00:36:58.258 --> 00:37:00.135
while ice-bridging across town.

529
00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:03.888
She didn't. People were finding sponges
and yellow gloves for miles.

530
00:37:03.972 --> 00:37:07.517
Actually. I think Wild Dog uses
one of Joe's mops as a bo staff.

531
00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.060
Really?

532
00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:11.312
This feels good.

533
00:37:11.896 --> 00:37:13.356
Remembering Frost like this.

534
00:37:14.691 --> 00:37:15.775
Your advice worked. Joe.

535
00:37:16.025 --> 00:37:18.361
That had more to do with you
than with me.

536
00:37:19.112 --> 00:37:20.321
It was a beautiful eulogy.

537
00:37:21.156 --> 00:37:24.159
More than anything we did to
honor Frost. you helped us heal today.

538
00:37:24.492 --> 00:37:26.536
Thanks for putting us back together.

539
00:37:27.537 --> 00:37:28.913
I didn't make it easy on you guys.

540
00:37:28.997 --> 00:37:32.625
So. thanks for telling me
what I needed to hear anyway.

541
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:35.086
Ooh.

542
00:37:37.505 --> 00:37:39.007
That Blockbuster jerk's back.

543
00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.884
I'll have Kramer call C.C.P.D.

544
00:37:41.009 --> 00:37:42.427
No way. This guy's ours.

545
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.179
Plus. we all wanted a rematch. right?

546
00:37:44.262 --> 00:37:46.473
And this time. we're ready.

547
00:37:46.765 --> 00:37:47.724
Barry?

548
00:37:48.767 --> 00:37:50.435
Tell Kramer to warm a holding cell.

549
00:37:51.519 --> 00:37:52.687
Let's go get this guy.

550
00:37:54.898 --> 00:37:57.150
I will tell the troops
to prepare an early headline.

551
00:37:58.818 --> 00:38:01.780
Hey.

552
00:38:02.489 --> 00:38:03.615
Do you have somewhere to be. too?

553
00:38:03.823 --> 00:38:04.657
Nope.

554
00:38:04.741 --> 00:38:06.659
Because I'd love to hear
some more stories about Frost.

555
00:38:07.577 --> 00:38:09.913
-I'd like that. too.
-I'm going to make us some coffee.

556
00:38:09.996 --> 00:38:10.914
Perfect.

557
00:38:27.096 --> 00:38:28.848
Hey. We need to talk.

558
00:38:32.519 --> 00:38:34.896
Hey.

559
00:38:35.647 --> 00:38:37.607
Hey. you know
it's rude to keep your guests waiting?

560
00:38:38.233 --> 00:38:40.151
I got a bar I'm supposed to be
getting thrown out of right now.

561
00:38:41.277 --> 00:38:43.988
Sorry. I thought I had time for one more
supply run before you got here.

562
00:38:45.073 --> 00:38:46.616
Is that a genome sequencer?

563
00:38:48.451 --> 00:38:50.912
-Yes.
-And did you steal it?

564
00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:52.664
I borrowed it.

565
00:38:52.747 --> 00:38:55.375
Whatever. Caitlin. Game recognizes game.

566
00:38:57.585 --> 00:38:58.962
Look. you called. I'm here.

567
00:38:59.671 --> 00:39:00.630
What do you want?

568
00:39:01.756 --> 00:39:02.715
Your help.

569
00:39:03.883 --> 00:39:04.717
Oh.

570
00:39:11.558 --> 00:39:13.518
Did you forget
to pay your electricity bill?

571
00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:23.444
Okay. That's not too creepy or anything.

572
00:39:30.076 --> 00:39:31.619
Caitlin. what is it that you want?

573
00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.206
I'm going to bring Frost back.

574
00:39:40.753 --> 00:39:41.921
And you're gonna help me.

575
00:39:50.889 --> 00:39:52.181
So. what do you think?

576
00:39:54.767 --> 00:39:57.353
I think we just found
tomorrow's front page.

577
00:39:57.437 --> 00:39:58.980
Crushed it!

578
00:40:00.106 --> 00:40:01.733
Uh... I mean. thank you.

579
00:40:01.816 --> 00:40:05.153
I will interface with publishing and get
this out the door ASAP.

580
00:40:05.236 --> 00:40:06.613
It's okay. Own it.

581
00:40:06.779 --> 00:40:08.823
This is a great article.
You should be proud.

582
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:13.202
Now. if you'll excuse me.
I still have a ton of work to do.

583
00:40:13.286 --> 00:40:15.330
It's gonna be a late night.

584
00:40:15.622 --> 00:40:16.748
Sure.

585
00:40:19.042 --> 00:40:22.045
By the way. it's really good
to have you back from Coast City.

586
00:40:22.837 --> 00:40:25.006
CCC Media was not the same without you.

587
00:40:25.757 --> 00:40:26.883
You guys had Allegra.

588
00:40:26.966 --> 00:40:28.217
I hear she did great filling in.

589
00:40:28.301 --> 00:40:29.427
From who?

590
00:40:31.679 --> 00:40:33.181
I'm. uh... I'm gonna leave now.

591
00:40:35.975 --> 00:40:38.645
But. hey. about
the Flash's latest takedown.

592
00:40:38.728 --> 00:40:40.313
I know he worked with Frost.

593
00:40:40.396 --> 00:40:43.900
but there have been reports
of him working with other people. too.

594
00:40:44.275 --> 00:40:45.902
Only no one knows who they are.

595
00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:49.030
Shouldn't we investigate them?

596
00:40:50.198 --> 00:40:51.532
Hmm. um...

597
00:40:51.991 --> 00:40:53.076
I will think about it.

598
00:41:05.755 --> 00:41:09.008
I forgot my... phone.

599
00:41:11.511 --> 00:41:12.512
Iris?

600
00:41:15.765 --> 00:41:16.599
Hmm.

601
00:41:16.623 --> 00:41:24.623
