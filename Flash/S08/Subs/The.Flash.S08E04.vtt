00:00:09.718 --> 00:00:12.971
Why is it so complicated
deciding how to have a baby?

2
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.516
The Batsuit isn't exactly baby-proof.

3
00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.934
but I can't force Sophie into

4
00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.436
nine months of indigestion
and swollen ankles.

5
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.979
Sis. you are spiraling.

6
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.815
Do you remember what I told you
when I was your maid of honor?

7
00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.984
No. I was busy getting married.
not taking notes.

8
00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:29.029
I told you to stop thinking so much
and to listen to your heart.

9
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.198
If you want to have a baby.

10
00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:32.950
your heart will figure out the "how."

11
00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:35.077
And then that sweet little girl

12
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.454
is going to grow up
and decide that she hates you.

13
00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:41.917
Jenna has been thinking
the worst insults at me tonight.

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.168
Let me tell you something. Teenagers...

15
00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:45.796
Do not use the bathroom. it's occupied.

16
00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:48.382
Really occupied.

17
00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:49.633
Thank you.

18
00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:50.759
Allegra!

19
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.511
Hey.

20
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:55.472
So. how's London?

21
00:00:57.057 --> 00:01:00.561
You calling cookies "biscuits" yet?

22
00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:06.024
Nope. But actually. I might be
moving back to the States.

23
00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:07.943
I got a job offer in Gotham.

24
00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:09.486
Oh. my gosh. Allegra. that's great.

25
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.989
Thanks. Yeah. I haven't decided
if I'm gonna take it or not yet.

26
00:01:12.114 --> 00:01:12.948
So...

27
00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.660
If I could have
everyone's attention for a minute.

28
00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:20.122
When you find...

29
00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:23.458
the love of your life.

30
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.336
you're part of something greater. you...

31
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:31.008
You're part of something wonderful.
magical. beautiful.

32
00:01:31.383 --> 00:01:36.305
and. frankly. surprising.
because you never know

33
00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:38.181
what face

34
00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:40.517
fate will be wearing

35
00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:43.895
when she knocks on your door
to change your life forever.

36
00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:47.774
And my only wish for you
is that when that face shows up

37
00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:51.361
to change your lives.
that that face is as beautiful

38
00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:55.324
as the one standing next to me.
To Iris West.

39
00:01:56.575 --> 00:01:57.701
The love of my life.

40
00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:10.881
What the hell is he doing here?

41
00:02:13.342 --> 00:02:16.928
You got a lot of nerve
showing up here. Allen.

42
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.306
It's been you this whole time.

43
00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:21.183
Despero.

44
00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:22.517
Armageddon. Joe--

45
00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:25.020
Don't you dare say my father's name.
you murderer!

46
00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:27.939
Guys. it's me. Barry.

47
00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:30.400
Iris is my wife.

48
00:02:32.194 --> 00:02:33.612
We've all fought Thawne together.

49
00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:37.240
My God. he actually believes
the things he's saying.

50
00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.744
All right. I'll show you it's me.

51
00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:50.087
Thawne. what did you do?

52
00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:54.925
You're not the Flash.

53
00:02:55.634 --> 00:02:56.468
Allen.

54
00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:04.559
I am.

55
00:03:32.838 --> 00:03:33.755
Team Flash.

56
00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:36.007
suit up.

57
00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:57.070
Guys.

58
00:03:57.696 --> 00:04:00.449
Thawne is tricking you.
I came here from 2021.

59
00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:01.366
Save it. Allen.

60
00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:04.828
I'm not falling
for your mind games this time.

61
00:04:06.872 --> 00:04:07.873
Put him down.

62
00:04:24.473 --> 00:04:27.642
It's a paralysis ray.
No speed for a couple seconds. Allen.

63
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.771
-Why are you doing this?
-So I can do this.

64
00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:03.553
That was for Ray and for Nate.

65
00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:04.846
And that was for Sara.

66
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.724
And this...

67
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.106
...is for Cisco.

68
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.500
So sorry. Allegra.

69
00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:35.418
But we did put a tie on the door.

70
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.255
What did we miss?

71
00:05:41.132 --> 00:05:43.426
Get away from me.

72
00:05:43.552 --> 00:05:46.680
Iris. you have to believe me.
Thawne's not the Flash. I am.

73
00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:48.181
He must have changed the timeline.

74
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.558
You're my wife.

75
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.853
This is our home. our loft.
We even have kids.

76
00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:55.313
-Bart and Nora.
-Stop!

77
00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.983
Please. you have to remember us.

78
00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:01.069
Iris. you're my lightning rod.

79
00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:05.490
You're psychotic.

80
00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:22.883
Iris West is my lightning rod now.
Reverse-Flash.

81
00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:26.094
What the hell did you do?

82
00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.721
Nothing you haven't done before.

83
00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:31.808
You created a Flashpoint.

84
00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:35.645
Wrong. I created a Reverse Flashpoint.

85
00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:40.525
I started by doing a little housekeeping
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

86
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.779
And then. I took care
of the one father you had left.

87
00:06:45.322 --> 00:06:46.156
Why?

88
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.366
Because after our last encounter.

89
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.577
it was clear to me
you're faster than I was.

90
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.040
And that the only way to defeat you...

91
00:06:57.584 --> 00:06:58.627
was to become you.

92
00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:03.840
So. I ran back
to the year 2013 and made sure

93
00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:06.635
that I was the one struck by lightning.

94
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:12.057
I was the one that Iris West wrote about
as the Streak. I led Team Flash.

95
00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:15.560
I was the one Iris West
fell in love with.

96
00:07:15.644 --> 00:07:17.145
I stole your life!

97
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.190
And because every hero needs a villain.

98
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.610
I created that. too.

99
00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:27.948
You wore my face.

100
00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:30.075
It was you
that attacked the city that day.

101
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:32.661
That's why they don't trust me.

102
00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:34.704
Made you think you were crazy.

103
00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:38.708
crazy enough to beg.

104
00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:43.213
literally beg Jefferson Pierce
to steal your speed.

105
00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:44.214
What's it at now?

106
00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:45.715
Five percent?

107
00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:47.342
Maybe less.

108
00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:49.260
Thawne. what you've done
destroys the world.

109
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.221
It creates Armageddon.

110
00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:53.515
-No.
-No. it's true. Damn it!

111
00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:56.434
I would not create a perfect world

112
00:07:57.978 --> 00:07:59.020
just to watch it die.

113
00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:00.438
As a matter of fact.

114
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:04.025
the only thing that is set to expire

115
00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:06.653
IS you.

116
00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:08.488
Do you know why?

117
00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:12.492
Because I finally did what I
set out to do all those years ago.

118
00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:17.414
I killed you as a child.

119
00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:21.292
You can do that all night long.

120
00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:26.172
But the fact remains. at the stroke
of midnight. my timeline will solidify.

121
00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:30.802
and you will cease to exist.

122
00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:35.640
And your precious Speed Force
cannot help you now.

123
00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:41.146
because in this timeline.
she chose me and Iris chose me.

124
00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:42.063
I've won!

125
00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:45.775
I finally won. Who's faster now?

126
00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:06.087
Earlier today.
protesters gathered downtown...

127
00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:10.258
...outside the penthouse
of Damien Darhk. demanding justice.

128
00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:14.637
Darhk. who was released from
Iron Heights Prison on a technicality...

129
00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:18.308
...was convicted six months ago
for the murders

130
00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:20.185
of A.R.G.U.S. director. Cisco Ramon.

131
00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:22.979
the heroic team known as the Legends.

132
00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:26.149
as well as tech philanthropist.
Ray Palmer.

133
00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.068
Meanwhile. Darhk's accomplice.

134
00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:32.822
the mass-murdering speedster.
the Reverse-Flash. is still at large.

135
00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:48.171
Barry Allen.

136
00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:52.342
I was wondering when my old partner
was going to come back and say hello.

137
00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:56.054
I hope you've been
laying low somewhere relaxing.

138
00:09:57.764 --> 00:09:59.182
I need your help again. Damien.

139
00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:00.683
Yeah. of course you do.

140
00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:03.520
Whoa! Mm.

141
00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:05.897
Huh.

142
00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:10.443
You seem... different.

143
00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:14.823
It seems like you're
running on empty. old friend.

144
00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:15.865
What happened to you?

145
00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:20.870
The Flash happened to me.
now I want payback.

146
00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:23.706
I like where this is going.

147
00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:25.667
Spill your tragic tale.

148
00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:29.337
Well. after you were arrested.

149
00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:32.966
-I fought the Flash and beat him.
-Yes!

150
00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:37.220
But before I could drive a hand
through his heart.

151
00:10:38.012 --> 00:10:39.222
he ran back in time.

152
00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:41.724
changed things. so he had won.

153
00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:43.935
He created an anachronism.

154
00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:45.436
Only it wasn't just one event.

155
00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:47.272
Thawne changed everything.

156
00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:50.233
Trying to stop him cost me my speed.

157
00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:54.320
Now we're living in a timeline
he constructed for his own benefit.

158
00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:55.446
Really?

159
00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:58.992
And that's downright villainous.

160
00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:00.493
Mm.

161
00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:02.996
We need to put him down.

162
00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:04.539
Yeah. we will. We will.

163
00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:07.167
Nobody gets to rig time except me.

164
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.711
But fixing this won't be easy.

165
00:11:10.044 --> 00:11:12.755
If the Flash created
multiple anachronisms.

166
00:11:13.047 --> 00:11:17.343
the only way to reset the timeline is to
turn everything back at the same time.

167
00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:18.803
which is why we need the P.E.D.

168
00:11:19.762 --> 00:11:21.181
-The P.E.D?
-The P.E.D.

169
00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:27.520
The Particle Eradication Distributor.

170
00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:30.607
The thing that erases
any type of matter.

171
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.651
You yanked it out
of Ray Palmer's cold dead hands.

172
00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:37.030
Right.

173
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.742
When you've killed as many people
as I have. you start to lose track.

174
00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:42.952
Huh.

175
00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:45.997
I sometimes forget...

176
00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:52.128
you're even darker than me.
Pun intended.

177
00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:55.173
All right. old partner.
Here's what we're going to do.

178
00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:59.177
If we combine the P.E.D.
and my Time Stone.

179
00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:02.597
any anachronisms on that temporal plane
will be erased.

180
00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:04.224
So this could work.

181
00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:06.476
Oh. it gets so much better.

182
00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:09.312
After my arrest.
they confiscated the P.E.D.

183
00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:11.356
Guess where it ended up?

184
00:12:19.697 --> 00:12:21.699
Frost. Chillblaine. and Batwoman
are searching the city.

185
00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:24.702
-but no sign of Reverse-Flash.
-And I can't feel him anymore.

186
00:12:24.786 --> 00:12:27.080
It's like he magically disappeared.

187
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.331
Then try harder.

188
00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:33.253
Cecile. um. we know that
you're doing your best.

189
00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:35.546
Yes. of course you are.

190
00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:39.008
What's up with him. anyway?

191
00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:40.510
Has he gone crazy?

192
00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:42.679
I mean. the guy actually thought
he was the Flash.

193
00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:45.306
He's a sociopath.
There's no explaining a mind like that.

194
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.891
Runk. where are we with the satellites?

195
00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:51.771
Runk?

196
00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:53.773
-What?
-Satellites?

197
00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:54.857
Right.

198
00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:59.237
Satellites are scanning
for his negative tachyons. sir.

199
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.657
But after analyzing samples
from Robern's.

200
00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:05.910
looks like the Reverse-Flash
is running on limited speed.

201
00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:08.079
Less speed means lower tachyon output.

202
00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:09.622
Making him harder to track.

203
00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:13.251
But not impossible if we sync
the Atom Bracelet's micro-sensors

204
00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:15.837
to the satellite.
That'll isolate the smallest tachyons

205
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.046
that'll give us Allen's location.

206
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.589
Consider it done. Captain Eo.

207
00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:21.342
Horton. use The Thinker's chair
to boost your empathic scan.

208
00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:23.261
Snow. get the med lab ready
in case there's trouble.

209
00:13:23.344 --> 00:13:25.013
Danvers. Garcia. weapons check.

210
00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:36.274
What are you thinking?

211
00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:42.655
Well. I'm thinking you should be at home
resting up for our big day tomorrow.

212
00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:44.365
I will.

213
00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:47.035
What?

214
00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:50.538
It's just that Allen seems off.

215
00:13:52.206 --> 00:13:54.125
Baby. he called me his lightning rod.

216
00:13:55.793 --> 00:13:56.919
Only you call me that.

217
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.504
I know.

218
00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:01.007
But he's smart.

219
00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:03.343
He's attacking our love.

220
00:14:03.426 --> 00:14:05.887
We cannot let him pull us apart.

221
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.014
He won't.

222
00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:10.350
I love you.

223
00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:11.517
I love you.

224
00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:19.233
What's the deal
with you and Chester?

225
00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:21.235
Nothing.

226
00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:23.780
-Why?
-The stolen glances.

227
00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:25.573
the nervous energy.

228
00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:30.203
You either hooked up. you are
hooking up. or you really need to.

229
00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:33.706
Okay. we did once. but it was
ten years ago and it went nowhere.

230
00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:35.291
What happened?

231
00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:40.588
We'd been flirting for months.
and one night we were playing D&D

232
00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.256
and it just happened.

233
00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:46.386
It was a really lusty quest.

234
00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:49.138
Anyway. I thought
something would come of it.

235
00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:53.726
But by the time I woke up
in the morning. Chester was gone.

236
00:14:54.268 --> 00:14:55.478
Hold up. he just left?

237
00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:56.396
Yep.

238
00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:58.314
And by the time we talked about it.

239
00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:00.858
we decided it was better
just to be friends.

240
00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:02.860
Bye-bye.

241
00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:13.037
And you know how much longer
until my new look is ready?

242
00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:15.581
I'm going to look so good
kicking bad guy butt.

243
00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:18.960
Just making some last-minute tweaks.

244
00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:21.587
Okay.

245
00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:24.966
Okay. good to go.
Now we can hunt some tachyons.

246
00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:26.884
It's working.

247
00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:29.095
According to these readings.

248
00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:31.264
there's a pocket
of negative tachyons in this room.

249
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.559
You had to ruin the surprise.
didn't you?

250
00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:37.728
You find the P.E.D..
I'll take care of these two.

251
00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:38.896
Hello. boys.

252
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.441
Ah-ah-ah.

253
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:48.739
Of course.

254
00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:53.327
Ooh! Tupac. What an artist!

255
00:15:57.331 --> 00:15:58.708
-I've got it.
-Already?

256
00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:01.502
You and I. what a team!

257
00:16:06.883 --> 00:16:07.800
Hurts. doesn't it?

258
00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.178
Well. so will this.

259
00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:27.028
Let's go.

260
00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:29.280
Oh. I've got a better idea.

261
00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.991
Imagine how devastating
it would be to the Flash

262
00:16:32.074 --> 00:16:34.911
to lose his friends
on the eve of his wedding.

263
00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:39.165
Nothing destroys a man
like losing the ones he loves the most.

264
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.252
What the hell was that?

265
00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:44.420
We got what we wanted.

266
00:16:44.962 --> 00:16:46.589
Killing them
wouldn't have been efficient.

267
00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:52.303
We can kill them later.

268
00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:54.847
Huh.

269
00:16:58.017 --> 00:17:00.436
The Barry Allen I know wouldn't wait.

270
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.313
which means you're not
the Reverse-Flash.

271
00:17:02.396 --> 00:17:04.732
So. who are you?

272
00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:15.576
Don't make me ask you again.

273
00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.994
Who are you?

274
00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:19.914
Thawne's the Reverse-Flash...

275
00:17:22.583 --> 00:17:24.544
Erased me from the timeline

276
00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:27.046
at midnight.

277
00:17:34.428 --> 00:17:36.347
Man. he is good!

278
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.183
I mean. that's like a work of evil art.

279
00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:40.643
The question is now
what do I do with you?

280
00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:43.437
You could still help me.

281
00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:44.605
"Help me?"

282
00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.065
Yeah. I'm the bad guy.

283
00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:47.650
I don't help heroes.

284
00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:50.945
But you're also a father.

285
00:17:51.862 --> 00:17:53.447
Which means you know what it feels like

286
00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:55.449
to love someone
with all your heart and soul.

287
00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:57.577
like your daughter. Nora.

288
00:17:57.868 --> 00:17:58.828
My Nora's dead.

289
00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:00.288
I'm done listening to you.

290
00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:01.581
She's supposed to be alive.

291
00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:04.750
And she is. in the timeline
I'm trying to restore.

292
00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:08.004
In my timeline.
a demon was going to take over her soul.

293
00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:09.589
but you switched places with her.

294
00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:13.384
You gave your own life
so she could live.

295
00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:21.601
If you're lying to me.
I'll see you burn.

296
00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:29.567
Nora! Nora!

297
00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:33.029
-Dad. why?
-Because I love you.

298
00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:37.617
And I couldn't watch you
become a monster like me.

299
00:18:47.084 --> 00:18:47.918
It's true.

300
00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:53.507
My Nora Doll's supposed to be alive.

301
00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.471
I sacrificed myself to save her.

302
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.808
So honor that sacrifice.

303
00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:08.147
Help me restore the timeline
and bring her back.

304
00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:14.195
Let's go to work.

305
00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:22.161
I guess you guys
haven't found Allen yet. huh?

306
00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:23.287
Nope.

307
00:19:24.538 --> 00:19:26.165
And Batwing called from Gotham.

308
00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:29.168
-Two-Face turned up. which means--
-You have to go.

309
00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:31.754
I will be at the ceremony tomorrow.
I promise.

310
00:19:32.254 --> 00:19:34.507
Until then. take this.

311
00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:37.718
It's a Velocity-Zero gun.

312
00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:41.305
Luke designed it the last time a certain
lady-in-red tried to kill us all.

313
00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:44.392
It will temporarily disrupt
Reverse-Flash's connection

314
00:19:44.475 --> 00:19:47.186
to whatever speed force
he's connected to.

315
00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:48.229
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

316
00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:49.730
Now. uh...

317
00:19:50.731 --> 00:19:52.191
you want to talk about
your other problem?

318
00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:57.029
I don't know. I've been
working on it since I got home.

319
00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:02.034
Every time I think about my future
with Eobard. my mind just...

320
00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:05.496
It goes blanker than that page.

321
00:20:05.788 --> 00:20:06.747
Any chance it's...

322
00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:08.791
just cold feet?

323
00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:09.959
I don't know.

324
00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:13.170
I love Eobard. I do.

325
00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:17.883
But when I think about what Allen said.
I mean. I just...

326
00:20:18.759 --> 00:20:19.635
I can't...

327
00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:22.471
I can't get it out of my head.
it's like it's haunting me.

328
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.725
Ryan. I've won two Pulitzers.

329
00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:27.935
Why can't I write my own wedding vows?

330
00:20:32.189 --> 00:20:33.065
Iris.

331
00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:36.986
Tonight. you told me to stop thinking
so much and listen to my heart.

332
00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:38.821
Yeah. okay. I get it.

333
00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:42.158
-That's what I'm supposed to do now.
-'Cause it works.

334
00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:48.164
Look. tonight I saved a kid
living in their van near the waterfront.

335
00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:50.624
Just like I was
before I found the Batsuit.

336
00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:56.839
Some lowlifes were mugging her.
and as I was kicking their asses.

337
00:20:57.381 --> 00:20:58.716
my heart told me what I want.

338
00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:03.012
I wanna save a kid. like Cora saved me.

339
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.893
So after I dropped their sorry asses off
at the nearest precinct.

340
00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:09.977
I called Sophie.

341
00:21:11.729 --> 00:21:12.730
We're gonna adopt.

342
00:21:15.691 --> 00:21:16.692
Ryan...

343
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:20.738
I'm so happy for you.

344
00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:22.031
Take your own advice.

345
00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:24.575
Trust me.

346
00:21:26.076 --> 00:21:29.288
if Eobard's the one. the vows will come.

347
00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:30.873
And what if he isn't?

348
00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:33.542
Then I will get you
out of here in a hot minute.

349
00:21:34.335 --> 00:21:35.795
My car drives really fast.

350
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.096
That's good work.

351
00:21:47.389 --> 00:21:49.475
-Martini?
-Dude.

352
00:21:50.184 --> 00:21:52.061
Right. you don't drink alcohol.

353
00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:53.354
Hey. Chester.

354
00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:55.773
Why did you ghost Allegra?

355
00:21:56.398 --> 00:21:58.567
- I never...
- Oh. here we go.

356
00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:01.070
Ten years ago.
the morning after you two hooked up.

357
00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:03.239
you snuck out while she was sleeping.

358
00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:05.741
First of all. that's not ghosting.
that's called the French exit.

359
00:22:06.075 --> 00:22:08.494
I never ghosted anyone. okay?

360
00:22:08.577 --> 00:22:10.955
I went to get coffee
and blueberry muffins.

361
00:22:11.956 --> 00:22:13.791
- Wait. What?
- Yeah.

362
00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:18.420
I wanted to have breakfast in bed.
watch the sun come up.

363
00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:20.464
Had the whole day planned.

364
00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.758
Because I knew even after one night.

365
00:22:22.842 --> 00:22:25.261
that I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with her.

366
00:22:25.594 --> 00:22:26.679
Dear God!

367
00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:29.390
When I got back.
she was gone. Alex. so...

368
00:22:30.474 --> 00:22:31.433
Allegra ghosted me.

369
00:22:31.517 --> 00:22:33.936
Which is why we always abide
by rule number one:

370
00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:35.604
Never return to the scene of the crime.

371
00:22:37.565 --> 00:22:38.858
Why didn't you ever tell her?

372
00:22:38.941 --> 00:22:40.317
I wanted to.

373
00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:42.695
but we were attacked
by the Legion of Doom.

374
00:22:43.612 --> 00:22:45.531
That week was seriously chaotic.

375
00:22:46.866 --> 00:22:47.992
And when the dust settled.

376
00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:51.120
I tried bringing it up again...

377
00:22:53.998 --> 00:22:54.957
but she cut me off.

378
00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:01.046
Told me that night was a huge mistake
and that we were better off as friends.

379
00:23:05.593 --> 00:23:07.094
I think I'm going to get some air.

380
00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.554
Yeah.

381
00:23:11.015 --> 00:23:11.849
Uh...

382
00:23:14.518 --> 00:23:16.854
See. this is what happens
when you try and play Cupid.

383
00:23:18.188 --> 00:23:19.732
What is your problem?

384
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:21.650
Why don't you love love?

385
00:23:21.859 --> 00:23:22.985
Okay.

386
00:23:23.402 --> 00:23:26.655
Love is just a chemical flood
of dopamine and oxytocin

387
00:23:26.906 --> 00:23:29.658
giving people an addictive dependence
like a bad drug.

388
00:23:29.742 --> 00:23:30.618
Science.

389
00:23:30.701 --> 00:23:34.079
It's taken me years to help Chuck
feel happy without Allegra.

390
00:23:34.163 --> 00:23:36.415
By telling him to hide his heart?

391
00:23:36.498 --> 00:23:39.418
Okay. now you're going to give me
a whole greeting-card-inspired speech

392
00:23:39.501 --> 00:23:42.546
about your perfect wife
and how she's the love of your life.

393
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:43.714
Okay. all right.

394
00:23:43.797 --> 00:23:45.799
All right. fine.

395
00:23:47.343 --> 00:23:51.221
But one day you're going to
wake up alone. and you're gonna realize

396
00:23:51.305 --> 00:23:53.891
that you missed out
on the best part of being human.

397
00:24:08.072 --> 00:24:12.034
Look. um.
according to these equations.

398
00:24:12.993 --> 00:24:16.372
I'd have to hit Mach 20
in order to open a time portal.

399
00:24:16.705 --> 00:24:17.539
Really?

400
00:24:17.915 --> 00:24:18.749
Yeah.

401
00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:21.043
And is that a problem?

402
00:24:23.504 --> 00:24:26.548
To reach that kind of speed.
I'd need 40.000 miles.

403
00:24:26.632 --> 00:24:28.008
That kind of runway doesn't exist.

404
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:32.346
Yes. it does.

405
00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:38.394
Is that big enough?

406
00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:42.356
Yes. but the Earth
isn't just a solid rock.

407
00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:43.899
It has a molten core.

408
00:24:44.441 --> 00:24:45.985
The kind of pressure
I'd be exerting on its mantle

409
00:24:46.068 --> 00:24:47.778
would cause cataclysmic damage.

410
00:24:48.487 --> 00:24:51.991
We're talking volcanoes erupting.
ice caps melting. earthquake. tsunami...

411
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:54.868
It'd be Armageddon.

412
00:24:55.452 --> 00:24:58.330
So in order to save the world
and bring my Nora back...

413
00:24:58.414 --> 00:24:59.748
I'd have to risk destroying it.

414
00:25:01.667 --> 00:25:03.127
Just like Despero predicted.

415
00:25:10.884 --> 00:25:11.844
Look. uh...

416
00:25:12.678 --> 00:25:15.514
I hate to break up your pity party.
but we're running out of time.

417
00:25:15.931 --> 00:25:18.142
Barry. you have to do this.

418
00:25:18.267 --> 00:25:21.770
Trust me. I want my life
and Iris back more than anything.

419
00:25:21.937 --> 00:25:22.896
But I've run the numbers.

420
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:24.940
I will have two minutes to accelerate

421
00:25:25.024 --> 00:25:26.525
before my destruction
destroys the world.

422
00:25:26.608 --> 00:25:28.152
Well. then you better run fast.

423
00:25:28.736 --> 00:25:32.489
Damien. the odds of me hitting Mach 20
in two minutes is two percent.

424
00:25:32.573 --> 00:25:33.657
It's better than nothing.

425
00:25:33.741 --> 00:25:35.034
Look. you don't understand.

426
00:25:35.117 --> 00:25:38.871
Despero says I cause Armageddon.
This is exactly what he described.

427
00:25:39.163 --> 00:25:42.499
I won't be responsible for killing
every single person on the planet.

428
00:25:42.583 --> 00:25:44.418
And what happens to those people
if you give up?

429
00:25:46.712 --> 00:25:50.049
You're leaving eight billion souls
in a world where Thawne has everything

430
00:25:50.132 --> 00:25:51.550
that he wants and nothing to lose.

431
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.343
-I'm still not fast enough.
-Fast enough?

432
00:25:54.803 --> 00:25:56.096
How dense are you?

433
00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.849
Speed isn't the only thing
that guides you through these things.

434
00:25:58.932 --> 00:26:00.225
-it never is.
-What else is there?

435
00:26:00.309 --> 00:26:02.227
Love. you idiot!

436
00:26:02.311 --> 00:26:03.604
You're the paragon of it.

437
00:26:03.687 --> 00:26:05.814
I saw what you did in the Time Stone.

438
00:26:05.939 --> 00:26:08.984
You restarted
an entire universe with love.

439
00:26:09.068 --> 00:26:10.110
This should be peanuts.

440
00:26:10.194 --> 00:26:11.987
That's not gonna work. not this time.

441
00:26:12.404 --> 00:26:13.280
Really?

442
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.366
Well. it's guiding
the both of us right now.

443
00:26:19.453 --> 00:26:20.621
Why do you think I'm helping you?

444
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.124
You think I want to die?

445
00:26:25.626 --> 00:26:26.460
I don't.

446
00:26:28.045 --> 00:26:29.588
But if sacrificing my life means

447
00:26:29.671 --> 00:26:32.174
that Nora gets to live the life
that Thawne stole from her.

448
00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:33.926
then yeah. I'm going to do it because...

449
00:26:35.177 --> 00:26:39.098
my love for her is what keeps me going
every damn day of my life.

450
00:26:41.225 --> 00:26:43.060
Who do you think
I built this whole empire for?

451
00:26:43.852 --> 00:26:44.686
And Iris?

452
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.980
Your family? Your friends?

453
00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.817
They are what keep you going.

454
00:26:52.069 --> 00:26:53.695
Iris doesn't remember what we had.

455
00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:54.947
Well...

456
00:26:55.697 --> 00:26:56.615
That doesn't matter.

457
00:26:58.867 --> 00:26:59.743
You do.

458
00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:07.668
You lied to me about Chester.

459
00:27:08.752 --> 00:27:10.170
Chester loves you.

460
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:14.758
When he went to tell you.
you cut him off.

461
00:27:16.009 --> 00:27:17.094
Why did you do that?

462
00:27:21.723 --> 00:27:25.561
You want to know how every relationship
in my life has ended?

463
00:27:26.979 --> 00:27:28.438
With me getting kicked to the curb.

464
00:27:30.023 --> 00:27:33.068
Everyone I've ever loved has left.

465
00:27:34.695 --> 00:27:36.613
When I woke up the next morning alone.

466
00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:40.117
it was like a trigger.

467
00:27:41.994 --> 00:27:44.955
Suddenly I was 12 years old again

468
00:27:45.622 --> 00:27:48.959
and my mom was telling me

469
00:27:49.042 --> 00:27:52.963
that my dad left us because of me.

470
00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:58.260
Yep. she was a bag of crap. too.

471
00:28:00.053 --> 00:28:03.557
The point is. I was crushed.

472
00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:10.189
So. when I saw Chester walking
up the street with coffees and a bag.

473
00:28:10.272 --> 00:28:13.233
I knew what that meant.

474
00:28:14.443 --> 00:28:15.861
how he felt about me.

475
00:28:16.945 --> 00:28:20.574
and I just freaked out.
and I pushed him away.

476
00:28:24.828 --> 00:28:25.662
You know...

477
00:28:28.832 --> 00:28:31.001
my wife is my rock.

478
00:28:32.544 --> 00:28:34.838
But things were not always perfect.

479
00:28:36.757 --> 00:28:37.591
Trust me.

480
00:28:38.425 --> 00:28:41.470
putting yourself out there. it's scary.

481
00:28:42.888 --> 00:28:45.098
But it's also so worth it.

482
00:28:48.936 --> 00:28:50.729
But what if I lose him?

483
00:28:52.105 --> 00:28:53.649
You'll never know unless you try.

484
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.360
Alex...

485
00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:01.114
the reason why I don't love love...

486
00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:05.702
is because nothing scares me more

487
00:29:06.328 --> 00:29:07.955
than putting my heart out on the line.

488
00:29:09.498 --> 00:29:10.791
So I make fun of romantics.

489
00:29:12.876 --> 00:29:14.461
But this whole Don Juan thing.

490
00:29:16.338 --> 00:29:17.172
it's just an act.

491
00:29:17.923 --> 00:29:19.216
-Really?
-l knew it.

492
00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:20.509
The truth is...

493
00:29:23.011 --> 00:29:25.305
I don't want to wake up alone
for the rest of my life.

494
00:29:27.808 --> 00:29:28.642
Look...

495
00:29:29.977 --> 00:29:30.978
Chester's my boy.

496
00:29:32.729 --> 00:29:34.273
and I know what my boy needs.

497
00:29:36.733 --> 00:29:37.651
He needs you.

498
00:29:43.532 --> 00:29:45.450
Guys.
we got a hit on Reverse-Flash!

499
00:29:46.994 --> 00:29:47.828
Let's go.

500
00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.840
I was just thinking about--

501
00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:04.261
I just want to talk. I swear.

502
00:30:04.386 --> 00:30:05.887
You take one more step
and I'm gonna shoot you.

503
00:30:07.097 --> 00:30:07.931
Okay.

504
00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:14.062
What's wrong with you? Are you dying?

505
00:30:15.814 --> 00:30:16.857
Something like that.

506
00:30:18.358 --> 00:30:22.738
I came here because I'm about
to do something impossible.

507
00:30:23.238 --> 00:30:24.781
And even though it might not work.

508
00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:27.784
I couldn't leave this world
without telling you that--

509
00:30:29.953 --> 00:30:31.288
Nice try. Allen.

510
00:30:32.122 --> 00:30:33.498
But she doesn't love you.

511
00:30:35.334 --> 00:30:36.335
She loves me.

512
00:30:37.461 --> 00:30:39.713
Tell him. Iris. Or better yet...

513
00:30:43.592 --> 00:30:44.426
shoot him.

514
00:30:55.312 --> 00:30:57.189
-Iris.
-What are you waiting for? Shoot him!

515
00:30:57.272 --> 00:30:59.441
I need you to know.
no matter what happens.

516
00:30:59.524 --> 00:31:02.652
after everything Thawne's taken from me.
he can't take away my feelings for you.

517
00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:05.572
I love you. Iris.

518
00:31:07.157 --> 00:31:08.033
Enough.

519
00:31:19.086 --> 00:31:21.380
Go... before I change my mind.

520
00:31:31.473 --> 00:31:33.350
- How'd it go with the missus?
- I don't know.

521
00:31:33.558 --> 00:31:34.768
But she let me go.

522
00:31:35.435 --> 00:31:36.353
Has to mean something.

523
00:31:36.436 --> 00:31:37.354
Well...

524
00:31:37.938 --> 00:31:38.855
Let's do this thing.

525
00:31:39.106 --> 00:31:40.565
Now I'll stay here.
your point of origin.

526
00:31:40.649 --> 00:31:42.192
just in case we get some visitors.

527
00:31:42.275 --> 00:31:43.318
But I'll be in touch.

528
00:31:43.777 --> 00:31:44.861
-How?
-Magic.

529
00:31:44.945 --> 00:31:46.863
You'll hear my voice wherever you go.

530
00:31:46.947 --> 00:31:49.616
Now remember.
you've got two minutes to reach Mach 20

531
00:31:49.699 --> 00:31:50.784
and open the temporal portal.

532
00:31:52.411 --> 00:31:53.286
Damien...

533
00:31:54.454 --> 00:31:55.288
thank you.

534
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.796
Get outta here.

535
00:32:08.718 --> 00:32:10.178
We tracked down the P.E.D.
and Reverse-Flash.

536
00:32:10.262 --> 00:32:11.805
He's crossing the Atlantic Ocean.

537
00:32:11.972 --> 00:32:13.849
What the hell is he doing?

538
00:32:13.932 --> 00:32:15.058
He's destroying the city.

539
00:32:15.142 --> 00:32:16.852
It's like the end of days out here.

540
00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:18.770
Holy crap. It's not just the city.

541
00:32:18.854 --> 00:32:21.815
Allen's speed wake is causing the globe
to tear itself apart.

542
00:32:22.732 --> 00:32:24.276
It's an extinction-level event
in progress.

543
00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:26.695
He's right. I'm tracking
at least a hundred earthquakes.

544
00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:28.071
A tsunami just hit Japan.

545
00:32:28.196 --> 00:32:29.573
Allen really has lost his mind.

546
00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:32.409
He realized he can't win.
so he's trying to kill us all.

547
00:32:32.492 --> 00:32:33.368
I have to go.

548
00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:34.578
I gotta go get Jenna.

549
00:32:34.661 --> 00:32:36.663
Guys.
Mark and I could use backup.

550
00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:38.081
Go. I'll stay here.

551
00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:39.708
Okay.

552
00:32:40.709 --> 00:32:41.918
Hey. not to be that guy.

553
00:32:42.002 --> 00:32:44.171
but since this could be the end
of the world as we know it.

554
00:32:44.254 --> 00:32:46.131
if anyone has anything to say.

555
00:32:46.381 --> 00:32:47.299
now would be the time.

556
00:32:50.385 --> 00:32:51.636
Right.

557
00:32:54.764 --> 00:32:56.141
The Reverse-Flash just hit Europe.

558
00:32:56.683 --> 00:32:57.976
Where's Eobard?

559
00:32:58.226 --> 00:33:00.061
I'm right behind him.

560
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:07.319
Hey. Flash. you've got company.

561
00:33:13.867 --> 00:33:14.784
Guess what. Darhk?

562
00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:16.286
So do you.

563
00:33:23.293 --> 00:33:26.338
Frosty. Chill-Lame.

564
00:33:26.421 --> 00:33:27.839
Yeah. I'm a little bit busy.

565
00:33:27.923 --> 00:33:31.593
But you do realize my abilities
give me the power

566
00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:34.804
to draw and quarter
with a gesture. right?

567
00:33:35.388 --> 00:33:36.723
Oh.

568
00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:39.267
Not for the next 24 hours. you don't.

569
00:33:39.351 --> 00:33:42.604
Our friend. John. gave us
a badass protection spell.

570
00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:45.857
Constantine. I hate that guy.

571
00:33:45.982 --> 00:33:47.234
Yeah. well. too bad.

572
00:33:47.734 --> 00:33:49.694
Looks like we get to kick
this guy's ass all night.

573
00:33:50.028 --> 00:33:51.321
Won't even take that long.

574
00:33:52.697 --> 00:33:53.532
Really?

575
00:33:54.282 --> 00:33:55.742
Let's see how that goes.

576
00:34:05.377 --> 00:34:07.712
If Boss doesn't catch Allen
in the next 90 seconds...

577
00:34:08.338 --> 00:34:09.673
-Chester...
-Eighty-five.

578
00:34:10.215 --> 00:34:11.424
-Chester.
-Eighty-four.

579
00:34:11.508 --> 00:34:12.717
-Chuck!
-What?

580
00:34:12.801 --> 00:34:13.802
I love you!

581
00:34:16.346 --> 00:34:17.472
Yeah. well. I love you. too!

582
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:30.193
When did this happen?

583
00:34:37.158 --> 00:34:38.243
This is not working!

584
00:34:39.035 --> 00:34:40.287
I'm still not fast enough!

585
00:34:41.663 --> 00:34:43.248
I'm trying to save
my daughter here. Allen.

586
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.334
Focus!

587
00:35:11.401 --> 00:35:13.028
Never dance with the devil.

588
00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:27.125
Yeah. I increased the molecular density
on that little toothpick of yours.

589
00:35:27.208 --> 00:35:29.461
a thousand-fold at the sub-atomic level.

590
00:35:31.212 --> 00:35:32.464
Good luck trying to lift two tons.

591
00:35:33.548 --> 00:35:35.383
I hate science.

592
00:35:40.472 --> 00:35:42.265
Then you are really gonna hate that.

593
00:35:47.687 --> 00:35:49.522
-Thanks for the assist.
-Of course.

594
00:35:49.648 --> 00:35:51.983
- Hey. nice threads.
- Thanks. man!

595
00:35:55.779 --> 00:35:56.905
We're running out of time.

596
00:35:57.155 --> 00:35:58.073
Sixty seconds.

597
00:35:58.406 --> 00:35:59.407
Come on. Flash.

598
00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:04.579
You're too late. Allen.

599
00:36:05.413 --> 00:36:06.414
You're too late!

600
00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:15.924
Iris...

601
00:36:19.594 --> 00:36:20.428
Iris...

602
00:36:22.138 --> 00:36:23.306
Barry. I love you. too.

603
00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.183
I love you. too.

604
00:36:44.619 --> 00:36:46.246
You're no hero.

605
00:36:46.913 --> 00:36:48.289
You are a monster!

606
00:36:48.456 --> 00:36:51.084
I'm going to ask you one last time.
Miss Horton.

607
00:36:51.584 --> 00:36:55.672
And if I don't like your answer. you'll
join your friends in the afterlife.

608
00:37:04.931 --> 00:37:05.807
Now...

609
00:37:06.182 --> 00:37:07.267
the Flash...

610
00:37:08.017 --> 00:37:08.852
Where is he?

611
00:37:09.978 --> 00:37:12.856
I told you. I don't know!

612
00:37:16.276 --> 00:37:17.152
You know what?

613
00:37:18.987 --> 00:37:19.904
I believe you.

614
00:37:34.753 --> 00:37:35.587
What is this?

615
00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:04.199
Flash. what did you do?

616
00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:08.828
I went to the future.

617
00:38:10.872 --> 00:38:11.706
Iris was right.

618
00:38:12.707 --> 00:38:15.460
Someone manipulated the timeline
to drive me insane.

619
00:38:17.378 --> 00:38:18.797
Turns out. in order to fix it.

620
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:21.007
I had to start Armageddon.

621
00:38:22.425 --> 00:38:24.260
Only this time.
I didn't destroy the world.

622
00:38:26.262 --> 00:38:27.472
How is that possible?

623
00:38:28.056 --> 00:38:31.434
You left 2031 before the world ended.

624
00:38:33.269 --> 00:38:35.563
What you didn't know
was that Eobard Thawne.

625
00:38:35.647 --> 00:38:37.774
the Reverse-Flash. was chasing me.

626
00:38:38.942 --> 00:38:41.194
He wanted to stop me
from restoring the timeline.

627
00:38:42.195 --> 00:38:43.947
The speed wake created by us both.

628
00:38:45.198 --> 00:38:48.034
That is what caused
the destruction you saw.

629
00:38:49.369 --> 00:38:52.580
If that's happened. what stopped you
from tearing this world apart?

630
00:38:53.039 --> 00:38:53.873
Iris.

631
00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:57.252
She helped me reconnect
to the Speed Force.

632
00:38:59.003 --> 00:39:00.046
Now the future's safe.

633
00:39:03.967 --> 00:39:05.885
I can see you believe it to be true.

634
00:39:06.594 --> 00:39:07.637
And as a traveler in time.

635
00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.765
my senses confirm this world
has been altered.

636
00:39:13.226 --> 00:39:14.686
But as for the true reason...

637
00:39:17.188 --> 00:39:18.982
well. that remains to be seen.

638
00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:22.277
Maybe you should go to 2031

639
00:39:23.236 --> 00:39:24.404
and see for yourself.

640
00:39:34.914 --> 00:39:35.790
I shall.

641
00:39:35.999 --> 00:39:38.209
But if you're wrong
or if I find any evidence

642
00:39:38.293 --> 00:39:41.838
that this world is still in danger.
I will return.

643
00:39:42.881 --> 00:39:44.549
and you will die.

644
00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:52.223
Yeah.

645
00:39:52.307 --> 00:39:54.809
- Gluten-free? Cecile.
- Gluten-free.

646
00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.854
-Here you go.
-Nice.

647
00:39:57.979 --> 00:40:00.481
You have yours. right?
Is there drinks?

648
00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:03.610
Hey. babe!

649
00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.195
Uh. I would've got you something.

650
00:40:06.446 --> 00:40:08.156
working through lunch
at the precinct today.

651
00:40:08.281 --> 00:40:09.490
Don't worry. there's plenty.

652
00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:11.117
Got a burger for you. boss.

653
00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:20.001
I missed you so much.

654
00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:23.004
Not that I don't love
this attention. but...

655
00:40:24.005 --> 00:40:25.381

656
00:40:26.716 --> 00:40:29.052
Barry. you okay?

657
00:40:31.387 --> 00:40:32.680
Something happened. didn't it?

658
00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:36.684
What was it?

659
00:40:40.063 --> 00:40:41.230
Later. all right?

660
00:40:41.814 --> 00:40:42.941

661
00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:44.943
With all of you.

662
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:47.946

663
00:40:48.363 --> 00:40:49.781

664
00:40:51.783 --> 00:40:52.909

665
00:40:53.159 --> 00:40:53.993

You're really there.

671
00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:37.120
Nobody uses time against me.

672
00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:41.749
I will live.

673
00:41:43.001 --> 00:41:45.336
I will change what's about to happen.

674
00:41:47.255 --> 00:41:49.424
And you will help me.
