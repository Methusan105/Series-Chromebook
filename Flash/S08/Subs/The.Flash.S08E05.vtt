ï»¿1
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.049
Of course I'm really here. Barr.

2
00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:10.552
You're sounding kinda strange.
Are you okay?

3
00:00:14.223 --> 00:00:15.349
I am now. Yeah.

4
00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:18.560
Yeah.

5
00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:20.354
Okay.

6
00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:24.608
You wanna tell me
what's really going on?'

7
00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:26.610
You don't remember either.

8
00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:31.240
Thawne.

9
00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:33.700
He...

10
00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:37.287
He changed things.
Made me think I was crazy.

11
00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.039
He took away my life.

12
00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:41.375
Piece by piece. until I lost everything.

13
00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:45.921
Thawne started his own
Reverse-Flashpoint.

14
00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:48.924
Joe. you died.

15
00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:50.467
Uh...

16
00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:52.803
Well.

17
00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:55.347
I'm so sorry...

18
00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:58.183
you went through that.

19
00:00:59.268 --> 00:01:00.644
Hey. Listen to me.

20
00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:02.854
I'm here now

21
00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:04.356
and I'm not going anywhere.

22
00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:07.192
I know it's...

23
00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:11.154
Seeing you again.
after everything that's happened.

24
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.451
It's just like
I can finally breathe again.

25
00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:19.580
Nothing like
a second shot at life.

26
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.574
Barry. why is there a super villain
standing in my living room?

27
00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:57.326
Thank you.

28
00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.077
But I'm not here to cause trouble.

29
00:01:59.328 --> 00:02:00.704
Damien. how are you still here?

30
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:02.289
I don't know. My theory.

31
00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:04.833
I was connected
to the Time Stone you were wearing.

32
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:08.754
When you created a portal.
it drew me to 2021 also.

33
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:11.256
Although I haven't faded yet.

34
00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:13.425
I'm sure. I soon will.

35
00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:15.385
-Once you do?
-I die.

36
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.430
But my daughter Nora lives.

37
00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.974
Only that hasn't happened yet
and I don't know why.

38
00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:23.977
Maybe if I had the Time Stone.

39
00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:29.524
That was handy.

40
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.361
-Damien. what you're doing now--
-I'm no hero. Barry.

41
00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:35.614
I'm just a dad.

42
00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:49.294
Freeze!

43
00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:51.588
You are under arrest!

44
00:02:51.672 --> 00:02:52.881
For what. officers?

45
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:55.384
I haven't even done anything.

46
00:02:57.386 --> 00:02:58.220
Yet.

47
00:02:58.929 --> 00:02:59.971
Do you want to know why?

48
00:03:01.223 --> 00:03:04.393
Because I'm not ready to die yet!

49
00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.773
I can't believe everything
that you went through.

50
00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.942
I mean. these last few days
have been so...

51
00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:13.276
normal.

52
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.820
Boring even.

53
00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:17.781
I mean. I'm glad nobody remembers.

54
00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.534
And Frost and Chillblaine were married?

55
00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.744
-Apparently.
-That's insane.

56
00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.996
What about Chuck and me?
What were we doing?

57
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.040
I mean same as now. I guess.

58
00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:29.543
I don't know.
I mean. we weren't really teammates

59
00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:30.669
in that other timeline.

60
00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:33.588
I do know Chester helped build
the energy absorption tech

61
00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.006
that saved the world. Hold on.

62
00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:37.843
Here you go.

63
00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:40.971
Holy Ron Mallets!

64
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.848
Circuitry is next level.

65
00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:44.558
Okay. nice work. future me.

66
00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:46.268
But is it okay that I have this?

67
00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:48.812
I don't want to start like.
a Chester-P-point.

68
00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:51.773
I mean. maybe just don't
talk about it on your podcast.

69
00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:53.608
Got you.

70
00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:56.945
Well. Barr. you risked everything
to prevent Armageddon

71
00:03:57.154 --> 00:03:59.698
and gave all of us a second chance.

72
00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:03.285
And we're really damn grateful.
Especially me.

73
00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:05.120
Ditto.

74
00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.039
You really are a true hero. Barry.

75
00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:13.295
It's Taylor with a news alert.

76
00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.213
Thawne is at C.C.P.D.

77
00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:23.930
Ah-ah.

78
00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:25.891
I know what you're thinking.

79
00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:29.686
You're thinking. why did I do that?

80
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.065
Well. I did it to draw out your hero.

81
00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:38.528
What is taking him... so long?

82
00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:39.613
You want a hero?

83
00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:53.418
You?

84
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.756
You know. normally...

85
00:04:58.507 --> 00:05:01.802
I'd be intrigued
to meet the great Green Arrow.

86
00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:04.179
but unfortunately. today...

87
00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:06.389
I don't have the time.

88
00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:07.641
Where's William?

89
00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:09.726
-Who is William?
-Wrong answer.

90
00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:13.355
Oopsie.

91
00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:15.232
That's a temporal fade. pal.

92
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:18.109
Looks like you're not too much longer
for this timeline.

93
00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:19.820
Too bad.

94
00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:21.154
Now.

95
00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:22.948
Where the hell's my brother?

96
00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:25.158
Enough with the questions.

97
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.163
Sorry. kid.

98
00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:34.584
I don't have time for family drama.

99
00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:44.803
Stay down. Thawne.

100
00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:47.138
Flash.

101
00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:56.064
I didn't come here to fight.

102
00:05:56.982 --> 00:06:03.655
I came here to make a scene publicly!
So that there would be witnesses

103
00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:06.324
for what I have to ask you.

104
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.576
What is it?

105
00:06:08.577 --> 00:06:10.662
I need you to save me.

106
00:06:23.592 --> 00:06:25.385
So Thawne messed with the timeline?

107
00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:28.388
No wonder
I picked up on his temporal energy.

108
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:29.556
He must be loaded with it.

109
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.433
Is that why you're here in 20217?

110
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.019
No. I tracked Thawne's scent by mistake.

111
00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.021
I was looking for something else.

112
00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.772
Maybe we can help?

113
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.942
I'm Chester P. by the way.
New guy.

114
00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:43.612
And it is so cool to meet
the future Green Arrow.

115
00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:45.238
Mia Queen!

116
00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:48.450
Progeny of Felicity Smoak
and Oliver Queen.

117
00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:50.035
I know all the stories.

118
00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:51.870
Not all the stories.

119
00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:55.290
Look. what did Thawne mean
when he said. "Save me"?

120
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:56.875
Save him from what?

121
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.295
You see how he's... fading in and out.

122
00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:02.631
Same thing happened to me
in his Reverse-Flashpoint.

123
00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:03.715
He's being erased.

124
00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:07.344
Once the process is complete. he'll die.

125
00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:12.766
So when you removed Thawne's changes.
the timeline decided to remove him. too.

126
00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:14.017
Yeah.

127
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.562
Okay. but when Thawne died.
he came back somehow after Eddie.

128
00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:18.980
I mean. could that happen again?

129
00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:20.690
No. this is different.

130
00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:23.902
When I reset the timeline.
I used Damien's Time Stone.

131
00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:26.488
It eliminated
all possible time variables.

132
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.199
restoring a single.
permanent timeline again.

133
00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:32.410
-This one.
-So if he dies this time...

134
00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:34.245
It's game over for good.

135
00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:36.331
Okay. I need to call Frost.

136
00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:37.749
If we're going to decide
what to do about Thawne.

137
00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:38.875
we need the whole team here.

138
00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:42.545
Wait a minute. You're not actually
considering saving him. are you?

139
00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:45.840
Mia. we know that Thawne is bad.
but we still need to talk this through

140
00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:47.384
before we make any decisions.

141
00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:49.803
Fine.

142
00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:51.972
If that's how you guys do things.

143
00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:54.516
But you're making a big mistake.

144
00:07:58.436 --> 00:07:59.729
I will go talk to her.

145
00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:04.317
You see if you can find out
how much time Thawne has left.

146
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:06.341
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

147
00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:26.923
You want something?

148
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.718
Mia.

149
00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:33.888
You never said why you came to 2021.
But I'm guessing it's important.

150
00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:35.015
So...

151
00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:36.433
what is going on?

152
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.186
I'm here to find my brother.

153
00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:42.856
William's missing.

154
00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:45.900
I just hit another dead end.

155
00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:49.487
What happened?

156
00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.661
It was the night
I decided to put on the suit.

157
00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:04.127
William and I went to see Dad's statue.

158
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.045
But...

159
00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:06.671
we were attacked.

160
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.633
I haven't seen my brother since.

161
00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:14.304
I've been looking for him for two years.

162
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.389
I'm so sorry.

163
00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:20.852
Found a temporal energy signature
at the crime scene which led me here

164
00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:24.022
but. every trail goes cold.

165
00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:29.277
Now this is all I have left of him.

166
00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:32.280
William gave it to me the night
he was taken.

167
00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:35.492
Sometimes I wonder if it's connected
to why he's still gone.

168
00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:37.494
Have you asked Felicity for help?

169
00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:40.413
She wouldn't understand
what I've had to do to get this far.

170
00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:42.082
What is that supposed to mean?

171
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.834
Mia. have you--

172
00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:46.002
Killed anyone?

173
00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:48.213
I will if I have to.

174
00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:50.131
For William's sake.

175
00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:55.261
Sometimes blood for blood is the answer.

176
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.430
You know. your dad thought
the same thing once.

177
00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:02.143
That in order to protect his city.
he had to take lives.

178
00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:04.729
But all he ended up doing
was ruining his own.

179
00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:06.981
I think you know that.

180
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:11.194
Or else you wouldn't be
so afraid to go see your mom.

181
00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:12.904
You're the one who's afraid.

182
00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:15.281
Thawne killed your dad.

183
00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:17.992
and then tricked you
into almost marrying him.

184
00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:21.079
All the while making you believe
you had a choice in it all.

185
00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:22.956
You.

186
00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:25.667
Iris West-Frakkin' Allen.

187
00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:29.337
And now you're too afraid
to give him what he deserves.

188
00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:32.841
You think my life will be ruined
if 1 Kill?

189
00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.594
What about yours if you don't?

190
00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:41.891
Because it sounds like you'd be
a lot better off if he was gone.

191
00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:55.905
How much longer do I have?

192
00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:57.699
Best I can tell...

193
00:10:58.575 --> 00:10:59.534
Two hours.

194
00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.203
And then you'll fade away.

195
00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:05.248
Two hours until you save me. Right?

196
00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:07.083
Caitlin. because you...

197
00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:10.253
Barry and Team Flash.

198
00:11:10.753 --> 00:11:12.046
you are the good guys.

199
00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:13.965
You'll do the right thing.

200
00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:15.884
Some of us might surprise you.

201
00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:18.678
But not you. you're a doctor.
You won't kill me.

202
00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:21.598
No. I won't.

203
00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:25.768
But I can accept it when someone dies.

204
00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:27.145
Is that right?

205
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:29.898
Maybe you forget?

206
00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:32.984
I know the real Caitlin Snow.

207
00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:36.863
You're right where you were.
eight years ago. Remember?

208
00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.199
Living your safe...

209
00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:42.035
orderly life.

210
00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:44.662
Preparing for a perfect future.

211
00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:47.916
With your idiot fiancÃ©.

212
00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:51.169
And then...

213
00:11:54.797 --> 00:11:58.051
It all came crashing down.

214
00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:00.220
What is wrong with you?

215
00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:05.475
Ronnie was my whole future
and he is never coming back.

216
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:06.893
He's never coming back.

217
00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:08.645
That's what happens. What about you?

218
00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:11.397
You could have moved on.

219
00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:14.108
I mean. you should have moved on.

220
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.195
But instead. you're stuck here
where you were eight years ago

221
00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:22.200
helping Team Flash and Barry Allen
instead of getting on with your life.

222
00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:23.326
Fine.

223
00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:25.954
You want honesty?

224
00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.042
When I was a resident.
fresh out of med school.

225
00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:33.044
one of the first things
they taught me...

226
00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:37.507
is that sometimes you lose a patient.

227
00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:41.636
That death is a part of life.

228
00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:44.222
So guess what?

229
00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:47.058
It's your turn.

230
00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:52.188
Because all the speed in the world

231
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.650
can't help you out run
what's coming for you.

232
00:12:56.651 --> 00:13:00.363
You'll save me. you'll save me. Snow.
You don't have a choice.

233
00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:04.242
And another thing.

234
00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:08.121
I stayed here because Barry
and the rest of the team.

235
00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:12.000
they're not just friends.
they're family.

236
00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:15.003
And just so we're clear...

237
00:13:15.837 --> 00:13:19.590
What I've been doing
for the last eight years...

238
00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:22.385
is hating you.

239
00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:28.099
So if you're looking for someone
to save you.

240
00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:31.728
look somewhere else.

241
00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:47.493
You okay?

242
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.204
What happened?

243
00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:53.708
We need to let Thawne die.

244
00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:15.855
Caitlin told me about your talk.

245
00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:18.358
Something I want to know.

246
00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:23.112
Why did you create a Reverse-Flashpoint
to steal my life?

247
00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:24.447
Why?

248
00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:27.700
That was the best way to hurt you.

249
00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:32.246
Don't you have anything better to do
than trying to destroy my life?

250
00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:33.706
Destroying you is my life.

251
00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:37.502
That still doesn't explain why.

252
00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:38.711
Why what?

253
00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:40.838
What did I ever do to you?

254
00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:47.387
Almost two centuries...

255
00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:49.972
from right now.

256
00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:53.059
we meet

257
00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:56.229
for the very first time.

258
00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:58.648
For my part.

259
00:14:59.273 --> 00:15:02.860
I finally discovered ways
to possess speeds.

260
00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:05.446
speeds faster than anyone alive.

261
00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:10.785
And. just as I was about
to present myself to the world...

262
00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:14.664
you showed up.

263
00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:19.544
In pursuit of some stupid case
and dazzled the crowd.

264
00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.004
You were dazzling. And then...

265
00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:25.174
and then you saved the crowd.

266
00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:32.682
A crowd that I was meant to save.
a crowd that was meant to thank me.

267
00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:35.685
you stole... my greatest moment.

268
00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.061
I admired you.

269
00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:41.858
And you humiliated me.

270
00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:48.072
And it was in that moment.
I knew I had to get faster than you.

271
00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:54.745
Only a sociopath...
would react to something so small

272
00:15:55.496 --> 00:15:56.914
with that kind of rage.

273
00:15:58.166 --> 00:15:59.834
What you call rage...

274
00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:04.797
I call commitment.

275
00:16:06.883 --> 00:16:08.509
So if you won't stop hating me.

276
00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:13.055
what happens once I save you?

277
00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:15.892
I'll just go on with my life's work.

278
00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:19.979
Finding new ways to kill you.

279
00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:30.823
You know
what to do. Flash.

280
00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:34.118
What are you doing here?

281
00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:36.454
I went to the future to see for myself.

282
00:16:36.537 --> 00:16:38.539
Whether or not Armageddon
had been prevented.

283
00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:39.499
Then you know that it was.

284
00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:42.793
Yes. but I also witnessed
the return of your rival.

285
00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:45.546
You must know
as long as Eobard Thawne lives.

286
00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:48.049
he can still bring about
another Armageddon.

287
00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:49.467
So what do you want me to do?

288
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:50.593
Listen to your friend.

289
00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:51.719
Let him die.

290
00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:54.347
If you want him dead so much.
why don't you just kill him yourself?

291
00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:58.559
I would. but he could come back.
as he did before.

292
00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:03.189
This is the only way
to assure his absolute death.

293
00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:09.070
You know it's the right thing to do.
Flash.

294
00:17:15.743 --> 00:17:17.161
You can't be serious.

295
00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.372
You can't just let Thawne die.

296
00:17:19.997 --> 00:17:22.542
I gave him a chance
to prove he can change.

297
00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:24.627
He can't.

298
00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:27.797
So. what? We just kill him?

299
00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:31.551
Thawne messed with the timeline
and now the timeline is fighting back.

300
00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:33.052
I say we let it.

301
00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:34.720
Me. too.

302
00:17:36.013 --> 00:17:38.349
Look. Thawne did this to himself.

303
00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:43.312
And it's not like we can save him so...
it's time to let him go.

304
00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:48.526
Look. I know that we're the new kids
and we don't have the same history

305
00:17:48.609 --> 00:17:50.444
with Thawne. But that's a good thing

306
00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:54.240
because I don't care who Thawne is.
I care who you guys are.

307
00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:56.242
And you save people.

308
00:17:57.118 --> 00:17:58.703
I know because you saved me.

309
00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:00.871
And me. Literally.

310
00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.124
You're right. You are the new kids.

311
00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:06.252
And so when it comes to Thawne.
I'm sorry. but you don't get a say.

312
00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:09.005
Iris.

313
00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:11.966
Maybe we should think about this.

314
00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:13.009
We already have.

315
00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:16.554
You guys don't understand
what Thawne is capable of.

316
00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:20.182
It's time to keep everyone safe
by finally letting Thawne die.

317
00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:22.518
Barry. Iris.

318
00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:24.562
We need to talk.

319
00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:26.814
Now.

320
00:18:27.815 --> 00:18:28.649
Yeah.

321
00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:34.238
What the hell is wrong with you two?

322
00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:36.866
Since when do we let people die?

323
00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:38.451
Dad. you know who Thawne is.

324
00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:39.619
Yeah. I do.

325
00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:43.456
And that man came to you for help
which means you're obligated to try

326
00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:44.373
and save him.

327
00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:45.625
Joe. he killed you.

328
00:18:45.708 --> 00:18:47.918
No. I know you don't remember. but I do.

329
00:18:48.002 --> 00:18:50.713
If we don't let this happen now.
our family will never be safe.

330
00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:52.840
You don't think I want
to see him dead either?

331
00:18:53.382 --> 00:18:54.216
Because I do.

332
00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:57.136
If I learned one thing. being a cop

333
00:18:57.261 --> 00:18:59.930
is that you can't just protect
the people you think are good.

334
00:19:00.014 --> 00:19:01.932
You have to protect everyone.

335
00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:03.726
That's what heroes do.

336
00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:05.519
-I know that.
-Do you?

337
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:10.733
A hero is not just in the name. Barry.
or in a red suit.

338
00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:14.862
It's a choice that we make to decide
who and what we become.

339
00:19:15.738 --> 00:19:16.614
You know that.

340
00:19:16.697 --> 00:19:19.075
Dad. we don't have a choice.
Thawne isn't giving us one.

341
00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:21.410
You always have a choice!

342
00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:26.540
Now have either one of you

343
00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:30.670
even tried. to think
of a way to save him?

344
00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.299
You already found one.

345
00:19:38.344 --> 00:19:39.261
Yeah.

346
00:19:40.137 --> 00:19:42.723
We could save him
if we take his speed away.

347
00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:44.725
Permanently.

348
00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:46.936
Just like Jefferson Pierce did to you.

349
00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:50.314
-Listen. Joe. wait.
-Hey.

350
00:19:50.773 --> 00:19:51.607
Uh-uh.

351
00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:54.735
This decision is for the two of you.

352
00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:57.863
But I can tell you one thing.
If you let Thawne die.

353
00:19:57.947 --> 00:20:00.408
you don't have to worry
about him destroying our family.

354
00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:08.999
We have to talk to Caitlin.

355
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:11.627
Yeah.

356
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.260
The heroes
of this world have failed.

357
00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:22.513
But if they won't end
Thawne's existence.

358
00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:27.059
then I. Despero.
will take matters into my own hands.

359
00:20:29.353 --> 00:20:31.230
Mia Queen.

360
00:20:31.522 --> 00:20:33.482
Mia Queen...

361
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.069
Mia Queen.

362
00:20:37.653 --> 00:20:39.196
And you're gonna help me.

363
00:20:50.416 --> 00:20:51.667
Barry. are you sure?

364
00:20:53.377 --> 00:20:55.713
Yeah. Look. if we're really heroes.

365
00:20:55.796 --> 00:20:59.300
we can't turn our back on anyone.
including Thawne.

366
00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:01.802
So you want to take away his speed
to save his life?

367
00:21:03.637 --> 00:21:05.055
All right. What if it doesn't work?

368
00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:07.099
It will. Before the timeline reset.

369
00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:09.143
Jefferson hit me
with enough continuous voltage

370
00:21:09.226 --> 00:21:11.103
to nearly sever my connection
to the Speed Force.

371
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:12.354
Like blowing a fuse.

372
00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:14.273
And you want to do
the same thing to Thawne.

373
00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:17.860
And once his speed is gone.
A.R.G.U.S. will take him into custody.

374
00:21:18.152 --> 00:21:19.111
We've already called Cisco.

375
00:21:19.862 --> 00:21:22.156
Jail time won't make up
for all the lives he destroyed.

376
00:21:23.157 --> 00:21:27.453
Look. you're right. But we can't
let Thawne change who we are.

377
00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:32.124
You're a fool.

378
00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:35.377
Thawne must be erased from time itself.

379
00:21:35.461 --> 00:21:36.796
Why can't you see that?

380
00:21:36.879 --> 00:21:38.881
Despero. without his speed.

381
00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:40.841
Thawne won't be a threat
to anyone ever again.

382
00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:42.927
Thawne recovered his powers before.

383
00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:45.304
This is your final warning. Flash.

384
00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:49.350
Stand down and let Thawne die
or suffer the consequences.

385
00:21:52.102 --> 00:21:53.020
No.

386
00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:57.900
Barry!

387
00:21:59.777 --> 00:22:01.654
It's not too late. Flash!

388
00:22:02.071 --> 00:22:05.074
Let Thawne die. so Armageddon can end.

389
00:22:06.492 --> 00:22:07.993
Light up. Allegra.
we're going after Flash.

390
00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.162
No. Barry can handle Despero.

391
00:22:10.246 --> 00:22:12.081
You two protect Thawne. No matter what.

392
00:22:12.206 --> 00:22:13.582
- You sure. boss?
- Yeah.

393
00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:15.793
If Despero attacks us. too.
we need to be ready.

394
00:22:19.213 --> 00:22:20.381
What if Despero kills Barry?

395
00:22:20.464 --> 00:22:22.216
I mean. they've fought before
and it wasn't exactly close.

396
00:22:22.299 --> 00:22:23.717
Let's hope it goes better this time.

397
00:22:32.518 --> 00:22:35.271
I was right about you
all along. Flash.

398
00:22:35.688 --> 00:22:37.690
You are humanity's enemy.

399
00:22:38.691 --> 00:22:41.402
I'm choosing to save a life. Despero.
not end one.

400
00:22:42.903 --> 00:22:44.405
That's what heroes do.

401
00:22:46.532 --> 00:22:48.242
But you've never been a hero. have you?

402
00:22:48.325 --> 00:22:50.244
What are you implying?

403
00:22:51.954 --> 00:22:54.081
What you told me about your home-world.

404
00:22:54.665 --> 00:22:56.041
That was all a lie. wasn't it?

405
00:22:57.418 --> 00:23:01.839
You weren't the heroic rebel leader.
You were the despot.

406
00:23:02.798 --> 00:23:04.967
The one who inflicted
pain and suffering.

407
00:23:06.802 --> 00:23:09.263
who killed to get what he wanted.

408
00:23:09.346 --> 00:23:11.307
I did what was necessary.

409
00:23:11.432 --> 00:23:12.349
No. you're wrong.

410
00:23:13.392 --> 00:23:16.854
You've been wrong this whole time
about everything.

411
00:23:18.939 --> 00:23:20.441
You're no hero. Despero.

412
00:23:22.109 --> 00:23:23.235
You're just like Thawne.

413
00:23:23.319 --> 00:23:25.571
Only in your eyes. Flash.

414
00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:28.490
Because I know what must be done.

415
00:23:29.116 --> 00:23:34.121
The greater good that must be embraced
in order for this world to survive.

416
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:38.709
All that remains is for me to show you.

417
00:23:45.966 --> 00:23:47.593
Chester. secure S.T.A.R. Labs.

418
00:23:49.929 --> 00:23:51.513
Frak. we just lost power.

419
00:23:51.597 --> 00:23:52.723
What about Thawne?

420
00:23:53.223 --> 00:23:54.183
That's what's so weird.

421
00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:57.686
Backup system just kicked in.
but only for the force field trap.

422
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.855
What? No. no.
that doesn't make any sense unless--

423
00:23:59.939 --> 00:24:00.940
It's Despero.

424
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:02.107
We're under attack.

425
00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:19.166
Mia! What the hell. girl?

426
00:24:19.708 --> 00:24:22.086
Iris West-Allen.

427
00:24:23.712 --> 00:24:25.881
You and Flash made this decision.

428
00:24:26.966 --> 00:24:29.635
And now you'll die for making
the wrong one.

429
00:25:10.759 --> 00:25:11.719
Mia. listen to me.

430
00:25:12.261 --> 00:25:13.262
This isn't you.

431
00:25:14.638 --> 00:25:15.556
Mia.

432
00:25:17.266 --> 00:25:18.392
Mia. she's right.

433
00:25:18.809 --> 00:25:19.810
Take my power.

434
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.979
Take my strength. Fight him.

435
00:25:22.688 --> 00:25:23.814
Empath!

436
00:25:24.815 --> 00:25:28.235
You think I'd release
this perfect vessel?

437
00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:29.570
Mia. stop.

438
00:25:32.072 --> 00:25:33.198
I know you can fight this.

439
00:25:33.991 --> 00:25:36.910
The child is gone. human.

440
00:25:36.994 --> 00:25:37.995
No. she's not.

441
00:25:38.162 --> 00:25:40.205
Mia. I know you can fight this
because you already have.

442
00:25:40.622 --> 00:25:42.708
Look around.
You could have killed us but you didn't.

443
00:25:44.334 --> 00:25:46.795
Mia. she's right.

444
00:25:48.464 --> 00:25:49.423
Fight him.

445
00:25:55.054 --> 00:25:56.430
Impossible!

446
00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:06.523
Mia. think about William.

447
00:26:08.734 --> 00:26:10.861
Is this the path
that he would want you to choose?

448
00:26:26.043 --> 00:26:26.877
Iris.

449
00:26:28.712 --> 00:26:32.132
Allegra and Frost. in the hallway.

450
00:26:32.299 --> 00:26:33.425
I'll go check on them.

451
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:36.053
I'm so sorry.

452
00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.558
My pawn failed.

453
00:26:41.934 --> 00:26:43.352
Your friend survived.

454
00:26:43.644 --> 00:26:44.520
Mia?

455
00:26:46.313 --> 00:26:47.397
What did you do?

456
00:26:47.648 --> 00:26:50.109
Nothing compared
to what I'm going to do now.

457
00:26:50.567 --> 00:26:53.070
I told you Thawne must die and he will.

458
00:26:53.654 --> 00:26:56.281
That's why I'm taking matters
into my own hands.

459
00:26:56.365 --> 00:26:59.409
I'm going to be the hero
that this world needs. Flash.

460
00:27:00.994 --> 00:27:02.162
Not you!

461
00:27:05.624 --> 00:27:07.334
Barry. are you okay?

462
00:27:07.543 --> 00:27:08.919
Yeah. I think so.

463
00:27:09.503 --> 00:27:10.504
What's going on?

464
00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:12.589
I've got the secondary power circuits
up and running.

465
00:27:12.673 --> 00:27:15.050
but I'm picking up insane
energy readings out there.

466
00:27:15.134 --> 00:27:17.761
I'm talking like
atomic bomb level readings.

467
00:27:17.845 --> 00:27:18.720
It's Despero.

468
00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:21.723
He must be willing to wipe out
the whole city to get what he wants.

469
00:27:22.182 --> 00:27:23.308
He's going to kill us all.

470
00:27:23.892 --> 00:27:25.269
Just so Thawne will die.

471
00:27:45.873 --> 00:27:46.790
How's Mia?

472
00:27:46.874 --> 00:27:48.750
She's resting.
Frost is keeping an eye on her.

473
00:27:48.876 --> 00:27:50.544
Thank goodness Iris got through
to her before she--

474
00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:52.838
Right. But what in the world
are we supposed to do now?

475
00:27:53.005 --> 00:27:55.174
We beat Despero to the punch.

476
00:27:55.591 --> 00:27:57.509
We whammy Thawne's speed right now.

477
00:27:57.593 --> 00:28:00.262
make him a permanent jaywalker
before Despero whammies us.

478
00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.435
It's okay. Cecile.
We all decided it together.

479
00:28:07.394 --> 00:28:08.645
Chester. where are we with--

480
00:28:08.729 --> 00:28:11.648
Project Whammy? I still have to finish
calibrating your suit.

481
00:28:11.732 --> 00:28:14.026
Well. how much time do we have
before the timeline resets?

482
00:28:14.109 --> 00:28:15.777
A few minutes. maybe less.

483
00:28:15.944 --> 00:28:17.821
And only if Despero
doesn't wipe us out first.

484
00:28:21.116 --> 00:28:23.243
Look. we're not losing today.

485
00:28:23.827 --> 00:28:25.787
Not our city. Not a single life.

486
00:28:26.038 --> 00:28:27.706
I don't know how.
but there's got to be a way

487
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:29.791
to stop Despero long enough
for Chuck to do his thing.

488
00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:31.919
So come on. we're team Flash.

489
00:28:32.544 --> 00:28:33.420
What can we do?

490
00:28:34.588 --> 00:28:37.341
The energy Despero's harnessing
is from his home world. Kalanor.

491
00:28:38.091 --> 00:28:40.344
But. I mean. even if
the energy is alien.

492
00:28:40.427 --> 00:28:43.013
the Flame of Py'tar is still a flame.

493
00:28:43.263 --> 00:28:45.390
You can harness it with a vacuum.

494
00:28:45.474 --> 00:28:46.558
And then disperse it.

495
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:50.562
But I'd still need a way to direct
all that energy into the atmosphere.

496
00:28:50.854 --> 00:28:53.023
Wait. If a delivery system
is what you need.

497
00:28:53.106 --> 00:28:54.274
then I got the ticket.

498
00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:56.610
Okay. so you know how
the P.E.D. redirects energy?

499
00:28:56.944 --> 00:29:01.114
Turns out the materials in that puppy
are damn versatile.

500
00:29:02.282 --> 00:29:07.329
So I took the liberty of using them
to make these.

501
00:29:08.956 --> 00:29:12.960
No way. Chuck. you're amazing.

502
00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:15.045
Yeah. I can work with these.

503
00:29:33.063 --> 00:29:34.564
They're a perfect fit. Chester.

504
00:29:35.065 --> 00:29:37.609
Thanks. Now run. boss. Run.

505
00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.741
Now. Flash. your city dies

506
00:29:45.534 --> 00:29:48.328
so that this planet's future
may survive.

507
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:24.114
No!

508
00:30:42.007 --> 00:30:43.091
It's gone.

509
00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.928
my connection to the flame.

510
00:30:49.139 --> 00:30:50.474
Damn you. Flash.

511
00:30:50.932 --> 00:30:52.059
It's over. Despero.

512
00:30:55.354 --> 00:30:58.398
Flash. you've no idea what you've done.

513
00:30:59.358 --> 00:31:03.070
I swear by the moons of Kalanor.
you'll pay for this.

514
00:31:04.946 --> 00:31:06.406
This whole planet will.

515
00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:12.537
Flash. we've got
less than 30 seconds to save Thawne

516
00:31:12.621 --> 00:31:13.997
before the timeline resets.

517
00:31:14.081 --> 00:31:15.665
All right. Get ready. Chester.
I'm on my way.

518
00:31:21.546 --> 00:31:23.256
My speed.

519
00:31:25.425 --> 00:31:26.927
I need more time.

520
00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:28.428
We're out of time. Thawne.

521
00:31:29.888 --> 00:31:30.889
Calibration complete.

522
00:31:31.306 --> 00:31:32.182
Go for it.

523
00:31:32.265 --> 00:31:33.683
On my mark. lower the shield.

524
00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:40.232
Now.

525
00:32:03.463 --> 00:32:06.758
There is no trace of the Negative
Speed Force left in your body.

526
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:09.761
Barry. you did it.

527
00:32:12.305 --> 00:32:16.184
What exactly do you think you've done?

528
00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:18.103
We just saved your life. Thawne.

529
00:32:19.312 --> 00:32:20.480
Don't make us regret it.

530
00:32:23.942 --> 00:32:25.235
You think you saved my life?

531
00:32:26.695 --> 00:32:28.071
You took my speed.

532
00:32:28.697 --> 00:32:30.240
My speed is my life.

533
00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:32.117
You took my life!

534
00:32:35.036 --> 00:32:36.496
And left me in hell.

535
00:32:53.346 --> 00:32:56.266
Now this is epic. Epic.

536
00:32:56.808 --> 00:32:57.642
Wow!

537
00:32:57.851 --> 00:33:00.854
I don't know what's more impressive.
this place or us.

538
00:33:00.937 --> 00:33:01.980
Us. Definitely.

539
00:33:02.439 --> 00:33:05.066
I haven't been to a place this swank
since my debutante days.

540
00:33:05.192 --> 00:33:06.985
Well. we've got the place
to ourselves tonight.

541
00:33:07.068 --> 00:33:10.030
And since Thawne's at A.R.G.U.S.
and Despero is finally gone--

542
00:33:10.155 --> 00:33:11.198
For good. it seems like.

543
00:33:11.281 --> 00:33:12.699
I figured we deserved a night off.

544
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.578
Look. about me going evil
and trying to kill you all. I--

545
00:33:16.661 --> 00:33:17.787
Already forgiven.

546
00:33:18.038 --> 00:33:20.040
We're just glad to have
the real Mia back.

547
00:33:20.373 --> 00:33:23.710
And that. beautiful people.
is it for shop talk.

548
00:33:23.793 --> 00:33:24.711
Yes. absolutely.

549
00:33:24.794 --> 00:33:26.755
I think we've had enough of aliens
and evil speedsters.

550
00:33:28.173 --> 00:33:30.175
Does that go for evil magicians. too?

551
00:33:32.344 --> 00:33:34.888
I know what you did
to Laurel Lance. Damien Darhk.

552
00:33:35.847 --> 00:33:37.307
How about I return the favor?

553
00:33:38.141 --> 00:33:40.060
By all means. go for it.

554
00:33:41.186 --> 00:33:43.104
I thought I'd be
a dead man by now. anyway.

555
00:33:47.609 --> 00:33:48.693
I need a drink.

556
00:33:50.362 --> 00:33:51.363
A real one.

557
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.701
Damien. I'm sorry.

558
00:33:57.077 --> 00:33:58.036
Me. too.

559
00:33:59.496 --> 00:34:02.040
And now the timeline's reset.
I should be gone.

560
00:34:04.292 --> 00:34:05.710
Damien. I don't know what to say.

561
00:34:08.588 --> 00:34:09.631
You just did.

562
00:34:18.348 --> 00:34:20.267
That aroma seems familiar.

563
00:34:21.935 --> 00:34:22.894
Sebastian James?

564
00:34:23.645 --> 00:34:24.604
My favorite Scotch.

565
00:34:27.107 --> 00:34:30.360
Did you guys always party this hard
after a successful mission?

566
00:34:33.238 --> 00:34:34.072
I wish.

567
00:34:35.323 --> 00:34:36.408
By the way. I...

568
00:34:36.658 --> 00:34:38.743
I came across something
that might help you find William.

569
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:41.288
The symbol on the Hozen?

570
00:34:42.122 --> 00:34:46.209
It matches a symbol from some
heavily redacted documents from Berlin.

571
00:34:46.293 --> 00:34:51.506
Only my source couldn't find out more.
thanks to some very intense firewalls.

572
00:34:52.632 --> 00:34:55.510
You know. I think I know a hacker
who might be able to help me.

573
00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:57.679
You're going to see Felicity?

574
00:34:59.389 --> 00:35:00.890
You were right. Iris.

575
00:35:01.725 --> 00:35:04.686
I can be the person
she always wanted me to be.

576
00:35:06.646 --> 00:35:09.107
Thank you for helping me
find myself again.

577
00:35:10.233 --> 00:35:12.319
You made the choice to be a hero.

578
00:35:14.279 --> 00:35:15.322
Your dad would be proud.

579
00:35:16.489 --> 00:35:20.160
And hey. you know. don't be a stranger
while you're here in our time.

580
00:35:21.328 --> 00:35:24.372
Bart and Nora. they drop in on us a lot.

581
00:35:25.999 --> 00:35:27.792
And I think you guys
would get along really well.

582
00:35:28.835 --> 00:35:30.587
Anyways. cheers.

583
00:35:30.754 --> 00:35:31.630
Cheers.

584
00:35:42.015 --> 00:35:43.058
I know that look.

585
00:35:44.934 --> 00:35:47.354
Someone's got a crush.

586
00:35:47.937 --> 00:35:51.316
No. No. me and Allegra are just...

587
00:35:51.441 --> 00:35:52.275
we're just friends.

588
00:35:52.359 --> 00:35:53.943
-Sure? Sure.
-Yeah. Yeah.

589
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:57.405
But you could be a lot more if you
decided to stop sipping root beer.

590
00:35:57.489 --> 00:35:59.199
and go put a move on her.

591
00:36:00.492 --> 00:36:02.535
I'm a lot more intuitive
than people give me credit for.

592
00:36:03.536 --> 00:36:05.121
Come on. go for it.

593
00:36:07.248 --> 00:36:08.458
-Okay.
-You look great.

594
00:36:09.793 --> 00:36:11.086
Move. Moves. moves.

595
00:36:12.337 --> 00:36:13.838
Put the moves. moves. moves.

596
00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:16.508
-Hey. Allegra.
-Hi.

597
00:36:16.633 --> 00:36:19.094
You look... wow...

598
00:36:20.804 --> 00:36:22.013
Thanks. Chuck.

599
00:36:22.389 --> 00:36:23.598
Not bad yourself.

600
00:36:23.682 --> 00:36:24.641
Thank you.

601
00:36:24.724 --> 00:36:26.226
Hey. I don't know what's up
with you two--

602
00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:28.311
-What? We're just standing here.
-What are you--

603
00:36:28.395 --> 00:36:29.521
Like normal people.

604
00:36:29.771 --> 00:36:31.856
-Normal.
-Both of us. man.

605
00:36:32.399 --> 00:36:34.776
I just mean how you called me out
about Thawne earlier.

606
00:36:35.151 --> 00:36:36.528
Oh! That.

607
00:36:36.986 --> 00:36:38.530
I don't know what got into me.

608
00:36:38.613 --> 00:36:40.407
No. I mean. you guys were right.

609
00:36:40.824 --> 00:36:42.033
That's what I needed to hear.

610
00:36:42.242 --> 00:36:43.618
So I just wanted to say thanks.

611
00:36:44.369 --> 00:36:45.662
-Cool. Yeah.
-Yeah.

612
00:36:45.787 --> 00:36:47.664
- Thanks. I mean. you're welcome.
- Yeah.

613
00:36:49.541 --> 00:36:50.375
Have a good night.

614
00:36:53.586 --> 00:36:54.963
-Anyway. cheers.
-Cheers.

615
00:36:58.883 --> 00:36:59.926
Damien Darhk?

616
00:37:01.511 --> 00:37:02.846
You're here to arrest me?

617
00:37:03.763 --> 00:37:05.014
I'm not a cop anymore.

618
00:37:05.724 --> 00:37:08.935
I came to say thank you.

619
00:37:09.936 --> 00:37:12.522
You helping Barry restore the timeline.

620
00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:14.899
that's pretty damn selfless.

621
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:16.818
Well. what can I say?

622
00:37:19.154 --> 00:37:20.405
Being a parent kinda...

623
00:37:22.282 --> 00:37:23.324
changes you.

624
00:37:23.575 --> 00:37:24.409
Mm-hmm.

625
00:37:24.534 --> 00:37:25.493
For the better.

626
00:37:31.416 --> 00:37:32.292
Agreed.

627
00:37:34.794 --> 00:37:37.046
Yeah. I wish I knew why
I was still here.

628
00:37:38.882 --> 00:37:40.216
I should be gone by now. Joe.

629
00:37:41.384 --> 00:37:42.761
Nora should be in my place.

630
00:37:43.636 --> 00:37:46.931
Well. maybe.
you've still got a little work to do.

631
00:37:52.187 --> 00:37:54.481
Are you trying to cast a spell?

632
00:37:56.065 --> 00:37:57.192
More like a prayer.

633
00:37:59.652 --> 00:38:01.446
Maybe this is my unfinished business.

634
00:38:06.659 --> 00:38:07.494
What is it?

635
00:38:07.827 --> 00:38:08.745
It's a gift.

636
00:38:10.121 --> 00:38:11.122
Father to father.

637
00:38:12.749 --> 00:38:14.542
I think you're
going to need that someday.

638
00:38:15.627 --> 00:38:16.461
What--

639
00:38:20.423 --> 00:38:21.299
West?

640
00:38:23.343 --> 00:38:24.177
West?

641
00:38:30.183 --> 00:38:31.017
Huh...

642
00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.479
Dad?

643
00:38:39.526 --> 00:38:40.485
Nora.

644
00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:42.320
It's really you.

645
00:38:42.946 --> 00:38:44.030
Where are we?

646
00:38:45.281 --> 00:38:46.199
It doesn't matter.

647
00:38:47.784 --> 00:38:49.869
I'm just glad I got to see you
before I go.

648
00:38:52.664 --> 00:38:53.498
What do you mean?

649
00:38:55.208 --> 00:38:56.042
I don't understand.

650
00:38:56.125 --> 00:38:58.211
You're leaving? I thought you were--

651
00:38:58.419 --> 00:38:59.254
Dead?

652
00:39:00.713 --> 00:39:01.631
I will be.

653
00:39:03.299 --> 00:39:05.343
I guess I just needed
a little more time.

654
00:39:05.969 --> 00:39:06.886
Wait.

655
00:39:08.429 --> 00:39:10.098
Dad. please.
I don't know what's happening.

656
00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:12.267
but you can't leave now.
I just got you back.

657
00:39:13.226 --> 00:39:14.435
I love you. Nora-doll.

658
00:39:18.398 --> 00:39:20.692
When was the last time
we had a night out again?

659
00:39:20.775 --> 00:39:22.485
I don't know. It's been too long.

660
00:39:24.404 --> 00:39:25.780
Is that Nora Darhk?

661
00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:29.200
Barry Allen?

662
00:39:31.244 --> 00:39:32.078
Iris?

663
00:39:33.705 --> 00:39:35.832
What am I doing here?
What just happened?

664
00:39:35.915 --> 00:39:37.208
Where is my dad?

665
00:39:39.919 --> 00:39:40.795
Barry.

666
00:39:44.757 --> 00:39:47.427
Please. someone tell me
what is going on?

667
00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:49.178
You're okay.

668
00:39:49.679 --> 00:39:50.889
Thanks to your dad.

669
00:39:56.769 --> 00:39:57.896
He's gone. isn't he?

670
00:40:03.151 --> 00:40:04.611
Why is this happening again?

671
00:40:05.737 --> 00:40:07.822
Because Damien Darhk promised

672
00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:10.950
that he would do whatever it takes
to save his daughter.

673
00:40:11.993 --> 00:40:13.077
And he did.

674
00:40:14.996 --> 00:40:15.997
Come on.

675
00:40:17.206 --> 00:40:18.708
There's a story I need you to hear.

676
00:40:41.981 --> 00:40:43.149
Sorry. I've never done that.

677
00:40:46.027 --> 00:40:50.823
So. a lot has happened
these past few days.

678
00:40:51.157 --> 00:40:53.368
The world almost didn't make it.

679
00:40:54.494 --> 00:40:55.411
but it did.

680
00:40:56.996 --> 00:40:59.999
Thanks to all of you
and a dedicated father.

681
00:41:00.792 --> 00:41:05.630
We all survived because
when faced with the very worst.

682
00:41:06.255 --> 00:41:08.216
it's our choices that define us.

683
00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:14.138
And the choices that we made
are why we're all heroes.

684
00:41:16.474 --> 00:41:20.186
So. to making our own destiny.

685
00:41:21.229 --> 00:41:22.271
and protecting it.

686
00:41:24.273 --> 00:41:25.149
together.

687
00:41:25.233 --> 00:41:26.067
Together.

688
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:27.110
- Cheers!
- Cheers to that.

689
00:41:40.081 --> 00:41:41.040
Thank God.

690
00:41:41.582 --> 00:41:43.459
Now everything can go back to normal.

691
00:41:43.483 --> 00:41:51.483
