﻿1
00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:04.046
Injustice?

2
00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:07.633
Damn.

3
00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:12.346
Look. Barry. those protocols
are a one-way trip. and a bad one.

4
00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:13.722
-I know that.
-All right.

5
00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:15.474
All right.

6
00:00:16.517 --> 00:00:19.228
Just take a deep breath.

7
00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:21.313
Tell me what happened.

8
00:00:22.648 --> 00:00:26.735
In the last 24 hours.
I've lost my job. my home base.

9
00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.197
I started having blackouts.

10
00:00:32.074 --> 00:00:33.825
I destroyed my apartment at super speed.

11
00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:36.245
I attacked my team. my family.

12
00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.789
Jefferson. I attacked innocent people.
Dozens of them.

13
00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.291
And I don't remember doing it.
I'm out of control!

14
00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:42.417
Easy.

15
00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:46.505
In my experience. there's almost
nothing that can't be undone.

16
00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:48.215
But I'm gonna need you
to calm down for a minute.

17
00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:49.841
Calm down? I'm losing my mind.

18
00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:53.387
Look. you know the contingency plan.

19
00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:56.807
The Injustice Protocols were put
into place for a reason.

20
00:00:57.683 --> 00:00:59.768
To protect the world
when one of us goes rogue.

21
00:01:00.686 --> 00:01:02.229
It's happening. Jefferson.

22
00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:05.023
You have to take away my powers.

23
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.972
-We need to call in the others.
-We don't have time.

24
00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:38.849
No. Kara. J'onn. Sara.

25
00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:41.602
We all designed this plan together
after Faust.

26
00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:43.061
We all made the same promise!

27
00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:46.898
If anyone ever lost control.
a designated teammate would step in.

28
00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:48.150
For me. that's you.

29
00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:49.943
And I don't carry that weight lightly.

30
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:55.240
What if this is all temporary?
What if your mind starts healing?

31
00:01:55.324 --> 00:01:57.159
It's not going to heal.
It's only gonna get worse.

32
00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:58.577
How can you say that for sure?

33
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.750
I forgot Joe died.

34
00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:09.087
The man who raised me.

35
00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:15.344
He passed away six months ago
and I can't remember it... at all.

36
00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:20.432
Look. I know you have questions.

37
00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:22.059
but I'm losing myself.

38
00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:24.019
You took an oath.

39
00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:27.481
If I ever said the word "injustice."
you'd listen.

40
00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:32.778
Please... we have to do this now.

41
00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:41.495
My father had a saying.

42
00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:44.998
One that I even teach my students today.

43
00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:48.293
"Where's the future? Right here.

44
00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:50.671
Whose life is this? Mine.

45
00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:54.049
And what are you going do with it?
Live it. by any means necessary."

46
00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:56.176
So don't worry. I will honor my promise.

47
00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:58.970
I will do whatever is necessary
to keep folks alive.

48
00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:01.056
But remember...

49
00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:06.186
when we take away your powers.
they are gone...

50
00:03:07.396 --> 00:03:08.355
permanently.

51
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.907
It's happening again.

52
00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:22.285
Another world lost.

53
00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:24.913
Another failure.

54
00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.166
Armageddon waits for no man.

55
00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:38.051
And it won't wait
for me to find you. Flash.

56
00:03:39.845 --> 00:03:41.888
You think Despero was right.

57
00:03:41.972 --> 00:03:44.182
that Barry's gonna destroy
the world or something?

58
00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:47.769
No. Hey. what Barry did today was scary.

59
00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.731
And the things that he said.
they really. really hurt.

60
00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:54.609
But someone that we love
is going through a mental health crisis.

61
00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:59.322
so I don't care what he may
or may not do ten years from now.

62
00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:04.870
We need to take care of him today.
just like he did for me.

63
00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:08.874
Okay. we'll follow your lead.
What do you want to do?

64
00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:12.461
Okay. I've been sensing Despero all day.

65
00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:15.172
He's using his mind's eye
to scan the city.

66
00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:18.216
Now. he hasn't found him yet.
but if Barry's not thinking clearly--

67
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.469
What if he's the only one
thinking clearly?

68
00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:23.096
Boss. what are you talking about?

69
00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:26.725
Look. I know how this is gonna sound.
but when Despero showed up.

70
00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:29.227
he said that Barry would suffer tragedy.

71
00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:31.396
And then on cue. he lost his job.

72
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.148
he lost S.T.A.R. Labs. and now...

73
00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:34.816
he's lost his mind.

74
00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:37.527
Doesn't that seem like
a big coincidence?

75
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.488
A little too big?

76
00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:43.074
But Despero's from the future.
Wouldn't he know what happened?

77
00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:46.578
But what if he didn't know that
someone secretly caused it to happen?

78
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.205
You think he's being framed?

79
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.206
Iris.

80
00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:52.042
He forgot about Joe.

81
00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:54.169
Nobody was framing him then.

82
00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:56.546
Yeah. I'm not so sure.

83
00:04:57.422 --> 00:05:01.927
Look. when Dad died. C.C.P.D said
that his death was an accident.

84
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:05.889
that he fell on the tracks
at Scott Railway.

85
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.225
Kramer left me with the evidence.

86
00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:11.812
but for the last six months.
I haven't been able to look at it.

87
00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.397
But then I thought about
what Barry said.

88
00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:17.692
that we have to investigate
what happened.

89
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.655
So I finally started looking...

90
00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:23.156
...and this is what I found.

91
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.282
Joe.

92
00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:26.618
Why are you showing us this?

93
00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:28.453
Just trust me.

94
00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:36.086
See. one second he's there
and the next. he's gone.

95
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.589
I haven't figured this all out yet.
but if somebody framed Barry.

96
00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:45.512
then he doesn't cause Armageddon.
and. Cecile. Dad could be alive.

97
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.140
No. no. it's impossible.

98
00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:50.058
Is it?

99
00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:53.895
I mean. what if a meta-human
abducted him at the last second

100
00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.356
or he got swapped
with like. a Mirror clone?

101
00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:59.359
I saw them bury his body.

102
00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:02.779
So did Barry. and so did you.

103
00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:05.323
Okay. guys. how about we take five?

104
00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:06.658
I'm not trying to upset you.

105
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:08.910
Then what are you trying to do?

106
00:06:08.994 --> 00:06:12.163
I'm trying to find out
if my dad is still alive.

107
00:06:12.247 --> 00:06:14.165
I'm trying to prove
my husband's innocence.

108
00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:17.419
It does not matter if he is innocent.
if we can't find him.

109
00:06:17.586 --> 00:06:19.504
which is what we have been trying to do

110
00:06:19.588 --> 00:06:22.048
while you have been living
in a fantasy world.

111
00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:23.091
Hey.

112
00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:27.846
Iris has trusted Barry
against the odds before.

113
00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:32.976
like. when Bloodwork infected him
and she was right.

114
00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:36.146
If there's even a chance
that this could be real.

115
00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:41.026
I can't give up
and you wouldn't want me to.

116
00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:43.320
Is that what you think?
You think I gave up?

117
00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:46.823
My God. do you think I don't wake up

118
00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:50.285
alone every morning in our bed.

119
00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:54.205
praying to God that all of this
was nothing but a bad dream?

120
00:06:55.707 --> 00:06:58.752
Iris. I have done everything that I can

121
00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:03.423
to just keep moving forward
since I lost Joe.

122
00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.467
I did it so that
I could be there for you.

123
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.302
and for Jenna. for this team.

124
00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:10.764
And you come in here and you want
to shove his death in my face?

125
00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.767
He was the father of my child!

126
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.477
And my father!

127
00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:25.278
Fine.

128
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.533
If you insist on pursuing this lie.
then we will save Barry without you.

129
00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:38.833
Fine... You save him your way.
I'll save him mine.

130
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.190
Okay. Cecile. What do you want to do?

131
00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:06.653
We find Barry before Despero does first.

132
00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:09.322
No matter what it takes.

133
00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:17.789
How are we
supposed to find Barry now?

134
00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:21.084
Okay. This is gonna sound wild.

135
00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:24.462
but Despero's scanning the whole world
for Barry's brainwaves. right?

136
00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:26.548
Like a needle in a haystack.

137
00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:29.801
I know him better than almost anyone.

138
00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:33.388
So you should be able to pinpoint
Barry's mind faster than he can.

139
00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:37.934
Only Despero's psychic radius
is exponentially higher than yours.

140
00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:43.189
Alex Danvers says he gets a power boost
from his power source of...

141
00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:44.941
...Flame of Py'tar.

142
00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:48.486
Okay. I just need
a boost of my own. right?

143
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.988
So you can build something.

144
00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:52.490
something that can amplify
my psychic powers.

145
00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:57.245
You want me to build a Cerebro
out of the trash in my garage?

146
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.336
Oh. frack. yeah. I can do that.

147
00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.005
Okay. There's still one problem.

148
00:09:07.338 --> 00:09:10.425
Kalanorians like Despero
have four hemispheres to their brain.

149
00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:12.010
The human brain only has two.

150
00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:14.804
So even if we amplify
your empathic radius.

151
00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.765
you'd still be at a disadvantage.

152
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.726
Then we're gonna need
some more brain power...

153
00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:23.438
and I know just who to call.

154
00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:28.568
So. things got
a little intense back there. You okay?

155
00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:31.112
Yeah. Look.
I don't want to hurt Cecile.

156
00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:33.698
but if someone's framing Barry
and my dad might be okay.

157
00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:35.784
then I have to figure out the truth.

158
00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:38.536
I'm just glad
I don't have to do it alone.

159
00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:40.997
Team Citizen forever. boss.

160
00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:46.628
So what are we looking for?
Signs of a meta-abduction?

161
00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:52.425
What the hell?

162
00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:54.469
What is it?

163
00:09:58.348 --> 00:09:59.766
I'm not sure. Do you see anything?

164
00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:10.652
No. I'm not picking up anything
on the electro-magnetic spectrum.

165
00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:13.780
but your time sickness
makes you see stuff sometimes. right?

166
00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:14.948
Could it be acting up?

167
00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:15.907
Must be.

168
00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:17.784
Deon's treatments are probably
wearing off.

169
00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:18.993
I'm supposed to see him tonight.

170
00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:22.122
You know what I did see?

171
00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:26.835
The fiber optic aura for these cameras
leads to a security booth inside.

172
00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:30.296
So if someone wanted to alter
the footage of Joe's accident.

173
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.548
to make it seem like he died--

174
00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.049
That'd be where they'd start.

175
00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.262
I'll never forget that day.

176
00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:40.014
People were screaming. "Someone fell."

177
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.809
I tried calling the emergency line.
but it was too late.

178
00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:44.435
What about before it happened?

179
00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:46.437
Did you see anyone suspicious
on the platform?

180
00:10:46.938 --> 00:10:48.857
It was pretty empty when Mr. West died.

181
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.401
The Red Line came in 15 minutes early.

182
00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:53.862
Hang on.

183
00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:55.905
Iris West-Allen.

184
00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:57.866
Were you his daughter?

185
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:58.950
I still am.

186
00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:03.621
What about after?

187
00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:07.876
Was there anyone there who had access
to the scene before C.C.P.D. arrived?

188
00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:09.627
Ma'am...

189
00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:12.130
your father took a bad step.

190
00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:13.882
It happens sometimes.

191
00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:15.800
Well. the reason I'm asking is because

192
00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:17.760
the video files that you sent over
to C.C.P.D.

193
00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:20.430
were missing some very important frames
from the moment of incident.

194
00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:22.807
That doesn't just happen.

195
00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:25.059
unless you're saying
someone got into your system.

196
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.062
Or because we're on the same power grid
as Sharks Stadium.

197
00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:31.274
Whenever there's a game.
like there was that day.

198
00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:34.527
our automatic CCTV upload
gets interrupted

199
00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:36.446
and we end up losing chunks of data.

200
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.240
It's a good thing
we back up our files locally.

201
00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:50.251
-Is this the only angle?
-No. it's okay.

202
00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:53.922
I was wrong. It was just an accident.

203
00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:14.108
So. who wants next game. boys?

204
00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:17.237
Think you can end up on top?

205
00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:20.531
I think you're done for today.

206
00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:30.458
Horton. I'm surprised you showed.

207
00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:34.754
Figured you'd still be crying
over your boyfriend somewhere.

208
00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:38.258
You should have heard the cheers at
Iron Heights when that news broke out.

209
00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:41.469
Well. that's funny. because I figured

210
00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:45.932
you'd already be running
Scudder's entire criminal enterprise.

211
00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:49.560
not hustling morons in a dive bar.

212
00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:52.772
I guess you probably shouldn't
have sold them out after all.

213
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:54.774
Fine.

214
00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:55.900
Aw.

215
00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:58.152
That means you're available.

216
00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:02.865
For what? Got a job for me.
Ms. Meta-Attorney?

217
00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:06.160
Look. I need help.

218
00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:09.706
Psychic help.
Someone that I care about is missing.

219
00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:14.460
Let me guess. He runs real fast.

220
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.879
It's all over the news.

221
00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:20.800
Flash went bad.
It's the feel-good story of the year.

222
00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:25.930
And even if I did want to help
return the scarlet speedster

223
00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:27.432
to the side of angels.

224
00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:31.019
during our last go-around.
you messed with my head.

225
00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:35.356
I don't know if I can trust you.

226
00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:39.861
Can you trust me to help
get your parole restrictions lifted?

227
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.656
Quid pro quo. huh?

228
00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:50.580
When do we start?

229
00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:04.510
Damn it. I can't get this last conduit.

230
00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:11.601
You know what? Sometimes.
I like to work with a little music on.

231
00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:15.188
Yeah.

232
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.947
Monk?

233
00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:28.284
Okay. trying to impress me.

234
00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:31.704
I kind of grew up on this stuff.

235
00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:36.250
Joe always had something
spinning on the turntable.

236
00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:39.212
Miles Davis. Johnny Hartman.
Ella Fitzgerald...

237
00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:40.755
It's his favorite.

238
00:14:44.425 --> 00:14:45.551
Was his favorite.

239
00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:54.602
Yeah. I lost someone. too. a while back.

240
00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:58.022
Bill Henderson.

241
00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:01.317
Actually. he was a cop.
like your old man.

242
00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:03.569
We had our ups and downs.

243
00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:09.117
but... through it all.
he was my best friend... brother.

244
00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.041
Bill died saving my life...

245
00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:21.963
so I could get home
to Lynn and the girls.

246
00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:26.843
Yeah. he made that sacrifice...

247
00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:34.183
just like you sacrificing
a big part of yourself here today.

248
00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:38.479
You know. if Joe was here.

249
00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:41.983
I think he'd be real proud
of the hero you've been...

250
00:15:42.733 --> 00:15:43.568
all along.

251
00:15:45.027 --> 00:15:46.821
It's been you all along. Flash.

252
00:15:53.494 --> 00:15:56.289
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. that was the last conduit.

253
00:15:57.582 --> 00:16:02.044
Now. when your suit materializes. you'll
be able to generate enough voltage

254
00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:03.838
to disrupt my Speed Force connection.

255
00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:08.885
All right. Giving Gambi
a run for his money. huh?

256
00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:10.720
Well. all right.

257
00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:13.556
Let's go blow this fuse.

258
00:16:29.363 --> 00:16:30.990
I'm ready.

259
00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:34.994
This is gonna hurt.

260
00:16:36.537 --> 00:16:37.413
Mm-hmm.

261
00:16:37.437 --> 00:16:45.437
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

262
00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:13.074
Boss. you gotta see this.

263
00:17:13.824 --> 00:17:16.327
Okay. do you remember
what the security chief said.

264
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.539
that the day Joe died.
the Red Line was running early?

265
00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:22.208
Well. back in my car-thief days.

266
00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:24.502
I'd take the Red Line home
from the chop shop.

267
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:28.005
and it was never early.
It was always late.

268
00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:31.217
So. my dad was just unlucky?

269
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.427
Well. that's an understatement.

270
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:39.016
The train that hit Joe passed a routine
inspection two days before the accident.

271
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.018
Yet. somehow the hydraulics failed?

272
00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:46.065
Iris. there are dozens and dozens
of coincidences like this.

273
00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:49.026
Do you know what the odds are
that they all happened at once?

274
00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:50.403
A million-to-one.

275
00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:52.780
The events that led to Joe's accident.

276
00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:54.740
they line up perfectly.

277
00:17:55.783 --> 00:17:56.784
Too perfectly.

278
00:17:57.159 --> 00:17:58.077
So. what are you saying?

279
00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.706
That you're right.
That someone was pulling the strings.

280
00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:03.541
Barry's not crazy. And your dad--

281
00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:04.875
Look. Allegra. I was wrong...

282
00:18:06.794 --> 00:18:08.129
about everything.

283
00:18:10.464 --> 00:18:12.675
These last six months have been
the worst six months of my life.

284
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.976
Look. I get it.

285
00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:24.061
I do.

286
00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:26.480
When Esperanza died...

287
00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:30.735
I lost hope. too.

288
00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:36.824
but... what saved me from the darkness

289
00:18:36.907 --> 00:18:40.036
was remembering the words of a hero.

290
00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:43.789
"As long as we keep the loved ones
we've lost in our hearts.

291
00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:46.667
there's always hope."

292
00:18:57.762 --> 00:18:58.804
Are you seeing this?

293
00:18:59.096 --> 00:19:00.306
Seeing what?

294
00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:04.477
I have to get back to the station.

295
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.771
-I thought that was a dead end.
-It's not.

296
00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:08.981
We just couldn't see all the evidence.

297
00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:16.280
Ladies. may I present the solution
to all of our Flash-finding problems.

298
00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:18.115
the Neural Conjoiner.

299
00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:19.825
Both of you have the natural ability

300
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:21.952
to access brainwaves like an antenna.

301
00:19:22.036 --> 00:19:23.120
Cecile is an empath.

302
00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:27.625
and Rosa is a psychic who can spin
people's emotions out of control.

303
00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:29.835
So with the telepathic crown
as an amplifier.

304
00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:32.129
we'll be able to conjoin
your psychic powers

305
00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:33.964
and pick up way more brainwaves
than you'd ever be able

306
00:19:34.048 --> 00:19:37.134
to pick up on your own.
like. all over the continent.

307
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.346
Now. all you need to do
is focus on the Flash's brainwaves.

308
00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:42.181
and the N.C. will transmit them here.

309
00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:47.103
while I use the visual data
to triangulate his location with this.

310
00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:50.981
I'm sorry. but does that TV
have rabbit ears on it?

311
00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:56.237
Yeah. Because it's my grandma's.

312
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.114
which means
we'll have to be done by 7:00.

313
00:19:58.197 --> 00:19:59.657
because she doesn't
want to miss her stories.

314
00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:06.247
You ready?

315
00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:31.564
It's too much.
It's too much! It's too much! I can't!

316
00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:33.983
-Chuck. turn it off.
-No. We can do this.

317
00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:40.156
So many minds to reach and touch.

318
00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:43.325
can't. I can't.

319
00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:48.622
-It's too many. I can't do this.
-No. there aren't.

320
00:20:50.833 --> 00:20:52.668
Horton. listen to me.

321
00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:55.921
Together. we are strong enough
to handle this.

322
00:20:56.422 --> 00:21:00.468
but you're letting your own feelings
hold you back. Now. focus!

323
00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:06.599
Horton! You're letting
your own emotions bring you down.

324
00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:09.560
That sadness you got. get over it.

325
00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:11.771
-You want to find your hero?
-Yes.

326
00:21:11.854 --> 00:21:13.606
Then. lose the weakness.

327
00:21:13.689 --> 00:21:16.358
just like I lost those gushy feelings
for Scudder.

328
00:21:16.442 --> 00:21:20.070
Forget about your grief.
your quilt. your sadness.

329
00:21:20.154 --> 00:21:23.783
Forget about your damn dead boyfriend.
Bury it!

330
00:21:43.761 --> 00:21:45.304
/ still have
some of my speed.

331
00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:47.014
The connections not fully severed.

332
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.018
I found him.

333
00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:54.563
Keep it going. Keep it going.

334
00:21:54.772 --> 00:21:56.106
We almost have a clear signal.

335
00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:04.156
-What happened?
-You overloaded the crown.

336
00:22:05.783 --> 00:22:08.369
Damn. Horton. I knew I was good. but...

337
00:22:09.286 --> 00:22:10.329
color me impressed.

338
00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:16.168
Okay. if the amplifier's busted. then
maybe we should try a different way.

339
00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:19.171
No. Chester. you can fix it. right?
You can fix it.

340
00:22:19.505 --> 00:22:22.007
Well. I need about an hour
to recalibrate.

341
00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:23.384
but then. we should be good to go.

342
00:22:23.467 --> 00:22:26.679
Do it. We finally made some progress.
We're not gonna stop now.

343
00:22:26.929 --> 00:22:28.222
Those humans.

344
00:22:29.682 --> 00:22:32.935
Their emotions blind them to reason
yet give them power.

345
00:22:34.103 --> 00:22:36.188
They'll find Flash first.

346
00:22:37.606 --> 00:22:39.400
And I'll be right behind them.

347
00:22:58.878 --> 00:23:00.880
You forget we had
an appointment in the books

348
00:23:00.963 --> 00:23:03.257
‘cause. usually.
we meet in the Speed Lab.

349
00:23:04.133 --> 00:23:06.927
Then again. I am a force god. So...

350
00:23:08.095 --> 00:23:10.556
I can work with this. too.
Ready for your treatment?

351
00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:14.184
I didn't forget we had an appointment.
I wanted you to find me here.

352
00:23:14.935 --> 00:23:15.936
Why?

353
00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:21.817
This is where your dad died.

354
00:23:23.944 --> 00:23:26.822
I can sense him walking
through here. six months ago.

355
00:23:28.073 --> 00:23:29.783
I came here earlier today

356
00:23:30.618 --> 00:23:33.537
and I saw these particles
near the tracks where my dad fell.

357
00:23:34.288 --> 00:23:36.999
And then I saw them again when I was
going through evidence from his death.

358
00:23:37.374 --> 00:23:40.294
This is a sign that there's
something wrong with my dad's death.

359
00:23:41.295 --> 00:23:42.880
Proof that someone is...

360
00:23:43.589 --> 00:23:46.175
altering reality
and leaving particles behind.

361
00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:49.720
But nobody's screwed with the timeline.
or I would've sensed that.

362
00:23:49.803 --> 00:23:51.263
Then. someone's hiding something.

363
00:23:51.555 --> 00:23:54.558
I need you to undo my treatments.
all of them.

364
00:23:54.642 --> 00:23:57.353
-You can't be serious.
-Deon. please.

365
00:23:58.062 --> 00:24:01.231
Whatever's happening.
its connected to these particles.

366
00:24:01.607 --> 00:24:04.902
If I absorb all of that
temporal matter out of you.

367
00:24:04.985 --> 00:24:07.529
and that sickness you got
starts spreading too fast.

368
00:24:07.947 --> 00:24:11.033
you're gonna start moving
in and out of timelines again.

369
00:24:11.659 --> 00:24:12.952
-Or worse.
-I'm not afraid of that.

370
00:24:13.035 --> 00:24:14.036
Well. I am.

371
00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:17.915
Look. if there's a chance that I can
save my husband and bring my dad back.

372
00:24:18.916 --> 00:24:19.792
I'll risk it.

373
00:24:33.055 --> 00:24:34.431
My God. what are they?

374
00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:39.103
Temporal isotopes.

375
00:24:41.063 --> 00:24:43.482
They're decaying instead of growing.

376
00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:48.028
That's why I couldn't sense them before.

377
00:24:50.572 --> 00:24:51.615
Oh. damn.

378
00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:59.331
Someone tapped into the Negative
Still Force to rewrite the timeline.

379
00:25:02.584 --> 00:25:04.169
Your dad wasn't supposed to die.

380
00:25:05.421 --> 00:25:07.798
But someone changed the past
to make sure that he did.

381
00:25:11.301 --> 00:25:12.761
Cecile. we need to talk
about Dillon.

382
00:25:13.303 --> 00:25:15.556
Look. I know. I get it. okay?

383
00:25:15.639 --> 00:25:20.227
Dillon can be a little intense.
but we're trying to beat Despero here.

384
00:25:21.103 --> 00:25:22.771
She wants you to forget about Joe.

385
00:25:23.689 --> 00:25:25.190
It's more than a little intense.

386
00:25:27.609 --> 00:25:31.405
And... honestly. it's not the first time

387
00:25:31.488 --> 00:25:33.240
I've seen you repress your feelings.

388
00:25:34.867 --> 00:25:37.036
You have no idea
what it's been like for me. None.

389
00:25:37.119 --> 00:25:40.539
Actually. I do. because
it's what I went through with Ronnie.

390
00:25:44.668 --> 00:25:46.670
After the particle accelerator exploded.

391
00:25:47.463 --> 00:25:52.217
I was so traumatized by his death
that even thinking about him

392
00:25:52.301 --> 00:25:53.719
would send me spiraling.

393
00:25:55.179 --> 00:25:58.766
Rather than facing my grief.

394
00:25:59.641 --> 00:26:03.062
I started fearing it. I just...

395
00:26:05.314 --> 00:26:07.524
I can't help thinking
you're heading down the same path.

396
00:26:09.276 --> 00:26:12.946
Okay. no. I know I don't talk about Joe.

397
00:26:15.783 --> 00:26:17.117
It's because I think about him

398
00:26:17.826 --> 00:26:22.748
every second of every hour of every day.

399
00:26:24.458 --> 00:26:27.252
And it's not just my grief
that I have to feel.

400
00:26:27.336 --> 00:26:31.256
Caitlin. Barry.
and Iris and little Jenna...

401
00:26:31.924 --> 00:26:37.054
because of my powers. whenever they're
near me. I feel all of their grief. too.

402
00:26:39.723 --> 00:26:41.391
It's everything that I can do

403
00:26:41.475 --> 00:26:44.478
to push it all down just so that
I can keep moving forward.

404
00:26:44.561 --> 00:26:47.523
because if I don't. I will drown...

405
00:26:48.732 --> 00:26:50.651
and that cannot happen again.

406
00:26:50.734 --> 00:26:54.655
I know it's hard.
but your strength as an empath.

407
00:26:56.365 --> 00:26:58.867
it doesn't come
from burying your emotions.

408
00:26:59.785 --> 00:27:01.954
It comes from feeling the feelings...

409
00:27:04.665 --> 00:27:05.958
even the hard ones.

410
00:27:10.671 --> 00:27:12.714
Let me guess. Dinner's ready.

411
00:27:13.215 --> 00:27:14.383
Oh!

412
00:27:14.508 --> 00:27:16.343
Sweet Joseph Winters. Okay.

413
00:27:16.552 --> 00:27:19.555
My phone is still plugged into
the S.T.A.R. Labs emergency sensors.

414
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:22.724
Someone just turned on
the particle accelerator.

415
00:27:27.938 --> 00:27:30.440
What the hell's going on?

416
00:27:30.524 --> 00:27:31.859
The power's spiking. sir.

417
00:27:32.234 --> 00:27:33.235
Impossible.

418
00:27:33.861 --> 00:27:36.196
It's like the particle accelerator
turned itself on.

419
00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.364
Not exactly.

420
00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.702
I may have given it a little push.

421
00:27:50.711 --> 00:27:51.712
Susan?

422
00:27:57.301 --> 00:27:58.760
Susan. what in the world--

423
00:28:01.305 --> 00:28:02.139
Checkmate.

424
00:28:14.902 --> 00:28:16.528
And with this power...

425
00:28:17.154 --> 00:28:20.240
no mind will shut its doors on me!

426
00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:31.960
Why would Despero
turn on the particle accelerator?

427
00:28:32.044 --> 00:28:34.463
He's into alternative energy. Who cares?

428
00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:37.257
Guys. look. she is right.
We need to do this.

429
00:28:38.675 --> 00:28:39.551
Okay.

430
00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:46.225
Remember what we did last time.

431
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.644
Remember that power.

432
00:28:56.652 --> 00:28:57.527
Come on.

433
00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.363
Where are you?

434
00:29:05.953 --> 00:29:06.787
I can see Flash.

435
00:29:07.329 --> 00:29:10.207
He's with Jefferson Pierce.
Where are they?

436
00:29:10.749 --> 00:29:11.625
Let me try and find out.

437
00:29:11.708 --> 00:29:14.419
I can feel your grief again. Horton.
I told you to bury it.

438
00:29:14.878 --> 00:29:16.546
Cecile. you don't have to listen to her.

439
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:18.674
You know your powers
better than she does.

440
00:29:20.884 --> 00:29:21.802
Hell yes.

441
00:29:22.511 --> 00:29:25.722
It's like meta-juicing.
only ten times better.

442
00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:36.149
You should be proud of the power
you displayed here.

443
00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:38.026
Now...

444
00:29:39.319 --> 00:29:40.988
open your minds to me...

445
00:29:41.363 --> 00:29:43.031
and show me the Flash.

446
00:29:43.115 --> 00:29:44.157
Leave us alone.

447
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.327
Guys... Who are they talking to?

448
00:29:47.411 --> 00:29:48.912
Despero. He must be here.

449
00:29:54.876 --> 00:29:55.961
Dillon. what are you doing?

450
00:29:56.211 --> 00:29:57.379
Causing a little vertigo.

451
00:29:58.046 --> 00:29:59.923
It's an oldie but a goodie.

452
00:30:08.223 --> 00:30:09.266
Okay. big boy.

453
00:30:09.725 --> 00:30:11.101
How about a little quid pro quo?

454
00:30:11.727 --> 00:30:15.355
I let you inside my mind.
show you where the Flash is...

455
00:30:16.315 --> 00:30:19.109
and then you and I go kill him together.

456
00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:22.321
What makes you think
I came here to bargain?

457
00:30:25.949 --> 00:30:26.825
Okay.

458
00:30:27.784 --> 00:30:31.538
How about I let you peek inside my mind
for free and we'll call it even?

459
00:30:37.336 --> 00:30:38.170
Dillon!

460
00:30:44.343 --> 00:30:45.218
Dillon!

461
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:50.098
I can't feel her anymore.

462
00:30:51.058 --> 00:30:53.560
-What did you do?
-I looked inside her mind.

463
00:30:54.311 --> 00:30:57.356
but I could only partly reconstruct
the Flash's location.

464
00:30:57.439 --> 00:31:00.817
The other half must be in yours.

465
00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:03.945
Don't be afraid.

466
00:31:04.488 --> 00:31:05.614
It's a necessity.

467
00:31:06.239 --> 00:31:07.949
I am trying to save the world.

468
00:31:08.033 --> 00:31:09.951
By killing us? And Barry?

469
00:31:10.243 --> 00:31:12.204
A few lives to spare billions.

470
00:31:12.579 --> 00:31:15.999
That's the trade I'm willing to make.
but one that you won't even stomach.

471
00:31:17.417 --> 00:31:19.961
Your mind's strong for a human empath.

472
00:31:20.379 --> 00:31:23.131
but it's kindling
compared to the Flame of Py'tar.

473
00:31:32.182 --> 00:31:34.976
Stop fighting me
and show me where he is.

474
00:31:36.144 --> 00:31:40.357
You have no allies left.
you're weak and you're alone.

475
00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:46.863
You're wrong.

476
00:31:47.781 --> 00:31:48.990
I am not alone.

477
00:32:00.252 --> 00:32:01.086
Hey.

478
00:32:01.378 --> 00:32:03.630
- Hey. you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

479
00:32:06.091 --> 00:32:07.426
She's alive. but barely.

480
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:09.553
Despero. he attacked us.

481
00:32:10.345 --> 00:32:11.471
How did you survive?

482
00:32:13.557 --> 00:32:14.599
I thought about Joe.

483
00:32:18.311 --> 00:32:19.813
Hey. wait. wait. wait. I found Barry.

484
00:32:21.731 --> 00:32:22.774
He's at the Hall.

485
00:32:23.066 --> 00:32:24.693
- What?
- Guys. guys.

486
00:32:24.818 --> 00:32:26.319
Despero was in my head.

487
00:32:27.404 --> 00:32:29.197
That means he knows where Barry is. too.

488
00:32:39.458 --> 00:32:40.792
All right.
maybe we should take a break.

489
00:32:40.876 --> 00:32:43.170
No. we have to finish
before Despero finds me.

490
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.464
Who the hell is Despero?

491
00:32:50.343 --> 00:32:52.637
If you're keeping something important
from me.

492
00:32:53.972 --> 00:32:55.348
I suggest you remedy it.

493
00:32:57.601 --> 00:32:58.602
He's from the future.

494
00:33:01.104 --> 00:33:02.772
He says that ten years from now.

495
00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.484
I'm going to destroy the world.

496
00:33:06.776 --> 00:33:07.652
You believe him?

497
00:33:09.779 --> 00:33:12.240
Do you remember what we said
when we first met during Crisis?

498
00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:13.992
We're not quitters.

499
00:33:14.701 --> 00:33:16.995
You can change your future.
just like you did back then--

500
00:33:17.078 --> 00:33:18.288
That's what I'm trying to do.

501
00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:21.875
If I get rid of my speed. I can
keep Despero's future from happening.

502
00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:24.836
What will this Despero do if you don't?

503
00:33:27.839 --> 00:33:28.757
He's going to kill me.

504
00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:31.468
You didn't think that was important
to mention?

505
00:33:31.551 --> 00:33:33.637
I knew if I told you.
you'd want to go after Despero.

506
00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.972
but I need you to follow
the Injustice Protocols.

507
00:33:36.973 --> 00:33:39.559
I'm not acting out of fear.
I'm trying to do the right thing.

508
00:33:39.643 --> 00:33:42.062
Yeah. I thought I was too. but I wasn't.
and you weren't. either.

509
00:33:42.395 --> 00:33:43.396
You're just...

510
00:33:43.813 --> 00:33:46.525
afraid of becoming this man
that Despero says you are.

511
00:33:46.608 --> 00:33:47.943
I've already hurt people!

512
00:33:48.193 --> 00:33:51.655
-I'm already a liability!
-No. what you are is a hero.

513
00:33:52.322 --> 00:33:53.532
Doesn't that mean something?

514
00:33:54.616 --> 00:33:56.368
I've seen what happens.

515
00:33:57.244 --> 00:33:59.496
What I end up doing.
It's going to happen.

516
00:33:59.871 --> 00:34:02.374
Getting rid of my speed
is the only way to save the world.

517
00:34:02.457 --> 00:34:03.291
Damn it. Jefferson.

518
00:34:03.375 --> 00:34:05.293
it's the only way
to save your family. too!

519
00:34:08.338 --> 00:34:10.507
I suggest you keep my family
out of this.

520
00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:11.925
After everything we've done today.

521
00:34:12.008 --> 00:34:13.885
everything I've told you.
you're just giving up.

522
00:34:15.554 --> 00:34:16.596
Barry...

523
00:34:17.847 --> 00:34:20.559
you need to think
very carefully right now.

524
00:34:20.642 --> 00:34:23.770
I'm asking you to save
the world and you won't even listen!

525
00:34:31.069 --> 00:34:32.195
You're gonna hear me now...

526
00:34:33.196 --> 00:34:35.532
‘cause one way or the other.
you're going to help me finish this.

527
00:34:49.421 --> 00:34:50.714
Look at what I just did!

528
00:34:51.423 --> 00:34:52.882
The damage I can still cause.

529
00:34:53.883 --> 00:34:56.803
You made a promise to keep
this world safe.

530
00:34:59.514 --> 00:35:01.057
I am keeping the world safe!

531
00:35:01.516 --> 00:35:03.101
By saving one of its protectors!

532
00:35:13.236 --> 00:35:15.822
Fine. You wanna ignore the protocols?

533
00:35:16.197 --> 00:35:17.657
Now imagine millions dead...

534
00:35:18.241 --> 00:35:19.492
all because of me!

535
00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:35.300
It's your lightning. you keep it.

536
00:35:38.053 --> 00:35:41.890
How about we stop this insanity? Huh?

537
00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.606
You remember why we call
our safety plan "Injustice"?

538
00:35:51.232 --> 00:35:52.567
Because if one of us goes rogue.

539
00:35:53.777 --> 00:35:55.654
the rest of the world
doesn't stand a chance.

540
00:36:30.855 --> 00:36:32.023
You think this is...

541
00:36:32.941 --> 00:36:34.109
what he would have wanted?

542
00:36:37.696 --> 00:36:41.616
You told me that before... Crisis.
Oliver went to the Monitor.

543
00:36:42.826 --> 00:36:44.160
to trade his life for yours.

544
00:36:46.663 --> 00:36:48.957
Now. I never met the man.
so you tell me.

545
00:36:49.708 --> 00:36:50.750
Why'd he do that?

546
00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:53.628
Because he was afraid?

547
00:36:55.964 --> 00:36:56.798
No.

548
00:36:58.007 --> 00:36:59.175
A man like him...

549
00:36:59.884 --> 00:37:02.220
lays down his life for a man like you...

550
00:37:03.179 --> 00:37:04.305
for one reason.

551
00:37:05.598 --> 00:37:07.350
Because you are the best of us.

552
00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:12.147
Oliver Queen wasn't a quitter.

553
00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:14.774
He'd never quit on you.

554
00:37:16.401 --> 00:37:18.987
So don't you dare quit on yourself.

555
00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:25.410
Jefferson. I'm so sorry.

556
00:37:29.414 --> 00:37:30.331
It's okay.

557
00:37:34.002 --> 00:37:35.086
Just tell me this.

558
00:37:40.383 --> 00:37:41.342
Where's the future?

559
00:37:46.014 --> 00:37:46.890
It's right here.

560
00:37:48.266 --> 00:37:49.309
Whose life is this?

561
00:37:51.895 --> 00:37:52.771
Mine.

562
00:37:54.522 --> 00:37:55.815
So what are you gonna do with it?

563
00:37:58.902 --> 00:37:59.903
Live it...

564
00:38:01.154 --> 00:38:02.572
by any means necessary.

565
00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:13.416
I told you. Flash.

566
00:38:13.625 --> 00:38:16.085
If I found any trace
of your true nature.

567
00:38:17.545 --> 00:38:19.631
I'd end your existence.

568
00:38:20.799 --> 00:38:23.301
Leave him alone. He's innocent.

569
00:38:23.843 --> 00:38:26.763
Someone changed the timeline to Kill
my father and make Barry seem insane.

570
00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:29.599
You really believe
you're telling the truth.

571
00:38:34.103 --> 00:38:35.188
How tragic.

572
00:38:43.822 --> 00:38:44.948
Hurry. I'll hold him off.

573
00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:52.831
You need to go and figure out
who is trying to frame you.

574
00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:55.917
I need to go to the future.

575
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.752
to see who really causes Armageddon.

576
00:38:59.754 --> 00:39:00.880
I can't hold him much longer.

577
00:39:00.964 --> 00:39:03.716
I'm not gonna make it there.
I don't have enough Speed Force left.

578
00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.260
How about some Still Force?

579
00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.557
My isotopes will pull you
toward any weird temporal activity.

580
00:39:12.934 --> 00:39:14.269
Run. Barry! Run!

581
00:39:23.403 --> 00:39:25.321
You all just killed this world.

582
00:40:14.621 --> 00:40:17.290
If I could have
everyone's attention for a moment.

583
00:40:18.917 --> 00:40:22.003
I have been waiting
for this moment for a very.

584
00:40:22.837 --> 00:40:23.922
very long time.

585
00:40:24.756 --> 00:40:25.882
When you find...

586
00:40:26.716 --> 00:40:27.967
...the love of your life.

587
00:40:28.301 --> 00:40:30.345
it's like electricity

588
00:40:31.012 --> 00:40:32.430
pulsing through your veins.

589
00:40:32.555 --> 00:40:36.059
giving you a shock that you absolutely
never want to end.

590
00:40:36.559 --> 00:40:37.560
Because...

591
00:40:38.978 --> 00:40:40.229
because now...

592
00:40:43.358 --> 00:40:46.152
now you're a part of something greater.

593
00:40:46.611 --> 00:40:47.904
A part of something wonderful.

594
00:40:51.199 --> 00:40:53.117
and frankly. surprising.

595
00:40:53.201 --> 00:40:54.911
because you never know...

596
00:40:57.163 --> 00:40:59.624
what face fate will be wearing

597
00:41:00.083 --> 00:41:05.254
when she shows up to knock on your door
and change your life... forever.

598
00:41:05.755 --> 00:41:08.049
But when it does.
for you. my wish is that.

599
00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:09.175
that face...

600
00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:14.681
is as beautiful as the one
standing next to me. To Iris West...

601
00:41:16.641 --> 00:41:17.725
the love of my life.

602
00:41:20.603 --> 00:41:22.063
And to our future together.

603
00:41:35.493 --> 00:41:37.036
What the hell is he doing here?

604
00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:45.060
