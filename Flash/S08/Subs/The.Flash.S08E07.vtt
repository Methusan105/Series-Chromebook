ï»¿1
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.217
10-38 on Dayton Boulevard
at Second Street intersection.

2
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.384
unit en route.

3
00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:12.387
Routine traffic stop downtown.

4
00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:13.680
Oh. yeah.

5
00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:17.100
It looks like it was a good day
to pull monitor duty. Chester P.

6
00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:20.479
Ooh. Snack time.

7
00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:30.739
Damn!

8
00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:33.700
I was supposed to make
the egg salad this morning.

9
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:37.371
Grandma Runk
is going to be epically mad.

10
00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:38.956
Now I got nada for lunch.

11
00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:47.714
Although. legally. I am entitled
to break every four hours.

12
00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.925
and it's only gonna take me.
like. four minutes

13
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:53.470
because the kitchen
is just right down the hall.

14
00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.684
Then again. that is time enough
for a nuclear meltdown

15
00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:00.852
and an alien invasion in this town.

16
00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:02.187
-So--
-Hey. Chuck.

17
00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:04.273
Oh. what up. A?

18
00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:06.441
I thought you'd be working.

19
00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:09.653
I was. And then I remembered
it's Wednesday.

20
00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:13.365
and that place I told you about at
last week's D&D game. Hirschfield's.

21
00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:16.910
Today is when they have their amazing
chicken Parmesan sandwiches.

22
00:01:16.994 --> 00:01:18.996
So I thought. "It's lunchtime.

23
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:20.622
Why not surprise you with the treat?"

24
00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:22.374
Wow. thanks.

25
00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:24.793
Guess I'm lunch date worthy now. huh?

26
00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.462
Chuck. you are date worthy
in all the major categories.

27
00:01:28.547 --> 00:01:29.464
I am?

28
00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:31.008
Yeah. definitely.

29
00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.760
I mean. that's good.

30
00:01:33.844 --> 00:01:38.765
That's good to know. you know.
and I. too. think that you are also.

31
00:01:39.558 --> 00:01:44.855
um. what you just. like. worthy
of what you just said a second ago.

32
00:01:49.568 --> 00:01:51.403
Holy Alice H. Parker.

33
00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:53.363
Okay. we've got a mugging
in progress up at 119.

34
00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:55.907
And a carjacking at
the Edwards Center parking lot.

35
00:01:55.991 --> 00:01:57.534
And a hold up at Jitters.

36
00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.411
And they're all happening right now.

37
00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.496
Don't worry. guys. already on it.

38
00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:03.206
Uh. all of it. Boss?

39
00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:14.551
You heard me.
I want everything in the register.

40
00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:18.013
and a triple shot latte
with oat milk. not soy!

41
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.935
I think these guys could use
some help finding their cells.

42
00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:25.896
Thanks. Flash.

43
00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:27.397
Yeah.

44
00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:30.817
What's going on out here?

45
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:32.903
-I didn't do nothing.
-l want to see my lawyer.

46
00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.404
Yeah. what they said.

47
00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:35.614
Hey...

48
00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:38.200
Any chance Flash brought
that latte I ordered?

49
00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.870
Officers. take these gentlemen
to holding. please.

50
00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:44.289
Ow.

51
00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:48.210
Captain. Hey.

52
00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.337
Staff meeting's canceled. Allen.

53
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.546
and for the record.
you'd have been late.

54
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.300
Sorry. I. uh. was just-- I got caught up
with a little blood spatter analysis.

55
00:02:55.384 --> 00:02:56.677
but it looks like
you've had a busy morning.

56
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.763
Yeah. and it's about to turn into
a busy afternoon. evening and night.

57
00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:02.724
thanks to this generous donation
from the Scarlet Speedster.

58
00:03:03.392 --> 00:03:05.894
But the Flash caught those guys.
that's a good thing. right?

59
00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:09.106
How can I press charges when
I don't know what crimes were committed.

60
00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.273
how they were done and where?

61
00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:12.401
I forgot that file's on my desk.
I'll be right back.

62
00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:15.320
And it's not like we can just
call up the Flash and ask.

63
00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.572
Yeah. like on a Flash phone or--

64
00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:18.949
Yeah.

65
00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:20.075
That's a terrible name.

66
00:03:20.826 --> 00:03:21.660
Yeah.

67
00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:26.331
Uh. but Captain. C.C.P.D.'s never had
a line to the Flash before.

68
00:03:26.415 --> 00:03:28.083
Yeah. But. for once.
I would like to feel

69
00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.836
like the Flash and law enforcement
are on the same page.

70
00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:33.213
Instead of us just
always playing catch up.

71
00:03:33.964 --> 00:03:37.759
But. since that's not happening.
cancel any plans you have for tonight.

72
00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.261
We've got a lot of legwork to do.

73
00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.058
You're welcome.

74
00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:05.036
Sounds like Kramer has a point.

75
00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:07.456
Uh. look. maybe I could do
a better job communicating

76
00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:08.582
when I'm dropping off criminals.

77
00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:11.209
But giving C.C.P.D.
a direct line to the Flash.

78
00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:13.336
you don't really think
that's necessary. do you?

79
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.922
I don't know. Barr. When I was captain.
I had a direct line to the Flash.

80
00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:19.009
Mm. I mean. me. too.

81
00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.678
When I was district attorney.
if I had a question on a case.

82
00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:23.555
all I ever had to do was call you
and get the details.

83
00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:24.931
That's because you're family.

84
00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:26.558
Which she is not. and I get that.

85
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:29.811
But what she and I went through
when we were tracking down Craig.

86
00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:32.355
l... I trust her with my life.

87
00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.484
And maybe you should consider
letting her in a bit more.

88
00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:38.945
Give her one of the alert apps
that we all have on our phones.

89
00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.739
Joe. look. I get it. She's a good cop.

90
00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:41.740
She's a great captain.

91
00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:43.950
And when I first got my speed.

92
00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:46.411
I needed a lot of help.
Not just from Caitlin and Cisco.

93
00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:48.538
but from you and everybody at C.C.P.D.

94
00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.500
-But now--
-Now you've leveled up.

95
00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:53.794
Yeah.

96
00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.798
Which means I can find other ways
to solve Kramer's Flash problem.

97
00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:01.134
like doing extra C.S.I. work to collect
what she needs for processing.

98
00:05:01.218 --> 00:05:03.678
I mean. that'll ease
the burden for her. right?

99
00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:08.975
It sounds like it. and I get how
keeping church and state separated

100
00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:11.186
is the easiest choice.
but I also know Kramer.

101
00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:14.439
and if she's asking
for a line to the Flash.

102
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.150
she probably has a good reason.
Just saying.

103
00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:21.571
Maybe you want to think about it
before you decide what to do. Barr.

104
00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:31.957
Waddup. party people!

105
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.668
It's your boy. Chester P.
and I'm ready to rock your world

106
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:39.506
with knowledge
for free. free. free. free.

107
00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.133
Hey. today we have a self-flying drone

108
00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:45.512
based off of an Al algorithm
created by yours truly.

109
00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:47.556
I'm gonna upload the specs online

110
00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.101
because here at the Runk Yard.
we keep tech openly sourced.

111
00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:52.644
and classy.

112
00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:54.312
All right.
how is this even possible?

113
00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.274
I have silenced my phone.

114
00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:00.068
I have turned off all the notifications.
and look at what keeps popping up.

115
00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:03.196
This all from Frost and Mark?

116
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.074
Oh. you mean my sister
and her ex-con-boyfriend?

117
00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:08.034
Yes. they are.
Look at what they're doing.

118
00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:11.746
Looks cool.

119
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:12.956
No. it looks dangerous.

120
00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:16.668
Hey. hey. Caitlin. do you mind just
taking a wee little step to the right?

121
00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.254
Are you live streaming?

122
00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:20.589
Uh-huh. Yeah.

123
00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:22.591
WookiLover77 says.

124
00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:23.884
"Who's the girl?

125
00:06:24.301 --> 00:06:25.927
Her sister seems cooler."

126
00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:27.554
Okay. that's it for today.

127
00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:28.930
Smash that "Like" button.

128
00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:31.766
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

129
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:32.767
I'm just so annoyed.

130
00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:35.437
Mark keeps taking Frost
on all these ridiculous dates.

131
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.272
Well. maybe tonight will distract you.

132
00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:38.440
Don't you have a date. too?

133
00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:42.986
Yes. Yeah. Marcus is taking me
to the Spanish Hamper.

134
00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.239
How'd he get you guys a reservation
for the hottest place in town?

135
00:06:46.323 --> 00:06:47.324
That's impressive.

136
00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:48.867
Is it turning serious?

137
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:53.204
I mean. he's really nice.
and I like nice.

138
00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:55.999
So. that's nice. It's nice.

139
00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:58.752
Oh. man. I can see it now.

140
00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:00.837
He doesn't know we're on Team Flash.

141
00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:02.964
But soon. you and Marcus
are gonna fall in love.

142
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:05.467
and then he's going to join us for.
like. some crazy adventure.

143
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.344
Then. boom! He's on the team.

144
00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:11.306
Hey. hey. maybe he'll learn
how to control plants.

145
00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:12.933
It's their third date. Chuck.

146
00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:14.017
So maybe just slow your roll.

147
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.394
You're right. right. Reel it.
Reel it back.

148
00:07:16.645 --> 00:07:18.480
Yeah. speaking of.
I should go get ready.

149
00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:19.898
Good night. guys.

150
00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:21.441
-Have fun.
-Bye.

151
00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:24.486
Fancy date night.

152
00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:26.529
-Sounds expensive.
-Yeah. right.

153
00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:31.409
Could be fun. though.

154
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:38.291
Yeah. I have to go write. article...

155
00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:40.126
I gotta type things.
algorithms and such. Mm-hmm.

156
00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:42.504
Oh. that's a typo.

157
00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:45.173
-Huh? Oh.
-No. uh. I'm just thinking out loud.

158
00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:46.758
I'm just gonna--

159
00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:55.850
Hey. Captain. you got a sec?

160
00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:57.686
I'm on my way to Processing.

161
00:07:57.769 --> 00:07:58.728
These will come in handy.

162
00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:02.023
Um. I cross referenced the 911 calls
from this morning

163
00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:04.150
with the description of the perps
that the Flash brought in.

164
00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:07.070
And then I hit the crime scenes.
fingerprints. security footage.

165
00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.613
Korber even interviewed witnesses.

166
00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:11.032
So. this should be everything you need
to wrap up these cases.

167
00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:12.993
Wow. I appreciate the hustle. Allen.

168
00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:15.954
I just wish it was more than
a band aid on a bullet wound.

169
00:08:16.788 --> 00:08:19.791
Well. you have more than enough
to charge all three suspects.

170
00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:22.419
What about the suspects
the Flash drops off tomorrow.

171
00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:24.045
or the day after that?

172
00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:26.840
Respectfully. Captain.
I mean. this is the way

173
00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:29.592
we've done things the past seven years.
ever since the Flash showed up.

174
00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:31.594
You know. the system works.

175
00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:33.054
From your perspective.

176
00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:34.681
But there are things
you don't need to worry about

177
00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:37.559
as a forensic scientist
that I need to consider as Captain.

178
00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:38.977
I understand that.

179
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.438
But you know. the Flash
is just trying to help this city.

180
00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.064
And he does. all the time.

181
00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:46.151
But together.
we could help it even more.

182
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.654
humans and meta-humans alike.

183
00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:51.239
Now. if you'll excuse me.

184
00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:59.372
Hey. hey. hey.

185
00:08:59.396 --> 00:09:01.396
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

186
00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:33.114
Time to get to work.

187
00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:53.676
What the hell?

188
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:56.805
What are these?

189
00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:01.434
They're meta dampening bracelets.

190
00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:04.562
I've seen these before.

191
00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:07.107
Wakey wakey. ladies and gents in blue.

192
00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:09.609
Folks call me Goldface.

193
00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:13.655
That's because if it's made of gold.
it's mine to control.

194
00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:15.865
From your dental fillings

195
00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:19.828
to 0.35 grams of gold
in your cell phones.

196
00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:22.205
Don't even bother
trying to phone a friend.

197
00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:24.791
Because we knocked out
the nearest cell phone tower.

198
00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:27.585
But. if anyone does come calling.

199
00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:30.505
they'll find a couple of
Central City's finest outside

200
00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:32.090
telling them there's a gas leak.

201
00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:37.011
What are you doing? What are you-- Hey.

202
00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:40.473
Goldface.

203
00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:42.851
This is my precinct.

204
00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:46.229
You have a problem.
you take it up with me.

205
00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:47.647
But my officers go.

206
00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:49.566
Ah.

207
00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.152
If it isn't the famous Kristen Kramer.

208
00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.405
I loved you on the Citizentopia podcast.

209
00:10:56.447 --> 00:10:57.365
Very inspiring.

210
00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:58.616
Thanks.

211
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.661
Captain. I'm guessing
you want to play hero.

212
00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:06.291
Let me let my man Carver here
show you what happens

213
00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:08.668
to anyone that gets out of line.

214
00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:13.715
Now. you may have all noticed that
you're sporting a new piece of jewelry.

215
00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:16.968
Well. since Captain Mimic here
outed herself as a meta.

216
00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:19.512
I figured she may not be
the only one of you.

217
00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:21.931
But these bracelets.

218
00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:23.933
they don't just dampen powers.

219
00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:26.019
they also do this.

220
00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:42.994
You feeling me now. Captain?

221
00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:48.166
Hold on.

222
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.876
Don't I know you?

223
00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:53.671
You're that rat that cost me
the organ printer.

224
00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:55.131
The chemist!

225
00:11:58.176 --> 00:12:00.595
Yes. Um. yeah.

226
00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:04.766
Look. I was on an undercover assignment.

227
00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:08.353
Look. why don't you just tell us
what it is you want?

228
00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:11.648
Nobody has to die tonight.

229
00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:16.986
You know. my lady. Amunet Black?

230
00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:21.407
Not only is she the finest female
this side of the Mississippi.

231
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.535
she's got some intel
that there are some very rare

232
00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:27.830
and valuable items in your armory.

233
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.625
I want what's in there.

234
00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:32.835
So I'mma go get it.

235
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.881
And if anyone tries anything...

236
00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:39.801
We get the belt.

237
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.138
Good memory. chemist.

238
00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:48.559
Keep an eye on this one.

239
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.521
He smells of trouble.

240
00:13:00.863 --> 00:13:02.949
Seriously. Marcus. I am so sorry.

241
00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:06.327
I cannot believe I made
a dinner reservation for next January.

242
00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:07.370
Please don't feel bad.

243
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.330
Last week at work.
I screwed up the blooming cycle

244
00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:11.332
for the Selenicereus grandiflorus
I've been growing.

245
00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:13.167
Should've seen all the pollen.

246
00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:15.628
Thank you. I mean. you're really.
you're just such a trouper.

247
00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:17.630
This first round is on me.

248
00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:22.218
This place is a little seedier
than I remember.

249
00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:24.012
It's fun. Plus. they got karaoke.

250
00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:25.930
Next up. The Ice Pack.

251
00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:27.181
-There is that.
-Yeah.

252
00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:29.475
You're as cold as ice

253
00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:34.439
You're willing to sacrifice our love

254
00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:36.983
Hey! Way off-key but they're committed.

255
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:40.570
We need to leave.

256
00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:43.656
Caity?

257
00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:46.159
What a coinkidink.

258
00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:47.785
What are the two of you doing here?

259
00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:52.206
We are just grabbing a casual drink.
but it's too crowded in here.

260
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:56.502
Whoa. whoa. whoa! Is this
the infamous Marcus. as in Dr. Ficus?

261
00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:59.922
-Um... Yes.
-Holy crap!

262
00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:02.300
Hey. you two are here.

263
00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:03.634
Mark and I are here.

264
00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.511
We should totally make this
a double date.

265
00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:06.429
Yes!

266
00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:08.306
Oh. no. we'll let you get back to it.

267
00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:10.391
Hey. they've got great food here.

268
00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:12.727
-Um. if you like to live dangerously.
-We don't.

269
00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.146
But you want to stay. right?

270
00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:17.106
- We can workshop some plant-y ice puns.
- Um...

271
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.734
Um. well. I've heard a lot about Frost.

272
00:14:19.817 --> 00:14:22.320
It'd be nice to have a person
to go with the stories.

273
00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:25.073
Yeah. yeah.

274
00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:27.450
Great.

275
00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:28.701
Let's double date.

276
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.374
I count three hostiles
guarding us here. two at the exits.

277
00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:37.710
Carver's with Goldface
in the armory.

278
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.255
We have the numbers
to take back the building.

279
00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:45.385
Except everyone on our side
has a bomb strapped to their wrist.

280
00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:48.805
These things are ultra-sensitive.

281
00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:50.598
You tamper with them. they'll blow.

282
00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:52.183
The same goes for Goldface's belt.

283
00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:55.144
We've got to do something.

284
00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:57.438
Whatever it is. we've got to do it fast.

285
00:15:00.024 --> 00:15:02.568
Captain. do you have any idea what
Goldface wants in the armory?

286
00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:08.825
All I can tell you. Allen.
is if he gets in there.

287
00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:11.411
things are gonna get a lot worse.

288
00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:22.547
Open sesame.

289
00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:24.632
According to Amunet's intel.

290
00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:29.137
the target should be in there.

291
00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:39.730
I love my woman.

292
00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:49.240
Not what you're expecting. Boss?

293
00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:50.908
Of course it's not. It's empty.

294
00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:54.328
Go get Kramer.

295
00:15:57.999 --> 00:15:59.375
And her little chemist. too.

296
00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:07.967
Where the hell are they?

297
00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:09.552
I don't know what you mean.

298
00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:14.182
The meta-bullets.

299
00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:17.852
Remember. Captain? The ones you had
commissioned for your task force?

300
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:21.022
One shot takes away
any meta's powers forever.

301
00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:24.025
Am I ringing any bells?

302
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.318
That's what you're stealing?

303
00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:27.987
That's what I'm selling.

304
00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:32.116
The power to take down
any meta in this city.

305
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.827
including. say it with me... The Flash.

306
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:42.502
Well. that's going to bring me
a lot of gold.

307
00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:45.838
But those bullets
aren't where they're supposed to be.

308
00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.382
Captain. any thoughts on that?

309
00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:50.801
Yeah.

310
00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:56.474
Those bullets belong to C.C.P.D.
for only the most severe emergencies.

311
00:16:57.391 --> 00:17:01.020
Also. I'd die before betraying
the metas of this city.

312
00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:02.438
and putting them in any danger.

313
00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:03.689
Mm.

314
00:17:04.398 --> 00:17:06.859
I'm willing to bet you'd risk
your own life. Captain. but...

315
00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:13.866
How about this fool's?

316
00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:26.254
Let him go!

317
00:17:27.004 --> 00:17:28.839
Tell me where the meta-bullets
are hidden. Captain.

318
00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:30.424
You have till three.

319
00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:33.052
One. two...

320
00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:35.596
I can help you.

321
00:17:37.598 --> 00:17:40.643
Oh. yeah. chemist?
Like you helped me steal that printer?

322
00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:43.312
The meta-bullets have trace elements
of the dark matter.

323
00:17:44.522 --> 00:17:46.983
-I've got a scanner in my lab.
-Let me guess.

324
00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:49.569
I let you go. you go get it
and bring it right back to me?

325
00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:50.820
Allen. what are you doing?

326
00:17:51.028 --> 00:17:52.238
I can adjust the scanner.

327
00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:54.824
It will find the bullets.
They have to be here somewhere.

328
00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:07.211
When we first met.
I knew you couldn't be trusted.

329
00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:11.799
Plot twist. You're not only
untrustworthy. you're a coward.

330
00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:13.926
Watch Kramer.

331
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.595
I'm gonna take the chemist here
on a little field trip.

332
00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:18.389
One last chance to live up to his name.

333
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:27.064
All right.

334
00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:31.027
We got a Dark 'N' Stormy for Marcus.
Chardonnay for Caitlin.

335
00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:34.739
and a whisky for Mark and me.
on the rocks. of course.

336
00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:36.073
Thanks. Snowflake.

337
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.914
You know. there's a cactus plant
that makes great cocktails.

338
00:18:44.415 --> 00:18:47.168
The pads of the Opuntia cacti
pair perfectly with an agave spirit.

339
00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:49.253
I bet it would really cover the taste
of strychnine. too.

340
00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:52.131
- Strychnine!
- Wow.

341
00:18:52.214 --> 00:18:55.509
A genius botanist.
who can mix drinks. I like him already.

342
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.596
So. how did you two meet?

343
00:18:59.055 --> 00:18:59.889
Oh--

344
00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:03.309
Well. we met here. actually. Mark was--

345
00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:06.604
Pouring beers by day
and murdering delivery men by night.

346
00:19:09.023 --> 00:19:11.692
-What? It's true.
-She's exaggerating it.

347
00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:13.152
Well. not exactly.

348
00:19:13.444 --> 00:19:14.362
Okay. fine.

349
00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:17.490
Mark and I each spent some time
on the wrong side of the law.

350
00:19:17.573 --> 00:19:21.827
But I paid for my crimes.
and Mark turned state's witness

351
00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:23.412
against some really bad guys.

352
00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:26.082
Yeah. and the DA expunged my record.

353
00:19:26.457 --> 00:19:28.167
So now. clean as a whistle.

354
00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:30.795
Well. seems like you've
turned over a new leaf.

355
00:19:30.878 --> 00:19:32.296
Hey. Dr. Ficus.

356
00:19:32.546 --> 00:19:33.923
-There he is.
-So good.

357
00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:35.299
Hey. I kind of like that.

358
00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:40.304
Listen. Frost and I are going skydiving
again next weekend.

359
00:19:41.764 --> 00:19:42.848
Double date round two?

360
00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:45.184
What do you say?
I mean. you seem cool. man.

361
00:19:45.351 --> 00:19:47.311
I don't know. I've...
I've always wanted to go skydiving.

362
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.105
I'm game. What do you say. Caity?

363
00:19:52.358 --> 00:19:56.779
Marcus. did you know
that when Mark got out.

364
00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:58.864
he seduced my sister

365
00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:01.701
so that he could steal a weapon out
from right under her nose.

366
00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:06.163
-After he helped us save the day.
-And she was so upset

367
00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:11.335
that she just kept moping and crying
and even needed to take a sabbatical.

368
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.671
-Caitlin--
-I apologized for all of that.

369
00:20:13.754 --> 00:20:14.630
And I accepted it.

370
00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:17.216
Frost. I mean. how naive can you be?
He's already betrayed you.

371
00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:19.427
And yet you're out there live streaming
the two of you

372
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:21.846
jumping out of airplanes
and making out on cliffs.

373
00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:25.099
-Remember Mount Shasta?
-Hell yeah.

374
00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:26.892
Frost. what is wrong with you?

375
00:20:27.143 --> 00:20:30.479
You're acting like some stupid teenager
falling in love with this guy.

376
00:20:30.604 --> 00:20:31.897
who's already hurt you.

377
00:20:32.022 --> 00:20:35.234
And. guess what.
is definitely going to do it again.

378
00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:36.277
And you know what?

379
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.863
When that happens.
I am not picking up the pieces

380
00:20:38.946 --> 00:20:41.157
because I am done with broken hearts.
You got that?

381
00:20:42.825 --> 00:20:43.868
You know. we get it.

382
00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:48.164
You don't like me. but Frost is an adult
with her own life.

383
00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:49.832
and so long as she's choosing
to spend it with me.

384
00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:51.041
then you need to deal with it.

385
00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:57.256
Are you really going to let him
talk to me that way?

386
00:20:57.339 --> 00:20:59.008
-Your sister?
-Yeah. I am.

387
00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:03.471
Because he's my boyfriend and anything
else is none of your damn business.

388
00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:15.816
Hey.

389
00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:18.235
I think I'd like to go home.

390
00:21:20.404 --> 00:21:22.072
-I'll pull the car around.
-Yeah.

391
00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:37.713
I'm sorry. Do you mind?

392
00:21:38.088 --> 00:21:39.256
Oh. My bad.

393
00:21:39.507 --> 00:21:41.592
Maybe I should just take
a leisurely stroll down the hallway.

394
00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:45.930
I'm gonna watch you like a hawk
watching a juicy vole.

395
00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:51.769
Do you need to take that?

396
00:21:55.815 --> 00:21:59.109
Baby girl. what time is it now
in London town?

397
00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:02.863
You eating a nice balanced breakfast
like we discussed.

398
00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:04.532
not just the bangers and mash?

399
00:22:06.116 --> 00:22:06.951
Meta-bullets?

400
00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:09.745
Yep. not exactly.

401
00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:12.164
Yeah. uh-huh. Yeah. baby...

402
00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:14.458
I know the buyer's schedule. baby.

403
00:22:16.293 --> 00:22:17.211
Yes. baby.

404
00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:19.463
No. we just hit a teensy little snag.

405
00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:21.298
But you know me.

406
00:22:21.507 --> 00:22:22.466
I got it all worked out.

407
00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.636
Okay. I love you. too.

408
00:22:28.639 --> 00:22:30.599
I said. I love you up top. Ammy Whammy.

409
00:22:31.183 --> 00:22:33.936
I lub. lub. tub. Ammy Whammy.

410
00:22:38.941 --> 00:22:39.775
I say something funny?

411
00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:42.611
No. No. you just--

412
00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:46.031
You seem to have a great relationship
with Amunet.

413
00:22:46.448 --> 00:22:49.076
Police reports
say you work together now.

414
00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:51.245
Damn right.
we have a great relationship.

415
00:22:51.412 --> 00:22:53.455
-and it's because we work together.
-Hmm.

416
00:22:53.664 --> 00:22:57.918
Ammy and I used to have separate crews.
separate heists. separate hideouts.

417
00:22:58.043 --> 00:23:00.921
but it's like Dr. Finkel says.

418
00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:03.591
"If you want your partner
to enter your heart.

419
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.303
you can't just open the doors.
You gotta open the windows."

420
00:23:09.763 --> 00:23:11.932
So. you see Dr. Finkel?

421
00:23:13.475 --> 00:23:15.519
Sharon sees us. man.

422
00:23:16.687 --> 00:23:19.690
Okay? And she helped us realize
that we never were truly committed.

423
00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:22.568
But now we're not just partners in love.

424
00:23:23.986 --> 00:23:24.862
we're partners in crime.

425
00:23:26.322 --> 00:23:28.407
And since we stopped holding back
and have gone all in.

426
00:23:28.824 --> 00:23:30.409
our relationship's never been better.

427
00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.620
or more lucrative.

428
00:23:36.665 --> 00:23:40.044
And if I don't have those meta-bullets
in hand. within the next hour.

429
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.255
Ammy Whammy says
our buyer is going to walk.

430
00:23:43.547 --> 00:23:47.092
So. you... look. the dark matter
we're looking for is microscopic.

431
00:23:47.176 --> 00:23:48.928
So. I'm sorry.
I'm going to need more time.

432
00:23:49.178 --> 00:23:52.264
No. You need incentive.

433
00:23:55.351 --> 00:23:57.227
Barry. you don't have to help him.

434
00:23:58.187 --> 00:24:00.147
Finish the scanner now.

435
00:24:00.773 --> 00:24:02.483
Or your Captain gets to meet
the white whale.

436
00:24:03.275 --> 00:24:04.193
Hell yeah.

437
00:24:04.568 --> 00:24:07.613
She's gonna
walk the plank. y'all.

438
00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:10.616
Ahab didn't-- I'm sorry.

439
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.326
do you not know Moby Dick?

440
00:24:13.577 --> 00:24:15.412
"To the last I grapple with thee."

441
00:24:16.497 --> 00:24:20.167
What about Wrath of Khan?
"From hell's heart I stab at thee.

442
00:24:20.542 --> 00:24:23.003
For hate's sake I spit my last..."

443
00:24:24.922 --> 00:24:27.299
I bought you a first edition
for your birthday.

444
00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.638
BA in Literature from Yale.
I'm surrounded by Philistines.

445
00:24:35.015 --> 00:24:35.849
Time's up. Waste her.

446
00:24:35.933 --> 00:24:37.434
No. Wait. wait. wait.

447
00:24:37.726 --> 00:24:42.940
Um. look. it might not be perfect.
but the scanner is done.

448
00:24:43.607 --> 00:24:45.693
Now. there's that service
with a smile I've been waiting for.

449
00:24:45.901 --> 00:24:47.027
Uh...

450
00:24:47.111 --> 00:24:50.781
So. all you have to do
is touch this button right here.

451
00:24:58.539 --> 00:25:00.040
Put these in. Put these in.

452
00:25:01.875 --> 00:25:02.710
How did you...

453
00:25:02.793 --> 00:25:04.670
I've reset the scanner from infrared
to infrasonic.

454
00:25:04.753 --> 00:25:06.005
Come on. We gotta go. Come on.

455
00:25:15.014 --> 00:25:16.348
Time to make them go boom. boss?

456
00:25:16.432 --> 00:25:17.641
Not when she's the only one
who can tell me

457
00:25:17.725 --> 00:25:18.892
where the bullets are hidden now.

458
00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:20.269
Find them.

459
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:24.523
Nobody hides from Goldface.

460
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:26.191
Nobody!

461
00:25:35.409 --> 00:25:36.410
What does it look like out there?

462
00:25:36.493 --> 00:25:37.327
Clear.

463
00:25:38.287 --> 00:25:40.122
But it's only a matter of time
before we're discovered.

464
00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:41.874
We need to figure out
our next move fast.

465
00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:44.543
Okay. This is a storage room
for junked equipment.

466
00:25:44.626 --> 00:25:46.837
So. let's look for anything
we can patch up and use.

467
00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.049
tools to get these bracelets off.
anything.

468
00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:51.717
Hold on.

469
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.638
-Captain. look.
-It's deactivated.

470
00:25:57.264 --> 00:25:58.223
How is that possible?

471
00:25:58.307 --> 00:26:00.601
Your powers work by mimicking the powers
in nearby metas. right?

472
00:26:00.684 --> 00:26:03.395
Yes. Whenever I'm in high stress
situations around other metas

473
00:26:03.479 --> 00:26:04.313
it just happens.

474
00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:06.982
For about 30 seconds.
I gain their powers. Why?

475
00:26:07.524 --> 00:26:10.277
These bracelets release RNA
energy pulses that repress meta genes.

476
00:26:10.903 --> 00:26:13.572
Your DNA is constantly morphing
based on your adrenal levels.

477
00:26:13.655 --> 00:26:15.157
and your proximity to other metas.

478
00:26:15.532 --> 00:26:18.035
The cuffs weren't designed
to handle erratic gene fluctuations.

479
00:26:18.118 --> 00:26:18.952
So--

480
00:26:19.036 --> 00:26:22.081
So. my mimic powers
short-circuited the bracelet.

481
00:26:23.332 --> 00:26:24.249
This is great.

482
00:26:24.333 --> 00:26:26.752
Okay. now you can mimic
Goldface's powers and take him down.

483
00:26:26.835 --> 00:26:27.711
He'll never see you coming.

484
00:26:27.795 --> 00:26:28.879
No. I am not ready for that.

485
00:26:30.339 --> 00:26:31.965
Why not? This is the chance
we've been waiting for.

486
00:26:32.049 --> 00:26:33.634
I said I can't do it. Allen.

487
00:26:33.717 --> 00:26:35.302
Let's just stick with your plan.

488
00:26:35.594 --> 00:26:36.720
Find something here that can help us.

489
00:26:36.804 --> 00:26:37.805
We don't have much time.

490
00:26:45.979 --> 00:26:49.483
Pardonne-moi. madame.
Room here for two to pay their tab?

491
00:26:49.608 --> 00:26:51.985
Don't want this fine establishment
to think I'm a thief.

492
00:26:53.529 --> 00:26:56.365
So. you disappear when people
want you to stick around.

493
00:26:56.448 --> 00:26:58.909
but you stick around
when people want you to disappear?

494
00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.995
I'm all kinds of complicated. Caitlin.

495
00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:05.999
Maybe that's why you can't see
how much we have in common.

496
00:27:08.001 --> 00:27:09.378
Yeah. believe it or not.

497
00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:12.005
both of us care about Frost.

498
00:27:12.089 --> 00:27:14.550
Yeah. and that's why you abandoned her.

499
00:27:16.718 --> 00:27:21.014
Fine. I screwed up before.
but Frost is special.

500
00:27:21.098 --> 00:27:22.891
and so I'm making up for it
as best I can.

501
00:27:22.975 --> 00:27:24.393
I'm even putting in time
with the family.

502
00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:26.311
Yeah. well.
what do you know about family?

503
00:27:27.187 --> 00:27:29.356
Uh. I know that mine's
dysfunctional as hell.

504
00:27:30.899 --> 00:27:32.985
And the way you went off in there.
you kind of reminded me of them.

505
00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:38.198
Yeah. you sounded just like
my frumpy. backstabbing nana.

506
00:27:38.448 --> 00:27:40.284
at every Blaine family reunion ever.

507
00:27:40.826 --> 00:27:42.077
I mean. talk about cold.

508
00:27:45.038 --> 00:27:47.291
Congratulations.
You actually gave me flashbacks.

509
00:27:51.003 --> 00:27:52.796
I'm sorry I blew up.

510
00:27:53.589 --> 00:27:56.008
But if you care about Frost
as much as you say you do.

511
00:27:56.091 --> 00:27:59.303
then you'll agree that she deserves
someone who--

512
00:27:59.386 --> 00:28:02.598
Accepts her. warts and all.
just like I do?

513
00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:09.313
Caitlin. like it or not.
Frost and I are all in.

514
00:28:09.938 --> 00:28:13.525
There is no holding back
or hiding pieces of ourselves.

515
00:28:14.276 --> 00:28:15.110
Like you.

516
00:28:15.611 --> 00:28:16.653
What are you talking about?

517
00:28:16.862 --> 00:28:19.615
Come on. I used to tend bar. remember?

518
00:28:20.657 --> 00:28:22.242
This isn't about Snowflake and I.

519
00:28:22.826 --> 00:28:25.162
This is about you
being more focused on hating me

520
00:28:25.245 --> 00:28:26.538
than focusing on your own date.

521
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.333
You've been holding back all night

522
00:28:30.209 --> 00:28:32.211
because you're afraid
to go all in with Marcus.

523
00:28:35.214 --> 00:28:36.048
Am I wrong?

524
00:28:41.053 --> 00:28:42.012
Look. it's...

525
00:28:43.972 --> 00:28:45.224
It's okay to be scared.

526
00:28:47.226 --> 00:28:48.852
But at some point
you've got to take a leap of faith

527
00:28:48.936 --> 00:28:51.146
like I did with Frost
and like she's doing with me.

528
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:56.610
Trust me. it's the best decision
that either of us have ever made.

529
00:28:57.027 --> 00:28:57.861
Hmm.

530
00:29:00.614 --> 00:29:01.907
And one more thing...

531
00:29:03.116 --> 00:29:05.494
Marcus is a really good guy.

532
00:29:07.371 --> 00:29:10.040
So maybe stop thinking about
what it is you have to lose

533
00:29:10.624 --> 00:29:12.376
and start thinking about what it is
you might gain.

534
00:29:12.459 --> 00:29:13.502
You know?

535
00:29:16.672 --> 00:29:17.547
Thanks.

536
00:29:18.006 --> 00:29:20.175
- For what?
- Gotta go.

537
00:29:34.731 --> 00:29:35.565
You find anything?

538
00:29:35.941 --> 00:29:36.858
No. not yet.

539
00:29:37.526 --> 00:29:38.443
Let's just keep looking.

540
00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:43.115
Captain. your powers are
our only hope of stopping Goldface.

541
00:29:43.365 --> 00:29:44.658
I told you. I can't.

542
00:29:45.158 --> 00:29:47.202
-Why not?
-Because I can't control them.

543
00:29:51.164 --> 00:29:54.543
Barry. the other day.
I ordered an iced coffee.

544
00:29:54.626 --> 00:29:57.045
but when I picked it up.
it boiled in my hand.

545
00:29:58.005 --> 00:29:59.923
Turns out the barista was a heat meta

546
00:30:00.007 --> 00:30:02.592
and I mimicked her powers
without even realizing it.

547
00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:05.304
Well. I...

548
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:08.807
I understand. but you can work
on controlling your powers.

549
00:30:09.016 --> 00:30:10.225
I have tried.

550
00:30:11.435 --> 00:30:15.439
But I can't figure it out.
and no one can teach me.

551
00:30:18.942 --> 00:30:22.321
That's why you've been so anxious
about getting in touch with the Flash?

552
00:30:24.114 --> 00:30:25.115
You want him to train you.

553
00:30:27.784 --> 00:30:30.245
Why didn't you just say
that was the reason earlier?

554
00:30:32.122 --> 00:30:34.082
Because it's hard for me
to ask for help.

555
00:30:34.958 --> 00:30:35.834
And...

556
00:30:39.588 --> 00:30:41.757
When I mimicked
that other meta's abilities.

557
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.634
if they had been more lethal.

558
00:30:44.718 --> 00:30:48.138
I could have killed someone without even
realizing what was happening.

559
00:30:49.598 --> 00:30:52.809
I was hoping Flash
could help me learn to control them.

560
00:30:53.685 --> 00:30:54.770
but he's out of reach.

561
00:30:57.022 --> 00:31:00.150
I am madness maddened.

562
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.277
Come out. come out.
wherever you are. Captain.

563
00:31:02.819 --> 00:31:03.779
Because if you don't

564
00:31:03.862 --> 00:31:06.448
I'm going to do this
the old-fashioned way

565
00:31:06.782 --> 00:31:10.535
and start squeezing your brave officers
until they pop.

566
00:31:12.496 --> 00:31:14.915
Two minutes. Captain. Tick-tock.

567
00:31:21.421 --> 00:31:23.048
Clock's ticking down. Captain.

568
00:31:23.465 --> 00:31:24.674
Captain. you have to go down there
right now.

569
00:31:24.758 --> 00:31:25.801
Don't you think I know that?

570
00:31:28.053 --> 00:31:30.263
Look. I did two tours
on a Kandaki battlefield.

571
00:31:30.347 --> 00:31:31.640
I am not afraid of dying.

572
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.852
And I won't let any more women
or men under my command get hurt.

573
00:31:35.936 --> 00:31:38.271
But. right now. I don't know
how to prevent that.

574
00:31:38.647 --> 00:31:39.856
You have to use your powers.

575
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.150
Look. I know you're worried
about losing control.

576
00:31:42.609 --> 00:31:45.153
but the military gave you
all the training you'll ever need

577
00:31:45.237 --> 00:31:46.863
to harness your own instincts.

578
00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.783
So. instead of worrying about trying
to control Goldface's powers.

579
00:31:49.908 --> 00:31:50.742
just letitin.

580
00:31:51.159 --> 00:31:54.287
Let it take over. and then go all in
on trusting your instincts.

581
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:56.540
Believe me. you can do this.

582
00:31:59.668 --> 00:32:02.254
Even if I could. what good would it do?

583
00:32:03.422 --> 00:32:05.465
It will give me the 30 seconds I need
to get this cuff off.

584
00:32:06.633 --> 00:32:08.385
- What?
- O Captain. my Captain.

585
00:32:08.468 --> 00:32:10.303
Just stall Goldface
until I can get us help.

586
00:32:10.387 --> 00:32:13.181
Barry. you saw what happens when someone
tries to take off that trinket.

587
00:32:13.265 --> 00:32:15.267
-Do you have a death wish?
-No. I can do this.

588
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.353
And you can handle Goldface.
You know why?

589
00:32:19.479 --> 00:32:21.356
You are one of the bravest people
I've ever met.

590
00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:28.738
Let's take back our house.

591
00:32:36.329 --> 00:32:37.414
I'm done playing. Captain.

592
00:32:38.165 --> 00:32:40.000
You've got 30 seconds
to give me what I want.

593
00:32:40.083 --> 00:32:41.042
or Officer...

594
00:32:41.835 --> 00:32:42.752
What's your name again?

595
00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:44.963
Korber.

596
00:32:46.506 --> 00:32:47.507
Is that with a C or with a K?

597
00:32:48.758 --> 00:32:50.635
-K.
-K. thanks.

598
00:32:51.636 --> 00:32:54.681
It's Bye. Felicia.
for Officer Korber here.

599
00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.642
And for every minute
I'm empty-handed after that.

600
00:32:58.351 --> 00:33:02.439
another person dies.

601
00:33:03.607 --> 00:33:04.441
Thirty.

602
00:33:05.066 --> 00:33:05.901
Twenty nine.

603
00:33:06.443 --> 00:33:08.862
Twenty eight. 27.

604
00:33:08.945 --> 00:33:12.449
Boss. you could just skip
the counting and kill her. you know.

605
00:33:14.034 --> 00:33:15.535
You have no sense of drama.

606
00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:19.915
Where was 1?

607
00:33:21.082 --> 00:33:23.293
Twenty seven. 26...

608
00:33:23.627 --> 00:33:25.629
Twenty six. 25...

609
00:33:25.712 --> 00:33:26.671
Let her go.

610
00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.429
You don't disappoint. Captain.

611
00:33:41.436 --> 00:33:42.354
What the hell!

612
00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:43.688
Give me back my chain.

613
00:33:44.105 --> 00:33:46.233
You want it? Take it from me.

614
00:33:50.737 --> 00:33:51.988
Why isn't your bracelet working?

615
00:33:53.823 --> 00:33:54.950
Didn't match my outfit.

616
00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:13.051
Wow. You have seriously leveled up.

617
00:34:47.377 --> 00:34:50.422
Looks like the chemist
wasn't so smart after all.

618
00:34:51.381 --> 00:34:52.591
That just leaves you.

619
00:34:53.592 --> 00:34:54.801
Time to bring the pain.

620
00:35:02.267 --> 00:35:03.602
Sorry I'm late. everyone.

621
00:35:05.353 --> 00:35:08.315
-Oh. my God. Allen. he must--
-No. he's okay.

622
00:35:08.857 --> 00:35:10.775
I got him out just in time.
thanks to you.

623
00:35:12.152 --> 00:35:14.654
Now. what were you thinking
breaking into a police station?

624
00:35:14.738 --> 00:35:16.197
Who's bad idea was that anyway?

625
00:35:20.118 --> 00:35:20.952
Seriously?

626
00:35:22.954 --> 00:35:23.872
What can I say?

627
00:35:24.456 --> 00:35:25.582
I'd do anything for love.

628
00:35:29.502 --> 00:35:30.587
One of you guys get this?

629
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.265
Take this evidence to Processing.

630
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:43.892
-You're late.
-Yeah. I know.

631
00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:45.352
-Again.
-I'm sorry.

632
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:46.811
You were amazing.

633
00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:48.438
You went toe to toe with Goldface.

634
00:35:49.022 --> 00:35:52.192
So I heard.
Uh. I mean. Korber told me all about it.

635
00:35:52.275 --> 00:35:54.861
Yeah. I held my own. long enough
for the Flash to arrive.

636
00:35:55.528 --> 00:35:58.531
Of course. he left before I got a chance
to say thank you. again.

637
00:35:58.615 --> 00:36:00.659
But at least I can thank you. Allen.

638
00:36:01.451 --> 00:36:04.663
I never could have stood up to Goldface
that way if it weren't for your advice.

639
00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:06.247
Oh. it was all you.

640
00:36:06.456 --> 00:36:08.750
I just aimed you in the right direction.

641
00:36:10.752 --> 00:36:14.297
By the way. I got to ask.
where are the meta-bullets anyway?

642
00:36:16.466 --> 00:36:19.511
I had them transferred to A.R.G.U.S.
35 weeks ago.

643
00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.472
And you kept that secret the whole time?

644
00:36:22.972 --> 00:36:24.182
Goldface was about to kill you.

645
00:36:24.391 --> 00:36:26.059
It's called a poker face. Allen.

646
00:36:28.895 --> 00:36:30.563
I should get started on the paperwork.

647
00:36:30.814 --> 00:36:32.649
At least this time
I know what the charges are.

648
00:36:45.203 --> 00:36:47.539
-Can we talk?
-Mark's downstairs.

649
00:36:47.706 --> 00:36:50.208
We have tickets to an underground rave
in Keystone City.

650
00:36:50.291 --> 00:36:52.001
It'll just take a minute. please.

651
00:36:53.586 --> 00:36:57.590
I acted like a total bonehead tonight.
and I was rude to you and to Mark.

652
00:36:57.674 --> 00:36:58.883
I am so sorry.

653
00:36:58.967 --> 00:37:00.760
Bonehead? Try "Jackass."

654
00:37:00.844 --> 00:37:02.095
What is your deal?

655
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:06.474
I guess I have a lot of baggage
to unpack when it comes to dating.

656
00:37:06.891 --> 00:37:07.767
You think?

657
00:37:09.477 --> 00:37:12.564
The reason I've been afraid
to go all in with Marcus is

658
00:37:13.022 --> 00:37:15.650
because the last time I did.
I lost everything.

659
00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:21.489
And I think that's why it's so hard
for me to see you with Mark.

660
00:37:22.031 --> 00:37:27.370
because I envy how honest and free
and effortless your relationship is.

661
00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:28.621
Effortless?

662
00:37:28.788 --> 00:37:29.914
I'm sorry.
That's not exactly what I call

663
00:37:29.998 --> 00:37:32.125
the roller coaster that is Frost-Blaine.

664
00:37:33.293 --> 00:37:35.170
You're aware I stabbed him. right?

665
00:37:36.963 --> 00:37:37.839
Yeah.

666
00:37:38.339 --> 00:37:39.924
You make it seem easy. at least.

667
00:37:40.842 --> 00:37:43.303
And Mark helped me realize something.

668
00:37:45.054 --> 00:37:47.265
Mark? My Mark?

669
00:37:47.682 --> 00:37:48.683
Yeah.

670
00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:51.811
Mark showed me that if I'm gonna have
a chance at finding the same thing.

671
00:37:51.895 --> 00:37:56.399
then I need to take
the same leap with Dr. Ficus.

672
00:37:57.275 --> 00:37:58.234
So I'm gonna do it.

673
00:37:58.693 --> 00:38:02.238
Hmm. That's great. I'm happy for you.

674
00:38:02.363 --> 00:38:03.990
Thank you.
And I'm happy for you and Mark.

675
00:38:04.783 --> 00:38:08.203
Even though. he is himself.

676
00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:13.208
So does this mean we can do
that whole double date thing for reals?

677
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:16.711
I need to patch things up with Marcus.
but. after that. I'd love to.

678
00:38:17.545 --> 00:38:18.505
Great.

679
00:38:19.214 --> 00:38:21.090
Mark and I signed up
for a roller derby on the weekend.

680
00:38:21.174 --> 00:38:22.926
and we need two extra players.

681
00:38:23.009 --> 00:38:24.969
So. you have a mouth guard. right?

682
00:38:26.763 --> 00:38:30.683
Uh. I could probably find one. maybe.

683
00:38:31.017 --> 00:38:33.394
Cool. Practice starts
tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.

684
00:38:33.478 --> 00:38:34.395
Don't be late.

685
00:38:47.075 --> 00:38:48.743
Love what you've done with the place.

686
00:38:48.827 --> 00:38:49.744
It's...

687
00:38:50.203 --> 00:38:52.288
It's different than the last captain's.

688
00:38:52.705 --> 00:38:57.544
Flash. on behalf of this
whole department. I wanted to thank you.

689
00:38:58.753 --> 00:39:00.505
We couldn't have stopped Goldface
without you.

690
00:39:00.964 --> 00:39:02.423
Hey. if it wasn't for
your smart thinking.

691
00:39:02.507 --> 00:39:04.008
a lot of people
would have been seriously hurt.

692
00:39:05.426 --> 00:39:07.846
So. from now on. if you need me.

693
00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.098
you can call me on this.

694
00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.686
If we're going to keep this city safe.
we need to do it together.

695
00:39:16.229 --> 00:39:18.940
Which is why I want to share
something else with you.

696
00:39:20.149 --> 00:39:21.067
My true identity.

697
00:39:22.902 --> 00:39:24.195
Allen. I know it's you.

698
00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:27.907
Wait. what?

699
00:39:29.284 --> 00:39:30.368
How did you find out?

700
00:39:31.077 --> 00:39:33.413
I found this charred bracelet
in the storage room.

701
00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:35.874
There is only one way

702
00:39:35.957 --> 00:39:38.042
you could have escaped
a bomb exploding on your wrist.

703
00:39:39.127 --> 00:39:39.961
Super speed.

704
00:39:43.715 --> 00:39:45.049
You know. Joe was right all along.

705
00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:47.385
You really are a great cop.

706
00:39:49.679 --> 00:39:53.766
And I'd be more than happy to train you
to become an even better meta.

707
00:40:08.114 --> 00:40:09.949
Since when do you know
how to make a Doro Wat?

708
00:40:10.742 --> 00:40:13.328
Did you spend a year in Ethiopia
that I don't know about or--

709
00:40:13.411 --> 00:40:15.955
It's called retirement.

710
00:40:16.039 --> 00:40:18.750
I am learning to cook whatever I want.

711
00:40:19.584 --> 00:40:22.337
Of course. all your little sister
wants to eat is chicken nuggets.

712
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.630
Hey. don't knock the nuggies.

713
00:40:24.047 --> 00:40:25.131
I should check on her.

714
00:40:25.214 --> 00:40:27.800
and make sure she's still asleep
and not trying to make a break for it.

715
00:40:27.884 --> 00:40:28.718
Mm.

716
00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.347
Yeah. I'm gonna pack Barr
some leftovers. He's working late.

717
00:40:33.556 --> 00:40:36.643
But. first. I am going to have
a little bit more.

718
00:40:47.403 --> 00:40:48.237
Dad.

719
00:40:49.405 --> 00:40:50.239
Uh...

720
00:40:50.406 --> 00:40:51.950
Uh. weren't you just upstairs?

721
00:40:53.409 --> 00:40:54.285
Yeah.

722
00:40:54.786 --> 00:40:58.873
and then I went to the garage
because you asked me to get the files

723
00:40:58.957 --> 00:41:00.375
from the old Scarpola case.

724
00:41:01.876 --> 00:41:02.794
Remember?

725
00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:05.004
Um...

726
00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:08.925
Yeah. I must have just
checked out for a second.

727
00:41:09.467 --> 00:41:10.969
Mm. I get it.

728
00:41:11.594 --> 00:41:13.096
That's a food coma. baby girl.

729
00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:22.120
