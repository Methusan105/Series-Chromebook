﻿1
00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:08.300
Hasta mafiana. Stan.

2
00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:10.177
Have a good one.

3
00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.273
Donna?

4
00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:34.701
If you're trying to scare me.
it won't work.

5
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:38.038
I told you I ain't paying you
a damn cent more.

6
00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.512
Come on. man. That's enough.

7
00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:29.673
Ooh!

8
00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:32.301
-Fresh java. Thank you. baby.
-Yeah.

9
00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:35.387
Hey. I was thinking that we could get
an early dinner reservation tonight.

10
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.764
Sure.

11
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:45.606
Actually. um.

12
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.068
you know what? Why don't we stay in.
have a quiet night. just the two of us?

13
00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:51.695
That feels better--

14
00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.155
Thank you. I'm okay.

15
00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:56.116
You know. I got to get
used to it eventually.

16
00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:57.159
It's just another day.

17
00:01:57.326 --> 00:01:58.702
I can clear my schedule.

18
00:01:58.785 --> 00:01:59.786
I'm fine. really.

19
00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:02.539
Besides. things are...
things are busy at CCC.

20
00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:03.582
You need to be there.

21
00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:06.460
And I need to get to work.

22
00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:08.587
I'm just a phone call away.

23
00:02:10.047 --> 00:02:10.922
I know.

24
00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:22.684
Is it that bad?

25
00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:27.439
Sorry. The fire
just kinda weirds me out. is all.

26
00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:31.443
The vic's name is Stanley Mullen.

27
00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:35.906
Uh... He's the manager
of this local watering hole.

28
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.699
That's weird.

29
00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:41.578
The body's burnt through. but the ground
underneath isn't even charred.

30
00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:44.122
Yeah. this was definitely a meta attack.

31
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.708
Dark matter levels are off the charts.

32
00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:50.712
Whoever the meta is. they produce fire
that ignores the laws of physics.

33
00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:52.547
Oh. man. Now this is giving me.

34
00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:57.427
like. Goodbye-Armageddon-But-Hello-
Dante's-Inferno type of vibe.

35
00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.263
- Morning. Allen. Runk.
- Morning.

36
00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:03.141
Find anything that can help us
piece this together?

37
00:03:04.393 --> 00:03:07.729
Uh. no. not yet.
Were there any witnesses?

38
00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.524
The bartender. Donna Winters.
didn't see the crime.

39
00:03:10.941 --> 00:03:14.152
but. she said our victim got into
a pretty nasty argument last night

40
00:03:14.236 --> 00:03:16.279
with a recently paroled ex-convict.

41
00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:17.864
Apparently. the guy had a bad temper.

42
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.912
Oh. and he was wearing a Lips concert
t-shirt. You know. as in the rock band.

43
00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:27.749
I was gonna ask her
some follow up questions.

44
00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:30.627
Would it be okay if I.
um. showed her a picture

45
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:32.129
of someone who could be our suspect?

46
00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:33.547
Sure.

47
00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:42.389
Donna. this is CSI Barry Allen
and C.C.P.D. Consultant. Chester Runk.

48
00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.768
Miss Winters. the person you saw arguing
with the victim. was this him?

49
00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:51.022
That's him. That's the guy.

50
00:03:51.857 --> 00:03:54.651
Jaco Birch. I'll put out an APB.

51
00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:56.528
This way. ma'am.

52
00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:00.323
The Hotness did this?

53
00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:04.327
I thought it was all about the moolah.
not cold-blooded murder.

54
00:04:04.995 --> 00:04:07.789
Plus. how do you kill someone
without burning half the place down?

55
00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:10.876
Looks like we're not
the only ones who leveled up this year.

56
00:04:18.175 --> 00:04:20.802
Here you go. boss lady.
This is every suggestion

57
00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:24.598
the Bullpen brainstormed for who should
be our first CC Citizen of the Week.

58
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:25.640
Nice work.

59
00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:29.269
Only. this is every suggestion...

60
00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:31.772
except the winning one.

61
00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:34.900
-Rosie Levin?
-Hmm?

62
00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:39.863
Uh... Boss. I don't think launching
our first profile section

63
00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:43.742
on some shallow social media influencer
is the way to go.

64
00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:46.787
I just thought we were supposed to be
the voice of the people.

65
00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:48.413
I hear you.

66
00:04:48.497 --> 00:04:51.458
But Rosie Levin is who
the people are interested in.

67
00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:53.794
Five hundred thousand of them.
to be exact.

68
00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:55.796
And if we can bring those eyeballs
to CCC.

69
00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.590
then. hopefully. people will read
the stories that matter.

70
00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:05.430
Is there something
that you want to tell me?

71
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.183
Yeah. Okay. fine.

72
00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:12.187
Taylor brought this to me earlier.
and I told her it wasn't right for us.

73
00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:14.481
And she went behind my back.

74
00:05:15.524 --> 00:05:19.027
She believed in the story.
and she followed protocol

75
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.321
and made an appeal
to the editor-in-chief.

76
00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:22.364
And I approved it.

77
00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:23.949
Is that a problem?

78
00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:26.326
Yes. I mean. no.

79
00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:30.664
I just mean if the Bullpen
knows they can come to you

80
00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:33.667
when I say no. my word means nothing.

81
00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.461
Look. you're still their boss.

82
00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:38.797
But I'm also yours.

83
00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:42.551
And that means that sometimes
we are going to disagree on the stories

84
00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:44.469
that we tell.
It's a part of the process.

85
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.722
Yeah. you're right. Of course. I...

86
00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:52.352
Actually. you know what?
Why don't you both interview Rosie?

87
00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.355
You want Taylor and me to work together?

88
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.024
You are my Supervising Editor.
Go supervise.

89
00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:01.361
Plus. opposing perspectives
make for better stories.

90
00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:04.281
And keep an open mind. I mean. you might

91
00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:06.449
be surprised at what the two of you
can do together.

92
00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:10.036
Yeah. You got it.

93
00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:24.009
Whoa. whoa.
Easy with the guitars. roadies.

94
00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:27.262
You're unloading the gilded weapons
of true rock gods. Come on.

95
00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:29.973
Trust your old man. Harold.

96
00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:32.642
Watching the Lips concert
is gonna blow your freaking mind.

97
00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:33.727
Yeah. Whatever. dude.

98
00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:35.353
Hey. I'm sorry I couldn't land

99
00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:37.397
the backstage passes
I promised. All right?

100
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.025
I kind of ran into
a little bit of a cash flow issue.

101
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.485
You bribe me here with stuff
you couldn't even get. Jaco.

102
00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:44.613
Even more lame than usual.

103
00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:48.533
I know. right?

104
00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:53.580
But. uh. hey. look. maybe after
the show. we could grab some food. Huh?

105
00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:55.957
I could tell you some stories
about these crazy things

106
00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:57.584
these bands I'm working with get into.

107
00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:01.713
You aren't with the bands. Jaco. You're
arena security. Anyone can do that.

108
00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:04.507
I'm gonna go for a walk.

109
00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:09.846
Look... Look. Harold...

110
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:12.724
Whoa.

111
00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:21.316
Jaco Birch. you're under arrest
for the murder of Stanley Mullen.

112
00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:23.318
I think you got the wrong guy.

113
00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:24.569
What's going on?

114
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.154
Take him somewhere safe.

115
00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:27.280
Hey--

116
00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:28.823
Let go of me. jerk.

117
00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:30.575
Hey. hey. hey.
Get your hands off my son!

118
00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:32.744
Calm down and put your hands
behind your back.

119
00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:35.705
Nobody's taking my kid away from me.

120
00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:37.874
Never again!

121
00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:50.553
Thanks. Flash. We've got it from here.

122
00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:54.933
Harold. I'm innocent. I swear.
I'm innocent.

123
00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:56.101
Please. believe me.

124
00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:57.519
Flash. you've got to help me. Please.

125
00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:58.603
I didn't do anything.

126
00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:00.897
Please! I can't lose my son! Please.

127
00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.442
I didn't do this. I swear to God.
I didn't do this.

128
00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:06.403
-Where's Mom?
-What's going to happen to my son?

129
00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:07.821
-Dad!
-Barry!

130
00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:08.738
Dad!

131
00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:11.658
Harold. I didn't do anything. I swear.

132
00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:13.994
I swear. Please. believe me. Please!

133
00:08:14.018 --> 00:08:16.018
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

134
00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:30.593
Okay. I got to be honest.

135
00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:33.346
Eh... Based on these police reports.

136
00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:36.516
I'd advise Mr. Birch here to start
thinking about a plea bargain.

137
00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:38.601
Okay.

138
00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:44.357
I'm guessing you feel differently.

139
00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.860
l... I just want to make sure
they got the right guy.

140
00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:48.278
Well. it seems like they do.

141
00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:50.989
He had an argument with the victim
hours before he was killed.

142
00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:52.157
He's got no alibi.

143
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.659
The crime matches his powers.
and the guy is an ex-con.

144
00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:57.495
Who was released early
for good behavior.

145
00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:59.456
Korber and those other officers

146
00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.374
could have been killed. too.
if you hadn't intervened.

147
00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:04.002
I know how it looks for Birch.

148
00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:07.213
but there isn't any hard evidence
that he's guilty.

149
00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.674
And last night.
he supposedly killed a man.

150
00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:12.427
And then. instead of laying low.
he went back to work this morning?

151
00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:14.471
As a security guard. of all things?

152
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.473
It's just-- It doesn't add up.

153
00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:18.516
Yeah. Stranger things have happened.

154
00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:23.146
I know. Look. I've worked
hundreds of cases like this.

155
00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:26.274
and I'm telling you something about this

156
00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:28.193
just-- it doesn't feel right to me.

157
00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:33.073
Okay. Okay. but you know
that Birch had motive

158
00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:34.991
and opportunity to commit this murder.

159
00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:38.244
You didn't see the look on his face
when they took him from his son.

160
00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:40.705
He was...

161
00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:44.834
He was begging for me
to believe that he's innocent.

162
00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:46.503
And you do.

163
00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:48.755
I'm not sure yet.

164
00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:54.177
Look. would you be willing
to meet with him?

165
00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:56.179
To get a read on his emotions?

166
00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:02.102
Yes. of course. I'll meet with him.

167
00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:04.562
Guilty or not.
everyone deserves proper representation.

168
00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:05.605
But. Barry...

169
00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:10.026
using my powers to read a client?

170
00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:13.488
It's an ethical line that I can't cross.

171
00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.240
Yeah. of course. I'm sorry. I...

172
00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:18.451
I just don't want to see someone

173
00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:21.121
go to prison for a murder
they might not have committed.

174
00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:27.043
So. Rosie.

175
00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:31.047
dropping out of Cornell to become
a social media influencer took guts.

176
00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:34.551
What inspired you
to make such a bold decision?

177
00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:38.263
Let's just say
institutionalized learning

178
00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.223
felt like a total prison.

179
00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:41.766
Uh! Mm-hmm.

180
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.893
Trust me. it's not.

181
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:46.771
What my supervisor means

182
00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:51.276
is that our readers are just so eager
to get to know the real Rosie Levin.

183
00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:53.611
So sorry. Will you excuse me?

184
00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:55.071
Uh...

185
00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:58.241
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what her problem is.

186
00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:01.661
Uh. now. uh. why don't you take me
through a typical day?

187
00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:05.123
Lydia.

188
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.168
Garcia.

189
00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:14.007
Oh. my God. it's so good to see you.
How are you?

190
00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:18.386
Well. look who decided to come say hi.

191
00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:22.515
I haven't seen you since Iron Heights.
At least. not in person.

192
00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:25.935
Then. again. your face is plastered
all over that news website.

193
00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:30.398
CCC Media. Yeah. I... I work there now.

194
00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:34.027
These days. I'm writing the headlines.
not starring in them.

195
00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:35.278
Must be nice.

196
00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:41.451
So. you've been working here
since you got out?

197
00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:46.247
No. Um. my first gig was cleaning out
porta potties. That was fun.

198
00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:50.585
I guess this is kind of like
a promotion for me.

199
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:52.962
Not that you care.

200
00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:54.505
What's that supposed to mean?

201
00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:57.050
I get it. You're too busy
to help out old friends.

202
00:11:57.383 --> 00:12:00.011
You're mad because I'm a reporter now?

203
00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:04.557
Look. You got out. walked into
a legit career. Good for you.

204
00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:09.062
Meanwhile. I busted my butt
to get my GED in prison

205
00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:10.396
and look where it got me.

206
00:12:12.023 --> 00:12:15.443
This is just temporary.
I mean. I'm sure you can do better.

207
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.404
Gee. thanks.

208
00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:19.822
I didn't mean it like that.

209
00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:20.865
I know what you meant.

210
00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:25.245
The truth is. cleaning floors
is the best job I can get

211
00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:26.579
with a record like mine.

212
00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:30.750
People like you don't see
who I'm trying to be. only who I was.

213
00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:33.711
Makes it really hard. you know.

214
00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:36.631
No. I don't know.

215
00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:42.470
Not yet. But...
I'd like to try and help you.

216
00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:44.597
How could you possibly help me?

217
00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:47.976
Let me share your story with the world.

218
00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:51.896
Trust me.

219
00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:00.113
Before we get into this.
I need to know my son's okay.

220
00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:01.823
The cops won't tell me anything.

221
00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:02.824
Yeah. Harold is fine.

222
00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:05.285
He's with Social Services
just until they can track down his mom.

223
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.787
Good luck with that.
She's been in and out of his life

224
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.123
since he was born.
No telling when she'll turn up again.

225
00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:14.252
Harold's mother. she took care of him
while you were in Iron Heights. right?

226
00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:15.378
Barely.

227
00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:18.798
That's why I got my act together
and got the hell out of that place.

228
00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:23.469
But Harold. he never forgave me for
abandoning him. and I don't blame him.

229
00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:27.432
Every second of the four years
I spent in that prison.

230
00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:29.392
it was like he was serving time. too.

231
00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:33.855
The thing is. Harold's a good kid.

232
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.775
I don't know what he did
to deserve a father like me.

233
00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:42.196
Okay. Why don't you tell me
what happened last night?

234
00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.324
Stan and I got into it at the bar.

235
00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:46.451
I sold him a guitar
so I could buy Harold

236
00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:48.119
backstage passes to the Lips concert.

237
00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:51.622
And. at the last minute. Stan decided to
only pay me half of what we agreed on.

238
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.124
Then what happened?

239
00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:55.001
Sure. we argued.

240
00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:58.546
And. yeah. I told him this wasn't over.
But then I went home.

241
00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:01.090
That's the last I saw of Stan.

242
00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:02.967
Is there anybody that can confirm that?

243
00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:05.261
Anybody? Was your son home
with you last night?

244
00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:06.596
No. he was out with friends.

245
00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:08.765
So. unless my vinyl collection
can talk...

246
00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:11.726
I got nothing.

247
00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:17.857
All right.

248
00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:21.486
Listen. I've been around long enough
to know

249
00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:23.321
you're about to tell me I'm screwed.

250
00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:27.492
But I'm telling you. I'm innocent.

251
00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:32.830
Jaco. the bartender
places you at the scene

252
00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:34.415
moments before the crime.

253
00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:37.502
Any jury is going to see that

254
00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:39.587
as more than enough evidence to convict.

255
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.588
No!

256
00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:44.675
I won't leave my son
without a dad again. okay?

257
00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.135
You got that?

258
00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:51.224
Look. I wish I had
something better to tell you. Barry.

259
00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:56.229
but Birch just doesn't have the pieces
that you need to build a strong defense.

260
00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:59.857
and all of the evidence. it's still
pointing to him as the killer.

261
00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:02.527
I... I know you didn't use
your abilities in there.

262
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.278
but what does your gut tell you?

263
00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:08.658
It's telling me that whether
he is actually innocent or not.

264
00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:12.370
he definitely believes that he is.

265
00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:15.331
But it's not nearly enough.

266
00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:19.168
Yeah. but look. if there is any chance
he is innocent. we have to help him.

267
00:15:25.007 --> 00:15:25.883
What's going on?

268
00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:29.178
Jaco Birch just escaped custody
en route to holding.

269
00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:31.222
-Was anybody hurt?
-Thankfully. no.

270
00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:33.474
But so much for
his "I'm innocent" sob story. huh?

271
00:15:45.903 --> 00:15:47.697
You told the cops I killed Stan?

272
00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:50.616
Come on. man.
I only told them what I saw.

273
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.828
And when you think about it.
I really didn't see anything.

274
00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:56.873
Hey. you and me are... are good. right?

275
00:15:56.956 --> 00:16:00.501
I'm gonna lose my son because of you.
Because of what you said!

276
00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:03.254
Hey. man. relax.
Maybe I didn't see anything.

277
00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:06.716
Damn straight.
‘cause you're gonna take it back.

278
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.011
You're gonna take it all back right now!

279
00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:11.721
Wait. man. please!

280
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:20.771
-Nothing on the satellites yet.
-Okay. keep trying.

281
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.232
We have to figure out where Birch
is going before C.C.P.D. does.

282
00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:25.359
It's the only way we'll have a chance
to prove he's innocent.

283
00:16:25.526 --> 00:16:27.653
I'm sorry. are we talking about the guy
who just burned his way

284
00:16:27.737 --> 00:16:29.822
through a C.C.P.D. transport convoy?

285
00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:32.408
The fact that Birch ran away
doesn't change the evidence.

286
00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:34.869
There's still nothing directly tying him
to Mullen's death.

287
00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:40.291
Sure. Barry. sure. but fleeing custody
is not exactly exculpatory.

288
00:16:40.374 --> 00:16:41.751
And I'm saying that as his lawyer.

289
00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:44.921
She's right. Barr.
if Jaco Birch is innocent. why run?

290
00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:47.507
Why did Frost run
when Chillblaine framed her?

291
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.842
Because. unfortunately.
sometimes people don't get a fair shot

292
00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:51.010
from the justice system.

293
00:16:51.719 --> 00:16:53.763
Yeah. and. as a former DA. I know.

294
00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:56.474
I know that sometimes it's true.
they don't.

295
00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:59.685
Okay. but how do we know Birch isn't
the same hothead he's always been?

296
00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:01.604
I mean. he'd be halfway across
the country by now.

297
00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:03.606
No. he didn't skip town.
Not without his son.

298
00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:04.899
And you know this how?

299
00:17:04.982 --> 00:17:07.193
-I just do.
-Okay.

300
00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:11.405
Uh. guys. emergency dispatch
is getting calls about a fire

301
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.741
right outside O'Shaughnessy's.

302
00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:14.700
What?

303
00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:16.953
Why would Birch go back
to the scene of the crime?

304
00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:17.912
If it's really Birch.

305
00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:20.248
Yeah. I'll find out.

306
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.378
I'll go with you for backup.

307
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.425
Holy crap.

308
00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:41.644
What kind of fire is this?

309
00:17:43.354 --> 00:17:44.814
I think I know who this is.

310
00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:48.901
Is that the witness who pinned it
on Birch? The bartender?

311
00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:54.073
You know. your innocent man. Barr.
is not looking so innocent anymore.

312
00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:02.540
I thought we were supposed
to be working together on this.

313
00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:05.501
Next time. Right now. I am in the zone.

314
00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:08.421
I thought I saw you two were back.
How'd the interview go?

315
00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:12.300
Great. I feel like the story
is exploding out of me.

316
00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:15.303
So. everything went well?

317
00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:18.097
Yeah. Peachy.

318
00:18:18.639 --> 00:18:21.642
Seriously. you're gonna love
what I'm doing here. I promise.

319
00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:25.187
Excuse me.
I just need to get some air.

320
00:18:28.899 --> 00:18:30.651
All right.
Well. I'll let you get back to it.

321
00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:32.695
I'm looking forward
to reading the finished product.

322
00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:34.614
Roger that.

323
00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:40.077
I got back the tomography reports
from the crime lab.

324
00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:42.622
Donna Winters. the bartender who died.

325
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.459
the thermal lesions on her body match
the marks on Stan Mullen's body exactly.

326
00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:47.627
Too exactly.

327
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.338
I mean. there's no pyrokinetic meta
who could replicate burns like that

328
00:18:50.421 --> 00:18:51.422
even if they tried.

329
00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:54.592
l... I... I told you. Something about
Birch's case just wasn't adding up.

330
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.427
Barry. we're the ones who told Birch

331
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.054
that Donna blamed him
for the first murder

332
00:18:58.137 --> 00:18:59.221
and now Donna is dead.

333
00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:00.681
She's dead.

334
00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:02.558
You have gotta see
how that looks. right?

335
00:19:02.683 --> 00:19:05.061
Yeah. but the facts are still
on Birch's side.

336
00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:08.022
Neither crime scene
has any direct evidence tying him to it.

337
00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:10.316
No DNA. no fingerprints. no withesses--

338
00:19:10.441 --> 00:19:11.817
That are still alive.

339
00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:15.404
Barry. you gotta admit.
Birch has motive.

340
00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:20.618
And the more emotional he gets.
the stronger his powers are.

341
00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:23.704
Like. you know. earth-shattering.

342
00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:25.665
Thank goodness
he wasn't in a bad mood today.

343
00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:26.999
That doesn't make him a killer.

344
00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:31.212
Okay. look. we know that you're just

345
00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:33.047
trying to do the right thing here.
we do.

346
00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:38.177
But. Barry. we can't help but wonder if
just maybe you're not thinking clearly

347
00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:39.470
about this case.

348
00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:42.223
Oh. so that's it.

349
00:19:43.057 --> 00:19:46.769
You've already decided.
You're giving up on him.

350
00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:49.647
No. we're just looking at
the facts. man.

351
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:50.731
Soam I.

352
00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:54.110
And two exact fire signatures
makes me think Birch is not our guy.

353
00:19:55.361 --> 00:19:56.987
Chester. could you please
at least take a look at this

354
00:19:57.071 --> 00:19:58.030
and see what you can find?

355
00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:03.536
Yeah. okay.

356
00:20:04.078 --> 00:20:06.664
Look. I know that you've all thought
Birch was guilty from the start--

357
00:20:06.747 --> 00:20:08.165
No. we haven't.
That's not true.

358
00:20:08.499 --> 00:20:11.419
Each of us have been trying
to help him from the beginning.

359
00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:12.878
But then Birch ran off.

360
00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:14.588
He was just trying to protect his son.

361
00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:17.007
What about other suspects?

362
00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:18.259
There are none.

363
00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:21.846
Both victims worked at O'Shaughnessy's.

364
00:20:22.596 --> 00:20:26.016
Maybe they. uh. owed somebody money
or pissed off the wrong person.

365
00:20:26.517 --> 00:20:30.688
I... I get Birch is a known fire-meta
and an ex-con.

366
00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:32.606
That also makes him
the perfect fall guy.

367
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.358
Okay. now you think he's being framed.

368
00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:35.526
I'm saying it's possible.

369
00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:38.988
Look. Birch is the freaking Hotness
and a bad guy.

370
00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:40.281
It feels like he's changed.

371
00:20:40.448 --> 00:20:41.449
Not to us.

372
00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:43.826
And. honestly.
it feels like you're asking us

373
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:45.369
to believe in something impossible.

374
00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:46.370
Yeah. I am.

375
00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:50.207
'Cause if anyone had when I was a kid.
my dad wouldn't have gone to jail.

376
00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:53.586
Barry.

377
00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:56.088
Barry. honey.

378
00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:58.007
Look. we're-- We're sorry.

379
00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.759
We weren't thinking.

380
00:20:59.842 --> 00:21:00.926
Look. here's the deal.

381
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.179
I believe Birch is innocent.

382
00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:06.348
So. with or without your help.

383
00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:09.310
I'm gonna do everything
within my power to clear his name.

384
00:21:23.032 --> 00:21:24.533
That looks familiar.

385
00:21:26.535 --> 00:21:30.956
It's been. what. seven. eight years
since I've seen this board.

386
00:21:31.749 --> 00:21:35.002
Except. the last time it was covered
with photos of a different man.

387
00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:38.964
Cecile told me what happened.

388
00:21:40.758 --> 00:21:41.967
The team is worried about you.

389
00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:43.636
No. they don't have to be. I'm fine.

390
00:21:43.844 --> 00:21:44.845
No. you're not.

391
00:21:46.847 --> 00:21:48.474
They don't know what today is.

392
00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:50.059
I do.

393
00:21:51.352 --> 00:21:54.688
February 1st. Henry's birthday.

394
00:22:02.446 --> 00:22:06.700
You remember. when he was turning 45...

395
00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:10.079
and your mom threw that surprise party?

396
00:22:10.621 --> 00:22:15.876
The whole block showed up.
and you were baking cupcakes for weeks.

397
00:22:16.585 --> 00:22:19.922
And when the big night came.
before he can even take off his coat...

398
00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:22.091
his pager went off.

399
00:22:22.591 --> 00:22:23.968
A patient needed him.

400
00:22:25.302 --> 00:22:26.554
He had to miss his own party.

401
00:22:26.929 --> 00:22:30.766
And you were disappointed.
of course. but you understood.

402
00:22:32.476 --> 00:22:35.312
He was helping save
people's lives. right?

403
00:22:35.813 --> 00:22:36.814
Yeah.

404
00:22:38.774 --> 00:22:42.403
But Henry. he was crushed.

405
00:22:43.237 --> 00:22:46.866
He was worried that he was missing
all these moments

406
00:22:47.241 --> 00:22:48.951
with you and your mom.

407
00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:51.078
But I told him.

408
00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:54.123
"Those cupcakes might be stale now.

409
00:22:56.292 --> 00:23:01.589
but... you'll have more birthdays
with both of them."

410
00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:02.882
Only. there weren't.

411
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.468
That was the last one
before it happened.

412
00:23:06.802 --> 00:23:07.970
-Barry!
-Dad!

413
00:23:08.137 --> 00:23:09.179
Stay out of the house!

414
00:23:10.347 --> 00:23:11.181
Barry!

415
00:23:11.724 --> 00:23:14.852
Joe. the look in my dad's eyes
that night...

416
00:23:17.146 --> 00:23:19.690
it was the same look in Birch's eyes
when they arrested him.

417
00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:27.156
Look of an innocent man
desperate not to lose his son.

418
00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:30.576
Begging someone to believe him.

419
00:23:31.368 --> 00:23:32.369
And you do?

420
00:23:33.537 --> 00:23:34.538
Yeah. I do.

421
00:23:35.414 --> 00:23:37.833
I just keep thinking about
all the time my dad lost.

422
00:23:39.293 --> 00:23:42.087
All the birthdays we spent
separated by Plexiglas.

423
00:23:44.924 --> 00:23:47.509
I can't let Birch and his son
go through that if he's innocent.

424
00:23:51.347 --> 00:23:52.556
I don't know. maybe the team's right.

425
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.558
Maybe I'm making something
out of nothing.

426
00:23:57.394 --> 00:23:59.647
Do you think maybe I've had blinders up
this whole time?

427
00:24:00.481 --> 00:24:01.357
Maybe.

428
00:24:01.732 --> 00:24:02.650
Or...

429
00:24:04.735 --> 00:24:06.236
you can see something they can't.

430
00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:08.197
Look...

431
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:11.659
what you went through.
I wouldn't wish on anyone.

432
00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:20.834
But what it did was it gave you
the ability to believe in the underdog

433
00:24:22.211 --> 00:24:24.713
when no one else is willing to.

434
00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:28.968
So...

435
00:24:31.303 --> 00:24:33.138
if your gut tells you...

436
00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:37.351
to not give up on Birch...

437
00:24:39.895 --> 00:24:43.023
then. for Henry's sake. don't.

438
00:24:46.527 --> 00:24:47.528
Not yet.

439
00:25:00.207 --> 00:25:02.167
So. what do you think?

440
00:25:05.879 --> 00:25:08.215
I think the lede is in the second graph.
not the first.

441
00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:12.761
But. besides that. it is a very engaging

442
00:25:13.262 --> 00:25:14.555
and beautifully written article.

443
00:25:15.014 --> 00:25:16.640
I think it's gonna open a lot of eyes.

444
00:25:17.307 --> 00:25:18.350
Seriously. you like it?

445
00:25:18.642 --> 00:25:19.560
Yes. I do.

446
00:25:20.227 --> 00:25:21.854
But. Allegra.
as strong as that article is.

447
00:25:21.937 --> 00:25:23.397
that's not what I assigned you.

448
00:25:24.023 --> 00:25:28.485
I know.
but I have a unique insight into Lydia.

449
00:25:28.569 --> 00:25:31.321
and me connecting with the story so much

450
00:25:31.405 --> 00:25:33.449
is what's gonna make it connect
with our audience.

451
00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:34.366
Agreed.

452
00:25:34.658 --> 00:25:37.995
But I wanted you to make this special

453
00:25:38.245 --> 00:25:39.663
and to help support a colleague.

454
00:25:39.788 --> 00:25:42.750
There's some decent writing in Taylor's
article. but it's all surface.

455
00:25:42.833 --> 00:25:43.667
There's no context.

456
00:25:43.751 --> 00:25:47.212
There's no examination
of Rosie's influence on young women.

457
00:25:48.422 --> 00:25:50.299
Allegra. you could have made
this story so much better

458
00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:52.092
if you would have helped her.
like I asked you to do.

459
00:25:52.176 --> 00:25:54.470
Yeah. Iris. I'm so sorry.

460
00:25:56.055 --> 00:25:58.307
The interview with Rosie.
it wasn't going anywhere.

461
00:25:58.557 --> 00:25:59.683
So. you abandoned it?

462
00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.560
I followed my instinct.

463
00:26:01.769 --> 00:26:04.188
l... thought that's what
you'd want me to do.

464
00:26:04.271 --> 00:26:07.024
What I want is for you to learn
how to be a supervisor.

465
00:26:07.107 --> 00:26:09.818
That's why I'm trying to teach you
how to mentor her.

466
00:26:10.486 --> 00:26:11.987
Instead. you did just the opposite.

467
00:26:13.489 --> 00:26:17.201
But... I have an obligation
to our readers

468
00:26:17.284 --> 00:26:19.536
to publish the best articles that I can.

469
00:26:20.662 --> 00:26:25.250
and your profile on Lydia is amazing.

470
00:26:25.751 --> 00:26:27.753
I think it's gonna start
an important conversation.

471
00:26:28.003 --> 00:26:31.090
So. we're gonna go with it.

472
00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:35.594
But. next time. please run
any changes this big by me first.

473
00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.472
And another thing.
I want you to talk to Taylor.

474
00:26:40.099 --> 00:26:41.141
You're her immediate boss.

475
00:26:41.225 --> 00:26:44.353
so it's up to you to fix this.
not the other way around.

476
00:26:48.982 --> 00:26:50.025
Chester. what'd you find?

477
00:26:50.109 --> 00:26:51.985
-You were right.
-Yeah. check this out.

478
00:26:52.069 --> 00:26:54.780
So. I cross referenced
the heat signature from O'Shaughnessy's

479
00:26:54.863 --> 00:26:57.157
to the one in the alleyway
from the second victim. like you asked.

480
00:26:58.117 --> 00:26:58.992
Guess what I found.

481
00:26:59.785 --> 00:27:02.204
Both signatures produced
an anomalous heat effect

482
00:27:02.329 --> 00:27:05.541
created by non-composites reacting
to hydrogen isotopes.

483
00:27:05.874 --> 00:27:06.917
Nuclear fusion.

484
00:27:07.167 --> 00:27:10.379
What you're describing is cold fusion.

485
00:27:11.046 --> 00:27:14.633
But Birch's powers come
from absorbing heat. not nuclear fusion.

486
00:27:14.716 --> 00:27:15.634
meaning...

487
00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:17.219
He's innocent.

488
00:27:18.345 --> 00:27:21.890
Yeah. We get this data to C.C.P.D..
we can clear his name.

489
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:24.560
Okay. Chester.
put everything you have on a drive.

490
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:27.104
I need to get this
to Captain Kramer fast.

491
00:27:27.771 --> 00:27:28.772
I need to find Birch.

492
00:27:31.525 --> 00:27:33.026
Let's hope he doesn't do
anything else stupid

493
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:34.236
before we can clear his name.

494
00:27:43.537 --> 00:27:48.417
Harold. I know this is tough. but we're
gonna find you a place to stay.

495
00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:52.671
I'm here to make sure your transition
is as easy as possible. Okay?

496
00:27:53.589 --> 00:27:56.550
Whatever.
I'm used to Jaco being a screw up.

497
00:27:57.551 --> 00:27:58.969
Especially since he got his powers.

498
00:28:09.229 --> 00:28:10.355
I want my son!

499
00:28:11.732 --> 00:28:12.691
Now!

500
00:28:18.113 --> 00:28:19.406
Harold. get out of the car.

501
00:28:22.826 --> 00:28:24.870
Get down on your knees
with your hands above your head.

502
00:28:24.953 --> 00:28:27.706
I'm not letting you cart my son off
to a bunch of strangers. Harold!

503
00:28:28.832 --> 00:28:30.250
Birch. I said get down.

504
00:28:32.628 --> 00:28:34.588
Why won't you leave me alone?

505
00:28:36.965 --> 00:28:40.427
C.C.P.D. scanners have Birch
at Hastings Avenue and Nicola Lane.

506
00:28:41.845 --> 00:28:46.975
Oh. Man. satellites just picked up
a city vehicle at the exact same spot.

507
00:28:47.809 --> 00:28:49.519
It's a Social Services SUV.

508
00:28:49.603 --> 00:28:51.438
He's trying to get his son.

509
00:28:51.521 --> 00:28:53.732
Barry. C.C.P.D. still doesn't know
that Birch is innocent.

510
00:28:53.815 --> 00:28:56.235
-If he tries to take his kid by force--
-We have to stop him...

511
00:28:57.027 --> 00:28:58.362
before he does something he'll regret.

512
00:29:00.072 --> 00:29:01.990
-Birch. listen to me.
-No. you listen.

513
00:29:02.991 --> 00:29:04.201
I just want my son.

514
00:29:04.952 --> 00:29:05.953
Now get out of my way.

515
00:29:10.123 --> 00:29:11.917
Wait. Wait. No. wait. wait.

516
00:29:14.294 --> 00:29:15.921
-Harold. stay back.
-She's right. son.

517
00:29:16.004 --> 00:29:17.589
-It's too dangerous.
-I'm not scared of him.

518
00:29:20.217 --> 00:29:22.678
Look. Harold. I know how bad this looks.

519
00:29:22.886 --> 00:29:25.264
but I swear I'd never hurt anyone.

520
00:29:25.514 --> 00:29:26.765
What's wrong with you?

521
00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:29.184
You get that
you're a total loser. right?

522
00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:33.021
I am a total loser.

523
00:29:34.022 --> 00:29:35.565
Have been since the day I was born.

524
00:29:36.733 --> 00:29:38.151
I thought having powers
would change all that.

525
00:29:38.235 --> 00:29:39.778
but all they did was make things worse.

526
00:29:40.654 --> 00:29:43.198
And now they've turned the only
good thing in my life against me.

527
00:29:43.991 --> 00:29:44.992
My own kid!

528
00:29:48.328 --> 00:29:49.329
All I wanted

529
00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:52.040
when I got out of Iron Heights
was a clean start.

530
00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:54.918
to get my life together
so we can be a family.

531
00:30:02.968 --> 00:30:04.386
This is your final warning.

532
00:30:04.594 --> 00:30:07.723
Who cares? No matter what I do.
you'll always think I'm a Killer.

533
00:30:08.181 --> 00:30:10.434
And now you want to take
my son away forever?

534
00:30:11.268 --> 00:30:13.186
Well. I won't let you!

535
00:30:19.568 --> 00:30:21.236
You can't keep me from my family. Flash.

536
00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.529
No one's taking Harold away.

537
00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:24.740
I know you didn't kill anyone. Birch.

538
00:30:24.823 --> 00:30:26.408
your lawyer found evidence
to prove you're innocent.

539
00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:29.369
But you have to stop what you're doing
before anyone gets hurt.

540
00:30:31.288 --> 00:30:32.122
Okay.

541
00:30:36.877 --> 00:30:37.794
All right?

542
00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:48.930
Oh. come on.

543
00:30:49.139 --> 00:30:50.474
I'm not doing anything.

544
00:30:50.557 --> 00:30:53.518
It's not what you're doing.
it's what you already did.

545
00:30:57.189 --> 00:30:58.607
Officer. get them to safety!

546
00:31:12.496 --> 00:31:13.580
Thanks for the save.

547
00:31:17.751 --> 00:31:19.878
Birch. your heat abilities.

548
00:31:20.504 --> 00:31:22.589
they're connected to the earth
beneath wherever you're standing.

549
00:31:23.382 --> 00:31:27.010
Yeah. science is not my strong suit. but
yeah. okay. I'll buy that for a dollar.

550
00:31:27.094 --> 00:31:28.428
He means emotionally.

551
00:31:28.678 --> 00:31:29.596
Ooh.

552
00:31:30.013 --> 00:31:31.223
-Right.
-Chester.

553
00:31:31.306 --> 00:31:33.433
can you scan
for thermal activity below us?

554
00:31:33.517 --> 00:31:34.393
Yeah. yeah.

555
00:31:35.394 --> 00:31:37.229
Mary Mack Gibson Jr.

556
00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:39.940
Okay. there's a volcano's worth of magma

557
00:31:40.107 --> 00:31:42.526
erupting beneath the city's lower crust.

558
00:31:42.651 --> 00:31:43.652
When Birch was upset.

559
00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:46.196
he must've absorbed so much heat
from the planet's core that

560
00:31:46.863 --> 00:31:48.365
he opened up a lava channel.

561
00:31:48.448 --> 00:31:50.659
Flash. if you can't stop this
in the next 30 seconds.

562
00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:52.619
Central City's gonna turn into
Mount Doom.

563
00:31:59.251 --> 00:32:00.460
Officer. get them back!

564
00:32:07.342 --> 00:32:10.720
Flash. you got to do something.
I know this is all my fault.

565
00:32:11.263 --> 00:32:12.806
But everyone in this city.

566
00:32:13.348 --> 00:32:17.477
my son. he can't die because of me.
You got to save him.

567
00:32:18.562 --> 00:32:21.022
No. you have to save him.
Look. I've got an idea.

568
00:32:21.648 --> 00:32:24.943
If it works. there's gonna be a huge
release of pressure forming beneath us.

569
00:32:25.026 --> 00:32:27.821
When that happens. I need you
to absorb the remaining heat.

570
00:32:28.488 --> 00:32:30.282
I've never done
anything like that before.

571
00:32:30.365 --> 00:32:31.616
You can do this.

572
00:32:32.534 --> 00:32:33.535
I know you can.

573
00:32:36.037 --> 00:32:38.248
Okay. ten seconds.
Time to ride or die. people.

574
00:32:45.505 --> 00:32:46.423
Let's rock.

575
00:32:49.593 --> 00:32:50.552
Where'd he go?

576
00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:54.014
I don't know. but I'm detecting
new activity right under the surface.

577
00:32:54.097 --> 00:32:54.973
Fifty meters down.

578
00:32:55.974 --> 00:32:57.767
No. no. wait. 90 meters down.

579
00:32:59.436 --> 00:33:01.646
One hundred and ten meters. 120 meters.

580
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:04.316
Whoa! Flash is doing his thing
underground. y'all.

581
00:33:05.317 --> 00:33:06.276
So get ready.

582
00:33:35.096 --> 00:33:35.972
Yes!

583
00:33:36.598 --> 00:33:38.350
Yes. Yes.

584
00:33:39.392 --> 00:33:40.769
You don't see that every day.

585
00:33:42.729 --> 00:33:44.898
Not that I'm complaining.
but how did you do that?

586
00:33:45.106 --> 00:33:47.067
I phased into the water table
under the city.

587
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:49.277
then released it
directly into the lava channel.

588
00:33:49.528 --> 00:33:50.445
I stopped the meltdown.

589
00:33:50.529 --> 00:33:52.781
but not the massive heat exchange
that was being released.

590
00:33:53.281 --> 00:33:55.909
What I couldn't stop.
but knew Birch could.

591
00:33:56.493 --> 00:33:58.328
Otherwise. everybody within
a ten block radius...

592
00:33:58.411 --> 00:33:59.246
...would've been fried like

593
00:33:59.329 --> 00:34:01.122
a Bananas Foster's
in the French Quarter.

594
00:34:01.498 --> 00:34:02.999
Mark and I are
going to Mardi Gras next year.

595
00:34:03.166 --> 00:34:04.125
Okay.

596
00:34:04.251 --> 00:34:07.087
Wait. So. saving hundreds of lives--

597
00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:08.296
Try thousands.

598
00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.007
...saving that many lives
is what I just did?

599
00:34:11.091 --> 00:34:11.925
Yeah.

600
00:34:12.842 --> 00:34:15.220
Looks like you're
the father Harold deserves after all.

601
00:34:16.471 --> 00:34:17.305
You okay?

602
00:34:17.847 --> 00:34:19.182
You used your powers again.

603
00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:22.018
I know. I know--

604
00:34:22.102 --> 00:34:23.186
To save us.

605
00:34:28.858 --> 00:34:29.901
Thanks. Dad.

606
00:34:30.485 --> 00:34:32.696
I love you. I love you.

607
00:35:00.974 --> 00:35:03.268
Okay. Okay.

608
00:35:03.727 --> 00:35:05.437
Social Services is
on their way with Harold.

609
00:35:06.229 --> 00:35:07.897
They should be here any minute.

610
00:35:10.066 --> 00:35:12.360
I can't believe they're actually
letting me have custody of my son.

611
00:35:13.653 --> 00:35:15.363
That evidence you found saved my ass.

612
00:35:16.364 --> 00:35:18.908
Plus. Harold is almost 18

613
00:35:18.992 --> 00:35:22.537
and Judge Hankerson
let him decide where he wanted to be.

614
00:35:22.621 --> 00:35:25.248
-And. you know. with his mom being--
-MIA as always?

615
00:35:25.874 --> 00:35:29.419
You and Harold are getting
another chance. A real one this time.

616
00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.047
It's all because of you two.

617
00:35:32.797 --> 00:35:33.715
And The Flash.

618
00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:35.050
Yeah. but...

619
00:35:36.259 --> 00:35:38.094
you're the one
who told him not to give up on me.

620
00:35:40.847 --> 00:35:42.349
-I'm just really grateful.
-Yeah.

621
00:35:42.432 --> 00:35:43.433
Thanks. Thank you.

622
00:35:43.516 --> 00:35:46.311
And if there's ever anything
I can do for you. just let me know.

623
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.438
Uh... Just be there for Harold.

624
00:35:58.323 --> 00:36:00.241
-Are you okay?
-I will be.

625
00:36:01.785 --> 00:36:02.786
Hey there. kiddo.

626
00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:04.120
Hey.

627
00:36:05.121 --> 00:36:05.997
Come on.

628
00:36:09.584 --> 00:36:13.171
Dinner is on me.
We've got a lot to catch up on.

629
00:36:24.224 --> 00:36:26.518
Barry. they are gonna be all right.

630
00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:33.733
I guess the real question is...

631
00:36:34.901 --> 00:36:35.819
are you?

632
00:36:46.996 --> 00:36:48.081
Come to gloat?

633
00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.126
No. Kind of the opposite.

634
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.630
I guess you saw the first article
for our new profile section.

635
00:36:55.714 --> 00:36:57.549
-You mean yours?
-Taylor.

636
00:36:57.632 --> 00:36:59.259
I know how this looks and...

637
00:37:00.969 --> 00:37:02.220
I want to apologize.

638
00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:06.141
Yes. Iris loves the Sanchez story.
but we are running

639
00:37:06.224 --> 00:37:08.309
your piece on Rosie Levin next week.

640
00:37:08.935 --> 00:37:11.438
And our audience deserves to read it.

641
00:37:11.855 --> 00:37:12.856
Thanks.

642
00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:16.192
So. tell me. what did I do to deserve

643
00:37:16.276 --> 00:37:18.528
getting stabbed in the back
by my own supervisor?

644
00:37:19.863 --> 00:37:21.239
Iris assigned you to help me.

645
00:37:21.322 --> 00:37:24.492
not run me over.
which is exactly what you did.

646
00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:29.080
I didn't mean to. And you're right.
I shouldn't have done that.

647
00:37:29.539 --> 00:37:33.293
I just-- I got excited.
and I guess I felt like

648
00:37:33.376 --> 00:37:36.588
Lydia's story was something
our readers needed right now.

649
00:37:36.671 --> 00:37:38.214
And that's how I felt about my story.

650
00:37:38.757 --> 00:37:42.677
Iris did. too. until you called in
a favor with the boss.

651
00:37:43.678 --> 00:37:45.138
Guess you learned that in prison.

652
00:37:49.392 --> 00:37:52.604
You're right.
I got lost in a great story.

653
00:37:52.687 --> 00:37:54.647
You stole my byline.

654
00:37:54.731 --> 00:37:56.983
Taylor. we are still publishing
your article.

655
00:37:57.066 --> 00:37:59.402
Because Iris is a journalist
with ethics.

656
00:37:59.778 --> 00:38:01.529
Something you are clearly lacking.

657
00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:04.407
Fine. Good to know.

658
00:38:04.741 --> 00:38:08.703
Look. I messed up. I said I'm sorry.

659
00:38:09.662 --> 00:38:10.955
It won't happen again.

660
00:38:11.748 --> 00:38:14.083
But I am still your supervisor.

661
00:38:14.667 --> 00:38:17.128
So I'm hoping we can get past this.

662
00:38:18.046 --> 00:38:18.880
Okay?

663
00:38:22.717 --> 00:38:25.637
I'm gonna destroy you. Yeah?

664
00:38:36.898 --> 00:38:38.900
Shouldn't we be toasting with champagne?

665
00:38:39.234 --> 00:38:42.821
Mm-mm. Plain old light beer.
that was Henry's favorite.

666
00:38:42.904 --> 00:38:44.697
And I used to give him hell about it.
I'd say.

667
00:38:44.781 --> 00:38:46.866
"You're a doctor.
you should have better taste."

668
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:48.785
Then he'd laugh and he'd say.

669
00:38:48.868 --> 00:38:52.330
"Well. I'll drink something
more expensive when you buy it."

670
00:38:55.416 --> 00:38:59.254
Do you guys remember when Henry
filled in on Dad's softball team?

671
00:38:59.337 --> 00:39:01.381
Oh. my gosh. what a disaster.

672
00:39:01.464 --> 00:39:02.799
What? What happened?

673
00:39:02.882 --> 00:39:03.800
Well. even as a kid.

674
00:39:03.883 --> 00:39:05.969
I knew that you're not supposed
to catch a ball with your face.

675
00:39:06.594 --> 00:39:08.054
Oh. no.

676
00:39:08.137 --> 00:39:09.097
No. Really?

677
00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.348
Yeah. Right in the nose.

678
00:39:10.765 --> 00:39:13.017
Good thing he was a doctor.
He was able to reset it himself.

679
00:39:15.895 --> 00:39:17.021
Hey. babe. are you okay?

680
00:39:18.815 --> 00:39:22.610
Yeah. no. it's... you know. it's nice to
hear everybody remembering him this way.

681
00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:24.904
What do you remember the most?

682
00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:28.575
Yeah. little things. mostly.

683
00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:33.454
Um...

684
00:39:33.997 --> 00:39:35.790
Like. he never made me

685
00:39:36.958 --> 00:39:40.628
clean my plate at dinner.
even when all I'd eat were carbs.

686
00:39:40.712 --> 00:39:44.924
like mac and cheese
or those Hawaiian dinner rolls.

687
00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:46.676
Mm.

688
00:39:47.135 --> 00:39:49.304
I... I kept asking him

689
00:39:50.388 --> 00:39:52.891
to read me the same bedtime story
over and over.

690
00:39:53.725 --> 00:39:57.645
It was one about
the hippo who went to school

691
00:39:57.729 --> 00:40:00.773
and made cookies for everyone.
and then became their friends.

692
00:40:03.276 --> 00:40:05.320
I can see how ridiculous
that must have been now.

693
00:40:06.738 --> 00:40:08.072
No. I'm sure he enjoyed it.

694
00:40:11.784 --> 00:40:13.244
Mostly. I just remember being loved.

695
00:40:16.789 --> 00:40:19.000
I still miss him. every day.

696
00:40:19.334 --> 00:40:22.003
And that is okay.

697
00:40:22.211 --> 00:40:23.129
Yeah.

698
00:40:25.506 --> 00:40:26.466
Well...

699
00:40:27.759 --> 00:40:29.802
happy birthday. Dad.

700
00:40:46.444 --> 00:40:49.072
So if Birch didn't kill those two.
then who did?

701
00:40:49.155 --> 00:40:51.741
I've checked
every fire-based meta human in here.

702
00:40:51.824 --> 00:40:55.703
everyone's either still at Iron Heights
or alibied up.

703
00:40:55.787 --> 00:40:58.206
So. what do we do now?

704
00:40:58.748 --> 00:40:59.958
I know what Joe would say.

705
00:41:00.708 --> 00:41:04.587
No suspects? Then shift your focus
to where it matters.

706
00:41:04.671 --> 00:41:05.630
The victims.

707
00:41:05.713 --> 00:41:09.801
But Stan and Donna were different ages.
races and genders.

708
00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:11.803
But they both worked at O'Shaughnessy's.

709
00:41:12.053 --> 00:41:13.680
So the killer's a disgruntled employee?

710
00:41:13.763 --> 00:41:16.474
Or they were chosen at random.
and we're still missing something.

711
00:41:19.519 --> 00:41:20.520
What are you thinking?

712
00:41:21.062 --> 00:41:23.356
Chester. the cold fusion data
we pulled off the bodies.

713
00:41:23.439 --> 00:41:25.525
could you program those variables
into the satellites?

714
00:41:25.608 --> 00:41:27.151
Sure. What am I looking for?

715
00:41:30.488 --> 00:41:31.489
More victims.

716
00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.912
If there's a meta serial killer
out there. we need to find them...

717
00:41:39.706 --> 00:41:40.957
...before somebody else gets hurt.

718
00:41:40.981 --> 00:41:49.981
