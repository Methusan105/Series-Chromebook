00:00:02.794 --> 00:00:05.088
To understand
what I'm about to tell you.

2
00:00:05.464 --> 00:00:07.466
there is something you need to remember.

3
00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:11.220
In every atom.
there is a perfect balance

4
00:00:11.303 --> 00:00:13.805
of protons and electrons.

5
00:00:14.223 --> 00:00:18.435
But it's those negative particles
that let an atom grow.

6
00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:22.231
My name is Dr. Meena Dhawan.

7
00:00:22.314 --> 00:00:27.819
and for the next three minutes and
52 seconds. I'm the fastest woman alive.

8
00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.450
Oh. My. Gosh.

9
00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:37.704
Did you see that?
I just hit 300 meters per second.

10
00:00:37.788 --> 00:00:39.039
It's your best time yet.

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.874
Now let's see if you can keep up.

12
00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:44.503
Come on.

13
00:00:45.254 --> 00:00:46.213
Come on. Meena.

14
00:00:59.643 --> 00:01:01.895
I'm so sorry. What just happened?

15
00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.897
You created
your own lightning bolt again.

16
00:01:04.273 --> 00:01:06.692
Something I couldn't do for months
when I first got my speed.

17
00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:07.859
I didn't mean to do it.

18
00:01:07.943 --> 00:01:11.321
I was just frustrated I couldn't
catch up. and then it just happened.

19
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:15.826
I've never seen artificial lightning

20
00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.036
interact with organic lightning
like this before.

21
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.874
Okay. that's disturbing.

22
00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.502
We should go over your biometrics.

23
00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:27.754
make sure everything else
is within normal parameters.

24
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:29.131
Yeah.

25
00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:31.842
I... I can't.
I have to head back to the lab.

26
00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:35.178
My speed is running out.

27
00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.848
Okay. tomorrow 10:00 a.m.

28
00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:08.754
Hi. I just need to...

29
00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:10.422
make a little deposit.

30
00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:13.008
It's in here somewhere.

31
00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:15.677
I have this new client
who decides to pay me in cash.

32
00:02:16.595 --> 00:02:18.555
What year is it?

33
00:02:18.764 --> 00:02:21.141
Oh! Got it. There we go.

34
00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:22.392
All right.

35
00:02:23.352 --> 00:02:24.811
Everybody. on the ground!

36
00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:26.104
Get down!

37
00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:27.898
Move!

38
00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:29.316
Get down!

39
00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:32.402
You. Cash in the bag.

40
00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:34.029
Don't even think about
hitting the alarm.

41
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.869
Hey. teacup! You trying to be a hero?

42
00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:47.626
Are you for real?

43
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.169
Get down. lady!

44
00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:59.930
What part of "Get down on the ground"
don't you understand? Let's go!

45
00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.517
If you don't get on the ground.
I swear to God...

46
00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:05.560
Three...

47
00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:06.978
Two...

48
00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:08.438
One.

49
00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:18.281
No.

50
00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:28.500
What am I doing here?

51
00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:32.879
I should have been an engineer.

52
00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:37.008
I just wanna go home. No voodoo. please.

53
00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:38.009
No voodoo.

54
00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.183
C.CP.D.!

55
00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:46.309
Stay where you are!

56
00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:04.369
Fiery Francis Sumner.

57
00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:07.205
Cecile. according to Gideon.

58
00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:10.333
your empathic capacity's up 1.000%.

59
00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:13.086
Your brain just got supercharged.

60
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.925
Usually when I sense a wave of fear
and panic. it just hits me like a train.

61
00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.302
Like when we fought Blockbuster.

62
00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.846
Exactly. Except this time
when my powers kicked in.

63
00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:25.724
I barely broke a sweat.

64
00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:28.393
Which is all very badass.

65
00:04:28.477 --> 00:04:32.314
But is anyone else wondering
how the heck this happened?

66
00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:33.774
Well. I mean. I don't know.

67
00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:37.360
My powers have changed before.
like when Jenna was born.

68
00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:40.071
Maybe it's just natural.

69
00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:43.200
It's possible.
but let's run some more tests

70
00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.701
just to make sure.

71
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.996
-Barry.
-Hmm.

72
00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:51.833
I can feel a massive wave of concern
wash over you.

73
00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:55.212
You're worried about something.
It's way more than just me.

74
00:04:56.797 --> 00:05:01.384
It's the new speedster I'm training.
Meena Dhawan.

75
00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:06.181
During our last training session. I got
struck by her artificial lightning.

76
00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:07.808
Now. it was an accident.

77
00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:10.852
But when it hit me.
it collided with my lightning

78
00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:14.105
and it set off some kind
of a bio-kinetic chemical reaction.

79
00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:18.902
Okay. Accidental attacks.
Artificial speed...

80
00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:21.279
Is she about to go all Spock. Flash?

81
00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:22.739
No. I don't think so.

82
00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:26.284
I mean. Meena did find a way to generate
her own speed source artificially.

83
00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:28.453
but it's not affecting her
like it did me.

84
00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:30.205
I mean. her emotions seemed fine.

85
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.207
So it's just her powers that are funky.

86
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:35.001
Maybe you should fathwoom
over to Fast Track Labs.

87
00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:36.336
take a peek at that generator.

88
00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.839
See how her speed machine really works.

89
00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:45.762
-Barry Allen.
-Yeah.

90
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:47.013
Sorry to keep you waiting.

91
00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:48.098
No. no.

92
00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:49.933
How can I help you?

93
00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:55.355
Yeah. actually. I am here
on behalf of a mutual friend.

94
00:05:56.147 --> 00:05:59.109
Who likes to run... fast.

95
00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:02.195
-Oh.
-Yes.

96
00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:07.909
Our friend was hoping I could take
a look at your. um. special project.

97
00:06:08.994 --> 00:06:11.705
He thinks it'd be a good idea
to get a second set of eyes on this

98
00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:14.207
just to make sure everything is safe.

99
00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:17.502
I understand.

100
00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:21.298
And he's right.

101
00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:24.801
I could use another scientific eye
on all this right now.

102
00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:26.511
- Okay.
- Follow me.

103
00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:27.512
Yeah.

104
00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:34.978
There she is. my pride and joy.

105
00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:36.980
Wow.

106
00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:39.524
Is that an oscillation chamber?

107
00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:44.321
It's a Biometric Lightning
Oscillation Chamber. technically.

108
00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:45.739
We call it the B.L.O.C.

109
00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:48.450
It's filled with quantum computing
to remotely harness lightning

110
00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:49.868
from the Earth's upper atmosphere.

111
00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:53.580
and turn it into artificial speed.

112
00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:57.876
This equipment is decades ahead
of any other lab.

113
00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:01.463
Oh. including yours. I hope?

114
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.966
But I can't take full credit
for all this innovation.

115
00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:07.385
Sure. I can handle the physics.

116
00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:11.014
but my colleague is more familiar
with the nuts and bolts.

117
00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:14.601
Ah. there he is.

118
00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:29.324
Barry Allen. meet the man
who built this machine.

119
00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:33.995
Eobard Thawne. Nice to meet you.
Barry Allen.

120
00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:45.632
Eobard Thawne.

121
00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:48.593
Nice to meet you. Barry Allen.

122
00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:56.226
Thawne...

123
00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:59.980
I'm chief of engineering here
at Fast Track Laboratories.

124
00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:03.650
Eobard here is our only employee
who knows the truth about this project

125
00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:09.155
while I'm still perfecting it.
and Barry here is a friend of the Flash.

126
00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:10.991
Really?

127
00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:13.243
Yeah. You know the Flash. don't you?

128
00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:16.830
-No. I--
-Do...

129
00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:19.040
You two. have you met before?

130
00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:25.922
-Go to hell!
-You're taking both of us there!

131
00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:29.092
Now who's the villain. Flash?

132
00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:31.219
Now who's the villain?

133
00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:35.348
No. I don't think so.

134
00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:39.394
Uh. but my memory is a little hazy.

135
00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:43.106
Eobard suffers from a rare form
of retrograde amnesia.

136
00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:44.607
You're kidding?

137
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:48.653
I just I have trouble accessing memories
connected to my personal life.

138
00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:53.366
You know. anything over a year ago.
all I get are occasional flashes.

139
00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:56.411
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm.

140
00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:57.871
Hey. Avery.

141
00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:07.630
I'm supposed to believe
you don't remember who you are.

142
00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:13.178
Or where you're from.
What the hell are you doing here?

143
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.180
Why did you build this thing?

144
00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:18.600
Because Meena asked me to.

145
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.187
Her lightning is like nothing
I've ever seen before.

146
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.897
I guess that's your doing. isn't it?

147
00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.316
I assure you.
the B.L.O.C is perfectly safe--

148
00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.358
But you aren't.

149
00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:30.487
What he hell do you want from me?

150
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.282
I'm sorry. I have no idea why you're
so upset with somebody you just met.

151
00:09:34.365 --> 00:09:35.492
Stop. Stop!

152
00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:39.579
I've known you all my life.

153
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.208
You're the Reverse-Flash.

154
00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:44.876
Look. Allen.

155
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.880
I have no idea what you're talking about

156
00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:50.840
or why you think I'm
a murderous speedster--

157
00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:51.925
Because you are.

158
00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:53.718
No. I'm not.

159
00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:58.973
Now. if you don't mind.
I have work to do.

160
00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:09.484
Chester. has A.R.G.U.S. posted
any security alerts?

161
00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:11.027
Uh...

162
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:12.529
No.

163
00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:15.490
Is everything okay. boss?

164
00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:19.119
-No. I just saw Thawne.
-What? How did he escape?

165
00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:21.162
I don't know.
but he's using his original face again.

166
00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:23.039
the one he had
before he killed Harrison Wells.

167
00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:24.290
Okay. how is that even possible?

168
00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:26.751
And how the frak did he end up
working at Fast Track Labs?

169
00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:28.878
I don't know that either.
but I'm going to find out.

170
00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:34.634
I can't hire you. Mr. Thawne.
This resume is a joke.

171
00:10:34.717 --> 00:10:36.219
Well. nobody's perfect.

172
00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:39.222
Wow.

173
00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:41.516
You really are something.

174
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.435
Even after the 11 other interviews
I had today.

175
00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:48.857
I'm starting to think that all this
is just like a huge waste of time.

176
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.651
I mean. seriously?

177
00:10:51.734 --> 00:10:53.403
You call this a resume?

178
00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:57.323
Am I boring you?

179
00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:04.038
When calculating quantum static
and genetic speed.

180
00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:07.876
you have to account for the tachyons.

181
00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:19.804
I have been working on this for months.

182
00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:22.807
No one's even come close.

183
00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:25.268
Well. the other candidates were idiots.

184
00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:27.395
I'm not.

185
00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:31.274
Which is how I can tell
you're trying to create a speedster.

186
00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:35.820
I can help.

187
00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:52.545
How are you still here?

188
00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:57.717
Well. I want to see how this ends.

189
00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.093
Don't screw with me.

190
00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:00.929
How'd you get your speed back?

191
00:12:01.804 --> 00:12:02.847
I didn't.

192
00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:05.266
Stop lying! I saw you.

193
00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:08.561
Five minutes ago. a thousand miles
from here. wearing your original face.

194
00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:11.147
pretending you didn't remember me.
So who is he?

195
00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:13.274
A version of you from your past?

196
00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:16.486
Answer me!

197
00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:17.612
I don't know.

198
00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:20.490
And I don't care.

199
00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:22.200
Don't you get it?

200
00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:24.285
You took my speed.

201
00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:26.746
There's no other versions of me
out there.

202
00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:28.790
No other tricks up my sleeve.

203
00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:30.833
You took everything from me.

204
00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:33.753
So why don't you just leave me alone?

205
00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:38.967
When you were nearly erased
during Armageddon.

206
00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:41.886
It erased your past. didn't it?

207
00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:45.682
Which means he must be
from another timeline.

208
00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.977
Like when I created Flashpoint.
there was another Thawne.

209
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.479
-I need you to kill my mother.
-With pleasure.

210
00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:54.274
The only way to fix things
was to let him go.

211
00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:55.692
He fought with the Legends.

212
00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:57.235
He tried to keep himself
from getting erased.

213
00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:59.028
But Black Flash caught up to him.

214
00:13:01.572 --> 00:13:04.534
I guess he didn't finish the job.
Here's a suggestion.

215
00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:06.786
Why don't go you bother him?

216
00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:18.047
The other Thawne built this.
Does that mean anything to you?

217
00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:21.050
He didn't build that. That's mine.

218
00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:24.304
That's my Biometric
Lightning Oscillation Chamber

219
00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:27.348
that I built two centuries from now
when I was a younger man

220
00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:29.684
to see if I could become
a speedster like you.

221
00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:31.102
It worked.

222
00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:32.687
But not the way I intended.

223
00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:35.773
Has it tapped into
the Negative Speed Force?

224
00:13:38.359 --> 00:13:40.153
That's why Meena's powers
are so erratic.

225
00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:43.489
They're not artificial.
They're negative.

226
00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:46.117
I've seen what
that kind of force can do.

227
00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:48.161
-Who's Meena?
-Dr. Meena Dhawan.

228
00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:49.454
She's the one that's using the B.L.O.C.

229
00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:50.872
Never heard of her.

230
00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:53.124
And guess what? Neither has history.

231
00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:57.587
So I guess your new adversary. you make
sure that this Dr. Meena Dhawan...

232
00:13:58.338 --> 00:13:59.630
never sees the future.

233
00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:01.924
Because if she keeps using that device.

234
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.595
the Negative Speed Force will start
to alter her personality.

235
00:14:06.888 --> 00:14:08.014
it'll destroy her.

236
00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:09.265
Not "if."

237
00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:11.351
"When."

238
00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:16.022
There's one thing you should know
about us Thawnes. Allen.

239
00:14:16.105 --> 00:14:20.777
No matter when we exist.
no matter what our memories are.

240
00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:24.280
we only look out for ourselves.

241
00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:27.617
So whatever this new guy's endgame...

242
00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:33.956
he'll sacrifice every pawn on the board
to get what he wants.

243
00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.042
Not if I stop him
before he has a chance.

244
00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:41.381
Well.

245
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:48.429
Just when I thought this day
couldn't get any more interesting.

246
00:14:49.263 --> 00:14:51.849
Oh. John.

247
00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:54.352
you can come out now.

248
00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:09.909
It's been a long time.

249
00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:13.579
Last time I saw you. you were still
pretending you needed a wheelchair.

250
00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:20.002
Last time I saw you. your friend
Oliver Queen was still alive.

251
00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:25.800
What do you want. John?

252
00:15:26.551 --> 00:15:30.888
For the past two years. I've covered
every corner of this Earth.

253
00:15:34.308 --> 00:15:37.061
And I still can't get
this damn thing to open up again.

254
00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:42.775
But I believe you can.

255
00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:48.239
This cube fell out of the sky
and dropped into my lap.

256
00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:51.409
Before I could see what was inside.
it shut itself.

257
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:54.620
I've had friends examine
every inch of it.

258
00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:55.955
I can't get it open.

259
00:15:56.497 --> 00:15:59.584
Damn it. Got that same line
from A.R.G.U.S.

260
00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:02.003
And all they could tell me
is that its...

261
00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.341
knowledge is beyond
any current human understanding.

262
00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:09.760
and that it can transport matter.

263
00:16:10.344 --> 00:16:12.263
So when I heard from Lyla
you were here. I...

264
00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:15.558
You thought some
23rd century ingenuity might help.

265
00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:16.934
Good call.

266
00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:20.062
Why not just have Lyla
give it to me herself?

267
00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:24.400
I see. Trouble in Paradise.

268
00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:27.737
Trying to open this box...

269
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.116
I had to spend
a lot of time away from home.

270
00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:34.619
Away from my kids.

271
00:16:34.952 --> 00:16:37.163
But you just can't leave
the box behind. can you?

272
00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:40.208
Even when this thing is away from me.

273
00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:45.171
I can still feel it in my mind.
it's pulling me closer.

274
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:53.221
And the more I fight it.
the louder I hear its call.

275
00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:54.388
but I have to know what it is.

276
00:16:55.723 --> 00:16:58.309
I have to know what
these damn voices want from me.

277
00:16:59.101 --> 00:16:59.936
Well.

278
00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:02.980
You've come to the right place.

279
00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:05.816
I've seen transmatter technology
like that before

280
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:11.489
forged at the Orrery of Worlds with
the power to travel across realities.

281
00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:16.410
So. yeah.
I'll help you on one condition.

282
00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:20.456
that when you open up that box again.
John.

283
00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:25.169
I get to see what's inside.

284
00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:29.257
Chester.
I'm heading back to Central City.

285
00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:32.301
I need you to find out who's
still inside Fast Track Labs.

286
00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:35.888
Pretty cleared out
for the night.

287
00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:37.682
just two heat signatures inside.

288
00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:38.891
Meena and Thawne.

289
00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:40.768
What's the 411. boss?

290
00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:42.228
I think it's the Thawne from Flashpoint.

291
00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:43.980
Now he's pumping Meena
with negative speed.

292
00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:45.982
-If you need backup--
-No. it's too dangerous.

293
00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:48.234
I don't know why he's doing this.
but I won't let anyone get hurt.

294
00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:52.238
Artificial speed saturation at zero.

295
00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:55.116
-Ready for infusion.
-Doc.

296
00:17:55.866 --> 00:17:58.995
you set the oscillation levels
at 52 million joules.

297
00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.872
that is more speed
than you have ever absorbed before.

298
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.334
Are you sure the Flash
would want you to do this?

299
00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:07.336
He's why I'm doing this.

300
00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:10.172
I hurt him this morning
when my speed started to run out.

301
00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:13.009
I need to make it last longer.

302
00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:19.348
Powering the chamber.

303
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.436
Activating electrostatic fins...

304
00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:28.816
Ready for biometric absorption.

305
00:18:32.236 --> 00:18:33.070
Meena. stop!

306
00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:39.744
Flash. What are you doing here?

307
00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:44.248
Flash. I know what happened today.
and I know how to fix it.

308
00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:45.625
No. you don't.

309
00:18:45.708 --> 00:18:47.043
I know why you attacked me.

310
00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:50.212
It's because your speed is connected
to the Negative Speed Force.

311
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:54.300
It's an extra dimensional power source
fueled by rage and hate.

312
00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:57.011
The B.L.O.C is fueled by lightning
from the upper atmosphere.

313
00:18:57.094 --> 00:18:59.221
We've run the numbers a thousand times.

314
00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:02.224
Then your math's wrong
or you're a damn liar.

315
00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:05.102
Eobard. What is he talking about?

316
00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:07.063
I'm talking about who he really is.

317
00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:10.566
The Eobard Thawne that I know.
no matter what body he's in

318
00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.944
or what timeline he comes from.
he's always the same person.

319
00:19:14.862 --> 00:19:15.863
A psychotic murderer...

320
00:19:15.946 --> 00:19:17.114
Please don't hurt me.

321
00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:18.824
...known as the Reverse-Flash.

322
00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:20.618
No!

323
00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:23.204
I didn't do anything to you
or anyone else.

324
00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:24.497
Why can't you understand that?

325
00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.915
I'm done listening to you.

326
00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:28.125
Whatever you're trying to do to her.
it ends now.

327
00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:29.585
You're making a huge mistake.

328
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:31.212
No. I'm taking you to Iron Heights.

329
00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:32.546
which is letting you off easy.

330
00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:35.508
Leave him alone!

331
00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:37.551
Meena. don't!

332
00:19:39.053 --> 00:19:40.513
Oh. no.

333
00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:42.682
Her brainwaves are altering.
it's too much power.

334
00:19:42.706 --> 00:19:44.706
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

335
00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:20.344
Speed.

336
00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:24.098
Need... more...

337
00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:27.393
speed.

338
00:20:55.379 --> 00:20:57.298
Time to get faster.

339
00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:12.772
These cubes appear to people
at a crossroads. at a...

340
00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:15.149
turning point in their lives.

341
00:21:15.232 --> 00:21:17.485
So when the cube first opened.
what was going through your mind?

342
00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:20.821
I had just buried Oliver.

343
00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:24.700
We were moving the kids to Metropolis.

344
00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:25.743
You were starting a new life.

345
00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:28.078
You were in control of your destiny
for the first time in years.

346
00:21:28.162 --> 00:21:31.707
That is why the cube chose you
for that sense of purpose.

347
00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:35.336
Then why did it close?

348
00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:37.630
Because you weren't ready
to accept its power yet.

349
00:21:39.089 --> 00:21:41.300
But really.
the only question. John. is...

350
00:21:42.843 --> 00:21:43.844
are you ready now?

351
00:21:50.184 --> 00:21:52.561
-l am.
-Good.

352
00:21:54.438 --> 00:21:56.398
Then put yourself
in that head space again.

353
00:21:58.275 --> 00:21:59.527
Close your eyes.

354
00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:03.239
think of what your future could be.

355
00:22:05.825 --> 00:22:09.787
All the light you could bring
into this world.

356
00:22:14.959 --> 00:22:18.337
All the cosmic odysseys that await.

357
00:22:21.257 --> 00:22:23.801
No one can know my secret.

358
00:22:24.385 --> 00:22:26.804
You don't come between
those folks and their gold.

359
00:22:26.887 --> 00:22:29.431
Sir. we are quite sure
you will bring them back to justice.

360
00:22:29.807 --> 00:22:30.641
Look at them all.

361
00:22:31.642 --> 00:22:34.061
All those lives you can lead.

362
00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.689
Do it. John. do it.

363
00:22:36.772 --> 00:22:39.525
Drink of the Bleed Mandrakk hid
within the cube.

364
00:22:39.608 --> 00:22:42.194
feel its power break through
the source wall.

365
00:22:42.278 --> 00:22:44.154
for when you break through that wall.

366
00:22:44.238 --> 00:22:46.991
all those worlds that await
will be yours.

367
00:22:47.908 --> 00:22:51.912
This universe
is far bigger than any of us...

368
00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:55.499
I couldn't dare imagine.

369
00:23:02.923 --> 00:23:03.841
No.

370
00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:05.509
I don't want this.

371
00:23:07.303 --> 00:23:08.304
I don't want any of this!

372
00:23:09.638 --> 00:23:11.473
Do you hear me? The answer is no!

373
00:23:17.271 --> 00:23:18.480
No. no!

374
00:23:19.982 --> 00:23:21.984
What have you done?
Do you know what you've done?

375
00:23:22.902 --> 00:23:23.944
I do.

376
00:23:25.905 --> 00:23:27.114
I finally do.

377
00:23:30.534 --> 00:23:32.369
I saw a thousand lives I could lead.

378
00:23:35.664 --> 00:23:37.791
But not one of them
led me back to my family.

379
00:23:38.709 --> 00:23:42.171
I was meant to see inside that cube!

380
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:44.882
To find a way out of this hell hole!

381
00:23:46.508 --> 00:23:48.802
I guess it's a good thing
the cube didn't choose you.

382
00:23:53.807 --> 00:23:55.100
You're not special.

383
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.813
You're not someone important.

384
00:24:00.356 --> 00:24:02.900
This was your last chance
to be someone powerful.

385
00:24:05.027 --> 00:24:06.153
But I am...

386
00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:07.404
someone special.

387
00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:12.242
Now I realize

388
00:24:13.452 --> 00:24:15.621
the cube was trying
to make me someone else.

389
00:24:16.997 --> 00:24:18.207
something else.

390
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.420
And it even tricked me into believing
that somehow

391
00:24:25.047 --> 00:24:26.382
I wanted it to. but...

392
00:24:28.342 --> 00:24:29.259
I don't.

393
00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:34.723
Because there is no power
in the universe

394
00:24:36.725 --> 00:24:38.811
more powerful than the love
I have for my family.

395
00:24:40.854 --> 00:24:42.022
Sweetie.

396
00:24:51.907 --> 00:24:54.159
But I suppose a man like you
wouldn't understand that.

397
00:24:56.787 --> 00:25:01.333
Because if it came down to a choice
between some cosmic destiny or

398
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.253
being a father.

399
00:25:05.212 --> 00:25:06.046
a husband...

400
00:25:09.633 --> 00:25:11.010
there's really no choice at all.

401
00:25:29.611 --> 00:25:33.574
Hey. Lyla. Hey. baby. no. no.

402
00:25:33.657 --> 00:25:36.201
I didn't see Barry this time.
I think he has a lot on his plate.

403
00:25:38.662 --> 00:25:40.664
Yeah. you're right.
We do have a lot to talk about.

404
00:25:43.417 --> 00:25:44.334
But I'm coming home.

405
00:26:05.481 --> 00:26:08.859
Chester. Meena's negative lightning
pulses cancelled out my speed again.

406
00:26:08.942 --> 00:26:10.736
just like this morning.

407
00:26:10.819 --> 00:26:11.820
Chester?

408
00:26:12.071 --> 00:26:12.988
Meena.

409
00:26:15.032 --> 00:26:16.742
-Where is she?
-She's gone.

410
00:26:17.493 --> 00:26:19.620
This is what you wanted
all along. isn't it?

411
00:26:19.995 --> 00:26:21.705
For the Negative Speed Force
to corrupt her.

412
00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:23.123
Why would I want that?

413
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:28.545
I didn't even know the Negative
Speed Force existed before today!

414
00:26:31.965 --> 00:26:33.258
She protected you from me.

415
00:26:33.342 --> 00:26:34.218
Why would she do that?

416
00:26:34.301 --> 00:26:35.719
Because she loves me!

417
00:26:36.762 --> 00:26:37.721
You idiot!

418
00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.682
And I love her.

419
00:26:43.602 --> 00:26:44.895
More than anything.

420
00:26:47.189 --> 00:26:48.565
When I lost my memories.

421
00:26:49.399 --> 00:26:51.318
I had a singular focus in my life.

422
00:26:51.985 --> 00:26:54.947
Somehow. some way.
I was going to be a speedster.

423
00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:56.073
And then I met Meena.

424
00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:01.495
Everything changed.

425
00:27:03.205 --> 00:27:07.209
I know this sounds strange. but
I think I'm supposed to be a speedster.

426
00:27:07.751 --> 00:27:09.711
I think that's why.
despite all the holes in my brain.

427
00:27:09.795 --> 00:27:12.339
I can see the B.L.O.C crystal clear.

428
00:27:12.464 --> 00:27:13.632
I think I'm meant to use it.

429
00:27:14.424 --> 00:27:18.929
So you you want to be
like Flash. be a superhero?

430
00:27:19.012 --> 00:27:21.306
I want to be bigger than a superhero.

431
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:23.767
I want to recharge power grids.

432
00:27:23.851 --> 00:27:27.855
I want to reverse tornadoes
before they destroy cities and towns.

433
00:27:27.938 --> 00:27:29.690
I want to end famine. end war.

434
00:27:29.773 --> 00:27:32.317
I want to save the world.

435
00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:35.904
But it wasn't meant to be.

436
00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:38.323
I had already fallen in love with Meena

437
00:27:38.407 --> 00:27:41.326
when we discovered her machine
could only work for one person.

438
00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:42.953
This isn't right.

439
00:27:44.538 --> 00:27:46.165
But that wasn't the worst part.

440
00:27:47.207 --> 00:27:48.917
Meena had a heart condition.

441
00:27:49.751 --> 00:27:53.422
And one night.
she went into cardiac arrest.

442
00:27:53.881 --> 00:27:56.049
Meena. no!

443
00:27:57.718 --> 00:28:00.053
There was only one way to save her.

444
00:28:18.447 --> 00:28:19.865
You gave up your dream.

445
00:28:22.868 --> 00:28:24.369
Your chance to save the world.

446
00:28:25.954 --> 00:28:27.247
You are my world.

447
00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:39.092
So please. even if I was this... monster

448
00:28:39.593 --> 00:28:42.596
somehow or in another life.

449
00:28:42.679 --> 00:28:45.265
don't hold my sins against her.

450
00:28:45.349 --> 00:28:46.600
I am begging you.

451
00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:50.437
Save her.

452
00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:55.442
The Thawne I know has haunted my life
since I was just a kid.

453
00:28:58.028 --> 00:28:59.905
He's killed people I care for.

454
00:29:01.448 --> 00:29:02.574
He deserves to rot.

455
00:29:04.993 --> 00:29:07.329
He could never put
someone else's needs before his.

456
00:29:10.749 --> 00:29:11.667
I'm sorry.

457
00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.003
You're not the man I thought you were.

458
00:29:17.339 --> 00:29:18.340
You're someone better.

459
00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:28.558
My speed's back.

460
00:29:29.768 --> 00:29:31.728
Flash? Flash. are you there?

461
00:29:31.812 --> 00:29:33.146
Yeah. I hear you. What's happening?

462
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.774
Okay. Meena's attacking power junctions
all over the city.

463
00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:38.860
Why would Meena need electricity?

464
00:29:40.362 --> 00:29:42.155
Her speed is supposed to be temporary.

465
00:29:43.115 --> 00:29:46.493
If Meena runs out of speed. the Negative
Speed Force will lose its grip on her.

466
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:52.207
It's making her absorb electricity
to make more speed and maintain control.

467
00:29:52.291 --> 00:29:53.583
If that's the case.
then she's going to look

468
00:29:53.667 --> 00:29:55.252
for the largest power source possible.

469
00:29:57.921 --> 00:29:59.089
The Keystone Cleveland Dam.

470
00:30:08.682 --> 00:30:10.392
Time to get faster.

471
00:30:29.328 --> 00:30:33.165
Speed. Unlimited speed.

472
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.050
Meena. I don't want to hurt you.

473
00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:45.427
But you're not in control
of yourself right now.

474
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:48.138
and if this dam breaks.
thousands of people could die.

475
00:30:48.597 --> 00:30:49.514
Then let them.

476
00:30:55.103 --> 00:30:56.146
Guys. she's right behind me.

477
00:30:56.229 --> 00:30:57.147
Are you in position?

478
00:30:57.856 --> 00:31:00.484
Almost. Everyone okay back there?

479
00:31:00.567 --> 00:31:02.277
I just hacked into Meena's speed gauge.

480
00:31:02.361 --> 00:31:05.238
Her saturation is already
under 40%. it's working.

481
00:31:06.198 --> 00:31:09.076
If Flash can keep her running
for another 119 seconds.

482
00:31:09.159 --> 00:31:11.286
she'll burn off the rest of her speed.

483
00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:42.984
Meena? Are you okay?

484
00:32:02.212 --> 00:32:05.132
Flash? Can you hear me. Flash?

485
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:08.718
She just summoned power
directly from the Negative Speed Force.

486
00:32:10.095 --> 00:32:11.805
It canceled out the Flash's power.

487
00:32:20.522 --> 00:32:22.691
How pathetic...

488
00:32:22.774 --> 00:32:29.448
Avatar of the speed force
dying on his back.

489
00:32:32.617 --> 00:32:36.580
Meena. stop! I can't let you do this.

490
00:32:36.663 --> 00:32:37.539
Please.

491
00:32:37.622 --> 00:32:39.416
Please. you have to stop this.

492
00:32:39.583 --> 00:32:42.335
The Meena you knew is gone.

493
00:32:43.128 --> 00:32:48.842
Lost in the electrostatic pits
of your precious machine.

494
00:32:49.301 --> 00:32:50.552
I know you're still there.

495
00:32:51.219 --> 00:32:53.889
I can feel you locked away inside.

496
00:32:53.972 --> 00:32:54.890
Please.

497
00:32:55.348 --> 00:32:56.308
Meena. come back to me.

498
00:32:56.641 --> 00:32:59.895
You're wasting your time.

499
00:33:04.316 --> 00:33:07.235
This is who I am now.

500
00:33:07.694 --> 00:33:10.947
And killing the Flash is my purpose.

501
00:33:11.448 --> 00:33:13.617
No. No. it isn't!

502
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.494
Perhaps I should Kill you first.

503
00:33:17.287 --> 00:33:22.250
Go ahead. because I'd rather die
right here. right now.

504
00:33:22.918 --> 00:33:23.877
than lose you.

505
00:33:25.795 --> 00:33:27.380
I know the real you.

506
00:33:28.256 --> 00:33:31.343
You're the genius who stumped
every lab tech in Central City.

507
00:33:31.426 --> 00:33:33.929
You have to account for the tachyons.

508
00:33:34.054 --> 00:33:37.182
The health conscious partner
who'd never let me have a cheeseburger.

509
00:33:37.265 --> 00:33:38.433
Don't tell anybody.

510
00:33:38.517 --> 00:33:41.978
The hero who taught me to put others
before myself.

511
00:33:42.896 --> 00:33:47.609
And that Meena. she would never be able
to do something like this.

512
00:33:50.654 --> 00:33:51.863
I love you. Meena.

513
00:33:52.572 --> 00:33:53.782
The chamber's ready.

514
00:33:54.658 --> 00:33:56.493
But only one of us can use it.

515
00:33:56.576 --> 00:33:59.454
I am begging you. please.

516
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.624
I want to save the world.

517
00:34:03.833 --> 00:34:05.335
I want to save the world. too.

518
00:34:08.296 --> 00:34:09.631
You are my world.

519
00:34:10.048 --> 00:34:11.341
No!

520
00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:13.093
I can't lose you!

521
00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:16.096
Please...

522
00:34:17.305 --> 00:34:18.265
come back to me.

523
00:34:18.682 --> 00:34:19.808
Come back to me.

524
00:34:21.601 --> 00:34:22.644
You should go first.

525
00:34:31.987 --> 00:34:32.904
Eobard.

526
00:34:33.154 --> 00:34:33.989
Oh. God.

527
00:34:36.783 --> 00:34:39.744
-Flash. are you okay?
-Yeah. I will be.

528
00:34:40.912 --> 00:34:41.955
So will they.

529
00:34:44.958 --> 00:34:45.917
You saved me.

530
00:34:46.793 --> 00:34:50.046
No. you saved me.

531
00:35:00.849 --> 00:35:03.226
Okay. Well.
my speed has finally worn off.

532
00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:06.813
And so are the effects the
Negative Speed Force had on your brain.

533
00:35:07.939 --> 00:35:11.526
I know that your experiment
didn't exactly go as planned.

534
00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:15.989
but... this is one seriously dope lab.

535
00:35:17.657 --> 00:35:18.742
How do you feel now?

536
00:35:18.825 --> 00:35:21.995
Well. I finally feel like myself again.

537
00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:26.791
I am so sorry
I didn't listen to you. Flash.

538
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.128
We built the B.L.O.C
so we could help people.

539
00:35:30.211 --> 00:35:33.173
but if we can't use it without me
turning into a super villain--

540
00:35:33.256 --> 00:35:34.841
Then it's not worth the risk.

541
00:35:35.342 --> 00:35:37.552
Especially if we don't even know
how we tapped into

542
00:35:37.636 --> 00:35:39.888
the Negative Speed Force to begin with.

543
00:35:41.348 --> 00:35:42.807
What if there was a way around it?

544
00:35:43.433 --> 00:35:45.810
Whenever I start to feel
like I'm in over my head.

545
00:35:45.894 --> 00:35:49.147
I think about the person I love most.

546
00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:51.608
She helps guide me home.

547
00:35:52.025 --> 00:35:53.026
Like a lightning rod.

548
00:35:54.486 --> 00:35:57.864
Just like tonight when the Negative
Speed Force corrupted you.

549
00:35:57.947 --> 00:35:59.574
Eobard brought me back.

550
00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:06.456
So you think that our bond
could help me control my powers?

551
00:36:06.539 --> 00:36:08.750
It would take some tinkering
with the B.L.O.C.

552
00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:12.295
but if Eobard's your lightning rod.

553
00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.382
there's nothing
you can't accomplish together.

554
00:36:16.675 --> 00:36:19.344
Well. should we take a look
at the instruction manual?

555
00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:20.470
Oh!

556
00:36:20.553 --> 00:36:23.098
I thought you'd never ask.

557
00:36:25.725 --> 00:36:27.977
Sorry to interrupt the sniffers.

558
00:36:28.061 --> 00:36:30.814
When you said that
Flashpoint Thawne came back.

559
00:36:30.897 --> 00:36:33.358
I reached out to a mutual friend
to gather some intel.

560
00:36:33.942 --> 00:36:34.943
He just left a message.

561
00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:41.533
Chester. Hey. sorry it took me so long
to get back.

562
00:36:41.616 --> 00:36:44.744
The Quincy P. Runk Institute
is having a minor infestation

563
00:36:44.828 --> 00:36:46.996
of serpent creatures
from the Morlay dimension.

564
00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.082
It's under control. I think.

565
00:36:49.165 --> 00:36:52.168
As for your question. I was out
having retirement drinks with Nate

566
00:36:52.252 --> 00:36:55.964
and turns out the Legends had their own
encounter with Reverse-Flash this year.

567
00:36:56.047 --> 00:36:59.384
Yeah. apparently the Time Wraiths
saved him from Black Flash.

568
00:36:59.926 --> 00:37:02.262
My power's stripped. I was "re-educated"

569
00:37:02.637 --> 00:37:05.724
and assigned here
to protect this fixed point.

570
00:37:05.807 --> 00:37:07.392
As penance for your past crimes.

571
00:37:07.475 --> 00:37:09.728
Believe it or not. Sarah.
I came to see their point.

572
00:37:10.311 --> 00:37:14.983
That history cannot
and should not be changed.

573
00:37:15.066 --> 00:37:17.026
Thawne spent years
protecting the timeline.

574
00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:18.445
-Thawne.
-It is yours now.

575
00:37:19.404 --> 00:37:23.074
Until he died helping the Legends.
Pretty tragic twist. huh?

576
00:37:23.158 --> 00:37:25.702
Oops!

577
00:37:25.994 --> 00:37:28.788
Another serpent loose.
so I just gotta grab my sword.

578
00:37:29.456 --> 00:37:30.415
And. it's over here.

579
00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:34.335
Wait. If Thawne from Flashpoint
became a hero.

580
00:37:34.419 --> 00:37:35.545
but then. died...

581
00:37:35.879 --> 00:37:36.921
How could he be here?

582
00:37:37.005 --> 00:37:40.550
Maybe when he sacrificed himself.
the Time Wraiths saved his life again.

583
00:37:41.134 --> 00:37:42.886
-Brought him here.
-To Meena.

584
00:37:44.512 --> 00:37:47.098
Guys. I know it sounds crazy.
but however it happened.

585
00:37:47.182 --> 00:37:48.600
I think we're lucky it did.

586
00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:51.936
So are they.

587
00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:56.065
Plus. we could always use
another hero around here.

588
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.987
Stop!

589
00:38:02.363 --> 00:38:03.823
You think I'm playing with you?

590
00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.116
Give me the purse!

591
00:38:12.624 --> 00:38:14.209
What's happening to me?

592
00:38:34.813 --> 00:38:36.439
Now that's more like it.

593
00:38:49.285 --> 00:38:50.495
-Mark.
-Yes.

594
00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:52.664
Are you in my apartment?

595
00:38:52.747 --> 00:38:53.665
Yes.

596
00:38:53.915 --> 00:38:54.874
Where the hell are you?

597
00:38:54.958 --> 00:38:56.292
With my mom.

598
00:38:56.376 --> 00:38:59.087
I needed to get out of there.
clear my head.

599
00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:02.131
Then do that and get your ass
back here. okay?

600
00:39:02.966 --> 00:39:04.551
I was looking at our data
again last night.

601
00:39:05.218 --> 00:39:06.678
It all clicked for me.

602
00:39:07.303 --> 00:39:09.973
Caitlin. I know how to bring Frost back.

603
00:39:10.056 --> 00:39:11.099
We can't.

604
00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:12.267
Not now.

605
00:39:12.767 --> 00:39:14.435
Plus. Barry took the Mirror Gun.

606
00:39:15.895 --> 00:39:18.314
I'm sorry. Mark. but It's over.

607
00:39:18.398 --> 00:39:19.482
We don't need the gun.

608
00:39:20.275 --> 00:39:21.484
Not for what we're gonna do.

609
00:39:25.864 --> 00:39:27.198
We just need you.

610
00:39:43.089 --> 00:39:44.257
What did you do?

611
00:39:45.592 --> 00:39:47.135
My speed is my life.

612
00:39:49.721 --> 00:39:52.181
I wonder what face I'll be wearing
next time we meet.

613
00:39:53.975 --> 00:39:55.184
Merry Christmas.

614
00:39:56.185 --> 00:39:58.438
And I'm just getting started!

615
00:39:59.981 --> 00:40:02.150
Everything you are is because of me!

616
00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:03.192
What did you do?

617
00:40:03.693 --> 00:40:06.487
I got faster than you.

618
00:40:06.571 --> 00:40:09.574
Your precious
Speed Force cannot help you now.

619
00:40:09.657 --> 00:40:13.912
because in this timeline.
Iris chose me. I won.

620
00:40:16.205 --> 00:40:20.043
There is no trace of the
Negative Speed Force left in your body.

621
00:40:20.126 --> 00:40:21.669
You took my life!

622
00:40:21.961 --> 00:40:23.630
And left me in hell.

623
00:40:26.466 --> 00:40:28.635
We've been looking
for you. Eobard.

624
00:40:31.137 --> 00:40:34.641
The man with no past.

625
00:40:36.059 --> 00:40:37.226
The anomaly.

626
00:40:39.479 --> 00:40:41.022
You were invisible to us

627
00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:45.485
until the light from that damn cube
showed us where to find you.

628
00:40:49.948 --> 00:40:52.909
Well. good for me.

629
00:40:54.369 --> 00:40:57.580
Now. who are you and...

630
00:40:59.248 --> 00:41:00.625
what do you want?

631
00:41:02.752 --> 00:41:06.839
I guess you could say I'm an old friend.

632
00:41:08.049 --> 00:41:12.428
And a new one all rolled up in one.

633
00:41:14.389 --> 00:41:15.932
Because that's how I roll.

634
00:41:17.767 --> 00:41:18.977
And as for why I'm here?

635
00:41:27.902 --> 00:41:29.988
It's time to fulfill your destiny.

636
00:41:30.012 --> 00:41:38.012
