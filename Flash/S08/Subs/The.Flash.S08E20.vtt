﻿1
00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:15.974
You were dead.

2
00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:18.227
I saw your body.

3
00:00:18.477 --> 00:00:19.353
And yet...

4
00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:23.357
here I am. in the flesh.

5
00:00:24.483 --> 00:00:25.817
How's that possible?

6
00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.028
The Negative Forces...

7
00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:30.572
brought me back.

8
00:00:30.948 --> 00:00:32.157
Because they were too weak

9
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.369
without a fourth member
of their merry band.

10
00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:37.162
Didn't I tell you...

11
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.916
that finding ways to Kill you

12
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.293
is my life's work?

13
00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:47.256
Here's what's really funny.

14
00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.383
Killing your mother

15
00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:52.010
led to the birth of the Flash.

16
00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:53.929
and killing Iris...

17
00:00:55.264 --> 00:00:57.057
led to the rebirth of me.

18
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:02.271
So I guess you could say
your mother and Iris...

19
00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:05.065
were good for something.

20
00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:14.741
Dad! Stop!

21
00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:15.784
He's not worth it.

22
00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:17.119
He killed your mother!

23
00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:21.498
Dad. if you do this.
you'll be just as bad as him!

24
00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:32.759
Yeah.
what's the matter. Flash?

25
00:01:34.303 --> 00:01:35.804
You can't finish the job?

26
00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:38.849
You better finish the job!

27
00:01:39.558 --> 00:01:41.310
Because if you don't...

28
00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:44.521
they're next.

29
00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.316
Dad. don't listen to him. please.

30
00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.485
Even if he did kill Mom.
now. in 2022. we're still here.

31
00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:52.279
Don't you see? We're still alive.

32
00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:54.698
She's right. We haven't been
erased from the timeline yet.

33
00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:57.284
Which means Mom isn't dead yet.

34
00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:43.914
They're both hurting.

35
00:02:45.207 --> 00:02:47.626
-Badly.
-Okay. so what do we do now?

36
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:49.836
We find Iris and we bring her home.

37
00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:51.963
Then we find a way to take down
the Negative Forces.

38
00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:54.257
‘cause if they come back
for a rematch...

39
00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:55.509
I don't think they will.

40
00:02:56.093 --> 00:02:57.511
They already got what they came for.

41
00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.346
The last Thawne in existence.

42
00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:00.847
What do they need him for anyway?

43
00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:02.265
There's only one way
to find out.

44
00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:04.810
I have to find a way
into the Negative Speed Force.

45
00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:08.605
Dad.

46
00:03:10.107 --> 00:03:11.441
No offense. That's insane.

47
00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:12.567
I don't have a choice.

48
00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:15.278
As long as Thawne's out there.
everyone's in danger.

49
00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:17.114
Chester already ran a satellite search.

50
00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:18.699
Thawne's nowhere on the planet.

51
00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:21.034
The only place left to hide
is the Negative Speed Force.

52
00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:22.452
- So if I can find a way in...
- No.

53
00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:25.288
Look. I can feel
all of the anger inside you. I can.

54
00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:28.083
And I know that you've been
to hell and back today.

55
00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:31.253
but we need to think
our next move through.

56
00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:32.337
He killed Iris!

57
00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:39.094
Barry. how can you possibly be so sure?

58
00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:40.345
Because I am.

59
00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:42.931
Guys.

60
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.143
We need to talk to our dad.

61
00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:52.190
Fine.

62
00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:55.694
I'll call Joe and tell him
that we're all okay.

63
00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:02.200
Look.

64
00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:05.036
Assuming we can find our way
into the Negative Speed Force.

65
00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:06.913
let us handle this.

66
00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:11.126
We will make sure
Thawne gets back to Iron Heights.

67
00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.086
Dad. we promise.

68
00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:14.880
You weren't there.

69
00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:18.258
You didn't see what I saw.

70
00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:23.972
Iris died in my arms

71
00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:26.808
before her body disappeared.

72
00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:29.478
You say she's alive.

73
00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:33.023
but for all we know. she's already
been erased from this timeline.

74
00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.858
Only the changes haven't caught up
with us yet.

75
00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:36.026
It's happened before.

76
00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:38.236
You still want to kill him.

77
00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:40.655
Don't you?

78
00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:52.959
Hello?

79
00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:00.133
Is anybody here?

80
00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:03.136
Hello. Iris.

81
00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:07.682
Damien?

82
00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.394
If you're here.
does that mean that I'm dead. too?

83
00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:12.479
No. it doesn't.

84
00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:16.024
What happened to you
is far more interesting than that.

85
00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:19.027
We have a lot to discuss.

86
00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:29.496
Going inside
is the only way to end this.

87
00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:31.081
Barry. it sounds dangerous.

88
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.165
'Cause it is.

89
00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:36.837
Fine.

90
00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:40.966
So how exactly do you get inside
the Negative Speed Force?

91
00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:43.802
The first time
I went into the Positive Speed Force.

92
00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:47.264
Harry hit me with a concentrated blast
of dark matter and lightning

93
00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.182
that generated a tachyon reaction.

94
00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:51.685
Well. I could rig the tachyon harness
to do the same.

95
00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:54.354
Only if you're trying to get into
a negative place.

96
00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:56.606
you're going to need
a negative source of lightning.

97
00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:58.567
Like me.

98
00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.027
Uh...

99
00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.698
Meena. I don't think
that's such a good idea right now.

100
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.241
We need to find a way in.

101
00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:10.036
I'm the key.

102
00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:12.873
Chester. go ahead and get started.

103
00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.887
You wanna tell me how you're gonna deal
with all of that anger?

104
00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:31.099
Barry.

105
00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:34.644
I can feel it pouring off of you.

106
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:36.938
What are you planning?

107
00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:42.694
Oh. my God.

108
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.322
You want revenge.

109
00:06:46.615 --> 00:06:49.868
But why?
Bart and Nora said that Iris is alive.

110
00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:51.036
And I know she's not.

111
00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:55.790
Cecile. Cecile.

112
00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.001
What is it?

113
00:06:58.126 --> 00:06:59.377
Someone's calling my name.

114
00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.758
And now I'm picking up desperation.

115
00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:06.635
You have to find us.

116
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.221
You're the only one that can help us.

117
00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:11.681
- Who is it?
- Bashir?

118
00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:14.100
What happened to you?
Where are the other Forces?

119
00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:20.941
He's gone.

120
00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:22.943
-Was it our Bashir?
-Yeah.

121
00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:25.070
And he's in pretty bad shape.

122
00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:26.529
He said that...

123
00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:28.615
I'm the only one who can help them.

124
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:34.621
I think he wants me to help bring back
the other Positive Forces.

125
00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:00.897
His timeline's gone.

126
00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:02.357
I love you.

127
00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:07.112
Well. we wanted you
to feel at home.

128
00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:19.207
You. uh...

129
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:20.875
You know who we are.

130
00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:25.130
Beings who can do all this.

131
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.384
I'm guessing you're the Negative Forces.

132
00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:30.844
Why am I here?

133
00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:34.347
You never wondered
where your speed really comes from?

134
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.850
I built a machine...

135
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.770
that taps into the Negative Speed Force.

136
00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:43.106
allowing me to siphon it for my own use.

137
00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:45.233
Brilliant.

138
00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:47.193
Oh. you didn't tap into it.

139
00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:49.863
No. no. no. It tapped into you.

140
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.074
It's true.

141
00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:56.578
The Negative Speed Force
has always existed.

142
00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:59.039
It chose you as an avatar

143
00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:01.708
because it feeds off your hatred
for Barry Allen.

144
00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.418
The other Thawne
forgot that.

145
00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:07.255
No hate. no Negative Speed Force avatar.

146
00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:09.299
That's why he had to go.

147
00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:11.176
I don't know what you're planning.

148
00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:16.848
But if you think I'm gonna stand here
and play your stupid game...

149
00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:21.853
Relax.

150
00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:23.855
We're not gonna hurt you.

151
00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:25.899
I'm just gonna transform you.

152
00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:32.072
So. let me guess.

153
00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.449
The last thing you remember is

154
00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:38.036
figuring out that the Negative Forces
used your time sickness

155
00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:40.872
-to rebirth a new avatar.
-Yes.

156
00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:42.916
But if I've had this time sickness
for months. then--

157
00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:43.833
Why now?

158
00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:47.212
The Negative Forces
used your body as an incubator.

159
00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.839
And. yes. it's a dastardly scheme.

160
00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:52.217
Reminds me of my bad old days.

161
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.843
Okay. so if I'm alive. then...

162
00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:56.179
Where am I?

163
00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:58.389
You're here inside my Time Stone.

164
00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:02.268
The talisman that you and Barry used
to wipe out anachronisms during...

165
00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:04.312
Armageddon.

166
00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:10.568
I can't feel my connection
to Barry anymore.

167
00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:13.113
And if it's the same for him.
then Damien.

168
00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:15.365
I have to get out of here
and I need your help.

169
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.451
-Even if you're--
-A remnant of my old consciousness

170
00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:19.994
imprinted on a stone?

171
00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:23.331
Bearing witness
to all timelines for eternity.

172
00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:25.083
Wahoo.

173
00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:27.168
Are you saying that
I'm stuck here forever. too?

174
00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:28.461
Oh. no. no. no.

175
00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:29.587
No. that's up to you.

176
00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:31.631
See. unlike me.

177
00:10:31.923 --> 00:10:33.258
you aren't supposed to be dead.

178
00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:35.677
Which is why.
at the moment that the Negative Forces

179
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.178
annihilated your body.

180
00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:38.972
the stone spared you.

181
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:42.725
It senses that you still have
something important to do.

182
00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:44.561
The question is.

183
00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:46.187
are you up to it?

184
00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:55.238
Okay. you all ready?
The harnesses are good to go.

185
00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:01.744
What is happening?

186
00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:05.331
-Oh. God.
-I'm shutting down remote ignition.

187
00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:07.375
-Keep on going.
-But. Barr...

188
00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:08.418
Do it!

189
00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:16.467
I'm calling it.

190
00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:19.304
Dad!

191
00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:22.682
-Why didn't it work?
-I don't know.

192
00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:25.059
If this won't work. we can't access
the Negative Speed Force.

193
00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:26.436
Then we need to find another way.

194
00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.357
Eobard would have known what to do.

195
00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:34.944
But now he's gone.

196
00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:38.615
Because of me...

197
00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:43.119
and that damn machine.

198
00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:45.788
Dad.

199
00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:56.799
Meena...

200
00:11:57.842 --> 00:11:58.676
You don't want to do this.

201
00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.928
Yes. I do.

202
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.388
This machine ruined my life.

203
00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:03.431
No. it didn't.

204
00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:05.183
Thawne did.

205
00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:16.778
There is nothing we can do about it!

206
00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:21.407
Not anymore.

207
00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:29.582
Yes. there is.

208
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.626
Look. Meena...

209
00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:34.254
I know exactly how you feel.

210
00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:36.714
You're the only one who understands.

211
00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:38.716
Who knows how this has to end.

212
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:42.679
That's why you can't destroy your work.
We need it.

213
00:12:43.554 --> 00:12:44.430
What for?

214
00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:46.557
So we can get you charged...

215
00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:49.227
and you can share your speed again.

216
00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:51.229
With me.

217
00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:09.455
Your speed's at 100%.

218
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.127
Promise me when you find that bastard.

219
00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:17.505
you'll never let him hurt anyone else
ever again.

220
00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:23.136
Do you remember what you did
when you shared your speed with Eobard?

221
00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:26.723
You told me I had to share
the most important parts of myself.

222
00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:46.284
Baby girl...

223
00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:49.704
Wherever you are.

224
00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.792
please. please.

225
00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:57.920
come back home soon.

226
00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:03.926
Jay? Joan? What are you...

227
00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:05.303
What are you doing here?

228
00:14:05.386 --> 00:14:08.264
We've been following Iris'
particle trail across the timestream.

229
00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:10.141
and it led us here.

230
00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:13.019
When Cecile called.
she said that Iris was still missing.

231
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:15.813
Not anymore.

232
00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:18.608
Come this way.

233
00:14:32.246 --> 00:14:33.247
What is that thing?

234
00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:34.874
It's a time stone.

235
00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:37.585
I've heard about it in my travels.

236
00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:39.128
Where did you get it?

237
00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:45.927
Damien Darhk gave it to me.
He said I might need it one day.

238
00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:48.596
But why is it glowing now?

239
00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:50.264
Those particles that were left behind?

240
00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:52.642
They're Iris' consciousness.

241
00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:56.104
And now I think they've somehow
ended up inside the stone.

242
00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:57.855
How do we get her out of there?

243
00:15:06.447 --> 00:15:07.615
I can't believe we're doing this.

244
00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:10.159
Look. Allegra. we have to bring
the Positive Forces back.

245
00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:12.370
This is the only way
we can help Flash do it.

246
00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:14.872
Who cares about him?

247
00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:16.749
Yeah.

248
00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:18.584
We just want our powers back.

249
00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:21.838
Okay. look.
both of you are now ex-psychics.

250
00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:23.756
but you know exactly the way
that this works.

251
00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:27.718
Now start concentrating
and help me focus in.

252
00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:29.303
I will do all the heavy lifting.

253
00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:51.701
You found me.

254
00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:54.287
Oh...

255
00:15:54.912 --> 00:15:56.247
Oh. my God. are you okay?

256
00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:00.585
This is a nice office.

257
00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:01.878
What happened?

258
00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:05.840
Iris' time sickness. it spread to us.

259
00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:09.343
So we needed to tether ourselves
to someone in this reality.

260
00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:10.511
I chose Cecile.

261
00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:12.889
-Why?
-Because of your boundless potential.

262
00:16:13.014 --> 00:16:14.599
So I opened the floodgates of your mind.

263
00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:16.893
That's how you were able to absorb
the gifts of others.

264
00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:18.769
Whoa. whoa. whoa. Hold on. wait. wait.

265
00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:22.565
So you're the guy
who gave her all of our powers?

266
00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:23.691
Mm.

267
00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:24.859
Thanks.

268
00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:27.320
You're... welcome.

269
00:16:27.528 --> 00:16:30.823
So you now have the strength
to bring back the Forces.

270
00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:32.325
That is. if you're willing to help us.

271
00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:33.409
Of course I will.

272
00:16:34.368 --> 00:16:35.244
What do you need me to do?

273
00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:43.211
Your biometrics are spiking.

274
00:16:43.294 --> 00:16:45.046
We thought the bad Forces were back.

275
00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:47.715
but now you're going into
the Negative Speed Force without us.

276
00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:52.803
We're too late.

277
00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:00.937
Thawne.

278
00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:12.823
What the hell?

279
00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:15.326
Eobard can't come to the phone
right now.

280
00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:17.286
He's going through some changes.

281
00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:18.704
What are you doing to him?

282
00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.875
Helping him reach his full potential.

283
00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:26.420
If this was all about Thawne.
why did you attack us?

284
00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:29.423
Oh. man. you came at us first

285
00:17:30.841 --> 00:17:31.842
for Armageddon.

286
00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:36.305
When you cut off the
Negative Speed Force from his avatar.

287
00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:40.643
Now. see. we...

288
00:17:42.186 --> 00:17:43.771
We've been pulling the strings
ever since.

289
00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:46.440
Finally ready now.

290
00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:49.569
See.
this is on you. Flash.

291
00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:51.362
You tipped the scales.

292
00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:53.072
We're just...

293
00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:56.909
putting things back to normal.
and then some.

294
00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:04.458
This all started the day
that you severed Thawne's speed.

295
00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:07.712
The day that you upset
the cosmic balance.

296
00:18:07.878 --> 00:18:09.755
Something we didn't know was possible...

297
00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:12.508
until you showed us how.

298
00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:17.597
And that was also the day
that we realized...

299
00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:21.225
we could do the same.

300
00:18:23.686 --> 00:18:25.229
Time to tip the scales.

301
00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:29.609
Dad. are you okay?

302
00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:31.736
It's all my fault.

303
00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:33.696
What about Thawne?

304
00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:34.780
The Negative Forces.

305
00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:37.033
They were transforming him somehow.

306
00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:38.159
So he's still alive.

307
00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:40.620
But they already gave him
his speed back.

308
00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:42.038
What more could they want?

309
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:43.956
Guys?

310
00:18:44.206 --> 00:18:46.751
I'm picking up a huge influx
of negative kinetic tachyons.

311
00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:48.252
Where?

312
00:18:51.422 --> 00:18:52.590
Right over downtown.

313
00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:15.071
There's no point in running.

314
00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:19.033
You're all going to die.

315
00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:50.022
Holy shrap. That's Thawne.

316
00:19:50.272 --> 00:19:51.273
Who's his new tailor?

317
00:19:52.274 --> 00:19:53.109
Satan?

318
00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:56.487
Guys. I'm not just picking up
negative kinetic isotopes.

319
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:59.740
Reading temporal. geothermic.
electrochemical ones. too.

320
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.410
He has the power
of all four Negative Forces now.

321
00:20:02.785 --> 00:20:03.619
Why?

322
00:20:04.995 --> 00:20:07.415
To tip the balance of power
in their favor.

323
00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:09.667
Turn the entire world
into a living hell.

324
00:20:14.755 --> 00:20:16.340
You said I had unfinished business.

325
00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:20.469
What is it?

326
00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:25.182
It's Barry. isn't it?

327
00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:28.811
Where is he? What's happening?

328
00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:32.189
If you want to find out.
you have to get out of here yourself.

329
00:20:34.525 --> 00:20:35.484
How. damn it?

330
00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:37.403
Oh. come on. Iris.

331
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.071
Look at your life.

332
00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:41.073
Look at everything
that has happened to you

333
00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:42.867
since Barry went into that coma.

334
00:20:43.534 --> 00:20:45.161
You were destined to die.

335
00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:47.830
held captive in another dimension.

336
00:20:48.205 --> 00:20:51.584
Hell. you faced certain death
over and over and over again.

337
00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:54.086
And every time you should have died.
only you didn't.

338
00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.129
Why?

339
00:20:55.671 --> 00:20:56.922
Because I always had help. I--

340
00:20:57.006 --> 00:20:59.633
Thanks for playing.
Wrong answer.

341
00:21:00.718 --> 00:21:01.635
Come on.

342
00:21:02.636 --> 00:21:03.804
It's right in front of you.

343
00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:05.264
You're a survivor.

344
00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.433
You always will be.

345
00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:11.812
I haven't reached my limit.

346
00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:14.899
No. you haven't.

347
00:21:15.024 --> 00:21:17.109
But what about the spark
between Barry and I?

348
00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:18.986
Well...

349
00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:24.033
Just because you can't feel it.

350
00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:26.744
doesn't mean it isn't there.

351
00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:30.456
So. what are you gonna do now?

352
00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:34.168
Spend the rest of eternity
hanging out with Damien Darhk?

353
00:21:38.756 --> 00:21:39.673
No.

354
00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:42.218
Atta girl!

355
00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:45.137
I'm gonna reignite it.

356
00:21:58.859 --> 00:22:00.402
Say hi to your old man for me.

357
00:22:32.434 --> 00:22:34.979
You're outnumbered. Four to one.

358
00:22:35.354 --> 00:22:37.356
You're going to pay
for everyone you've hurt.

359
00:22:38.065 --> 00:22:40.025
Especially Eobard.

360
00:23:07.344 --> 00:23:08.262
Bart?

361
00:23:09.305 --> 00:23:11.557
Dad? Is he going to be okay?

362
00:23:12.182 --> 00:23:14.643
If that's Impulse. where is Thawne?

363
00:23:15.644 --> 00:23:16.604
Right here.

364
00:23:23.986 --> 00:23:25.029
What did you do?

365
00:23:25.154 --> 00:23:26.614
I sent them back in time.

366
00:23:27.781 --> 00:23:30.117
A billion years. to be precise.

367
00:23:33.537 --> 00:23:34.622
We only have one chance.

368
00:23:38.584 --> 00:23:41.670
Okay. What do you need me to do?

369
00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:46.258
Put it on.

370
00:23:48.427 --> 00:23:50.721
There's a reason you were given
all these powers. Cecile.

371
00:23:52.014 --> 00:23:55.017
The powers you absorbed were enhanced
by the one thing that I like.

372
00:23:55.517 --> 00:23:57.269
Your ability to care about people.

373
00:23:58.187 --> 00:23:59.188
That's why you were chosen.

374
00:24:00.314 --> 00:24:01.315
So. take it.

375
00:24:02.024 --> 00:24:05.319
The mask will reabsorb your
psychic powers and transfer them to me.

376
00:24:08.447 --> 00:24:10.950
Don't even think about it.

377
00:24:32.221 --> 00:24:33.138
Wait.

378
00:24:33.555 --> 00:24:34.848
She has to go through this.

379
00:24:42.815 --> 00:24:44.942
Cecile. are you okay?

380
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.321
Did it work?

381
00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.616
I sure as hell hope so.

382
00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:21.937
Well. well. well.

383
00:25:26.734 --> 00:25:28.402
Who's faster now. Flash?

384
00:25:40.581 --> 00:25:44.877
Oh!

385
00:25:45.335 --> 00:25:46.795
How does it feel. Flash?

386
00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.925
How does it feel knowing
you could have prevented all this?

387
00:25:52.342 --> 00:25:56.263
If only you'd killed me

388
00:25:57.306 --> 00:25:59.600
when you had the chance.

389
00:26:01.435 --> 00:26:02.561
Believe me...

390
00:26:05.147 --> 00:26:07.191
that's a mistake I won't make.

391
00:26:15.783 --> 00:26:16.700
Who's doing this?

392
00:26:19.078 --> 00:26:20.162
Who's doing this?

393
00:26:21.163 --> 00:26:22.039
I am.

394
00:26:27.753 --> 00:26:32.424
You're too late
because your pathetic avatar

395
00:26:32.966 --> 00:26:34.510
is powerless.

396
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.886
You call that power?

397
00:26:37.888 --> 00:26:39.389
This is power.

398
00:27:06.416 --> 00:27:07.626
This is impossible.

399
00:27:09.128 --> 00:27:10.671
No. this is the end.

400
00:27:21.473 --> 00:27:22.766
We're equals now. Thawne.

401
00:27:23.809 --> 00:27:24.685
Equals?

402
00:27:25.727 --> 00:27:26.687
Never.

403
00:27:27.062 --> 00:27:28.564
I have always been.

404
00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:30.899
I will always be better than you.

405
00:27:53.088 --> 00:27:54.089
This is for Iris.

406
00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:56.717
for everyone you've Killed.

407
00:28:24.578 --> 00:28:25.579
What is it?

408
00:28:26.205 --> 00:28:30.334
Some kind of temporal disruption
coming from inside the stone.

409
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.384
Dad?

410
00:28:41.637 --> 00:28:42.512
Baby girl.

411
00:28:43.847 --> 00:28:45.098
-Oh!
-Dad!

412
00:28:46.475 --> 00:28:50.020
It's okay. It's okay.
Damien Darhk showed me the way back.

413
00:28:55.525 --> 00:28:56.777
That felt like an earthquake.

414
00:28:57.527 --> 00:28:59.196
Or something a lot worse.

415
00:29:02.741 --> 00:29:06.078
Again. our top story.
the deadly new speedster

416
00:29:06.203 --> 00:29:09.998
who has already taken dozens of lives
has been engaged by the Flash.

417
00:29:10.374 --> 00:29:13.794
But fallout from the fight
has turned the city into a war zone.

418
00:29:14.086 --> 00:29:15.420
Residents are advised...

419
00:29:16.505 --> 00:29:18.382
Barry's doing more harm than good.

420
00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:20.133
They started Armageddon.

421
00:29:20.217 --> 00:29:22.469
Jay. I need you
to take me downtown. fast.

422
00:29:35.607 --> 00:29:36.483
Barry!

423
00:29:39.027 --> 00:29:39.903
Barry!

424
00:29:40.362 --> 00:29:41.280
Iris?

425
00:29:46.076 --> 00:29:47.035
Barry. you have to stop.

426
00:29:47.369 --> 00:29:48.287
No. I have to finish this.

427
00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:49.746
No. Barry. listen to me.

428
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:51.081
The city can't take any more fighting.

429
00:29:51.164 --> 00:29:52.082
That's why I have to end this.

430
00:29:52.165 --> 00:29:53.041
You can't!

431
00:29:54.876 --> 00:29:56.003
She's right.

432
00:29:56.461 --> 00:30:00.007
We'll never stop
until one of us is dead.

433
00:30:01.967 --> 00:30:03.552
Time to tip the scales.

434
00:30:14.229 --> 00:30:15.272
Get Iris to safety.

435
00:30:16.023 --> 00:30:16.940
Good luck.

436
00:30:21.903 --> 00:30:22.946
I'm done fighting you.

437
00:30:34.249 --> 00:30:35.625
Do you think I won't kill you?

438
00:30:37.419 --> 00:30:40.130
I'll slaughter you where you sit!

439
00:31:00.317 --> 00:31:02.778
I just need more power. Do you hear me?

440
00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:04.988
I just need more power.

441
00:31:11.703 --> 00:31:13.705
We're not meant to tip the scales.

442
00:31:17.376 --> 00:31:18.835
You won't survive. Thawne.

443
00:31:19.169 --> 00:31:20.712
You lie. Flash!

444
00:31:21.421 --> 00:31:22.672
This is the moment.

445
00:31:22.696 --> 00:31:24.696
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

446
00:32:28.572 --> 00:32:29.489
No.

447
00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:38.248
It's not supposed to end like this.

448
00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:20.624
Dad?

449
00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:41.770
What is that?

450
00:33:42.646 --> 00:33:44.439
It's the universe resetting itself.

451
00:33:58.036 --> 00:34:00.038
Barry.
your Force particles are gone.

452
00:34:00.247 --> 00:34:01.748
And as for you. Iris.

453
00:34:02.749 --> 00:34:04.626
there's no sign
of your time sickness anywhere.

454
00:34:05.085 --> 00:34:06.086
You're completely cured.

455
00:34:06.836 --> 00:34:10.298
And Gideon says there's no Thawne
anywhere in the timeline.

456
00:34:11.424 --> 00:34:12.467
Then it's really over.

457
00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:15.136
All of it.

458
00:34:17.556 --> 00:34:20.892
Bart. Nora. about the way
I behaved today...

459
00:34:21.101 --> 00:34:21.935
Uh-uh.

460
00:34:22.435 --> 00:34:23.353
No.

461
00:34:24.062 --> 00:34:27.107
Not after all of the things
that you have helped us with.

462
00:34:28.441 --> 00:34:31.111
He's right. Dad.
At the end of the day. all that matters

463
00:34:31.611 --> 00:34:33.071
is you did the right thing.

464
00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:40.662
And on that note. I think we should all
go back to our lives in 2049.

465
00:34:41.371 --> 00:34:43.290
-Great work today. Flash.
-Thank you.

466
00:34:43.373 --> 00:34:44.457
As always.

467
00:34:44.958 --> 00:34:45.875
Thank you.

468
00:34:46.835 --> 00:34:47.711
Bye.

469
00:34:49.504 --> 00:34:51.631
Guys. guys!

470
00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.592
Thank you for everything.

471
00:34:53.675 --> 00:34:54.759
Don't sweat it. Pops.

472
00:34:56.177 --> 00:34:58.847
It was all "aster." No "dis."

473
00:34:59.514 --> 00:35:00.515
No idea what that means.

474
00:35:02.183 --> 00:35:03.101
You don't need to.

475
00:35:06.104 --> 00:35:07.731
All right. love you. Pops.

476
00:35:08.273 --> 00:35:09.649
-Mom.
-See you. guys.

477
00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:11.651
We love you.

478
00:35:17.782 --> 00:35:18.908
How are you feeling?

479
00:35:19.534 --> 00:35:22.078
Like there is so much I don't know.

480
00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.165
But more importantly.

481
00:35:26.124 --> 00:35:27.584
the B.L.O.C. is no longer working.

482
00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:32.672
It was never my idea. was it?

483
00:35:34.591 --> 00:35:35.508
No. it wasn't.

484
00:35:36.593 --> 00:35:39.304
The Negative Speed Force
used the machine to pick its avatars.

485
00:35:40.263 --> 00:35:41.389
You were a means to an end.

486
00:35:44.225 --> 00:35:45.644
I'm sorry you lost your speed.

487
00:35:45.894 --> 00:35:49.522
Don't be. It was never
my dream to be a speedster.

488
00:35:51.483 --> 00:35:52.901
I know I never got to meet him.

489
00:35:54.319 --> 00:35:56.488
but Eobard seemed like
a very special person.

490
00:35:56.696 --> 00:35:57.739
He was.

491
00:36:01.618 --> 00:36:02.535
I wanted to give you this.

492
00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.705
We found it at S.T.A.R. Labs.

493
00:36:13.296 --> 00:36:14.255
Thank you.

494
00:36:16.466 --> 00:36:17.425
For everything.

495
00:36:25.892 --> 00:36:26.810
I should go.

496
00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:31.523
Hey. Meena. look. if you need anything.
just call us. okay?

497
00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:32.774
We're here for you.

498
00:36:32.982 --> 00:36:33.942
I know.

499
00:36:35.819 --> 00:36:39.656
Oh. and if Team Flash ever needs a
helping hand.

500
00:36:39.739 --> 00:36:41.700
as in the technical kind.

501
00:36:43.535 --> 00:36:44.494
you know where to find me.

502
00:36:56.506 --> 00:36:59.342
Good news. Your brain's back
to its old empathic capacity.

503
00:36:59.634 --> 00:37:01.136
Dillon has her powers back.

504
00:37:01.219 --> 00:37:03.972
The Queen. too.
who's back in Iron Heights.

505
00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:05.682
I am going to miss being leveled up.

506
00:37:05.765 --> 00:37:08.143
I'm just glad we all survived this.

507
00:37:08.351 --> 00:37:10.770
Yeah. yeah. I guess I should be happy.

508
00:37:10.854 --> 00:37:13.106
We did bring back the Positive Forces.

509
00:37:13.189 --> 00:37:15.066
and then there was
saving the entire city.

510
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:16.568
That should be good enough.

511
00:37:17.152 --> 00:37:18.361
A humble brag?

512
00:37:18.528 --> 00:37:20.280
Go ahead. girl. I see you.

513
00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:24.159
Look. here's to saving the world.

514
00:37:24.951 --> 00:37:27.036
friends and Team Flash.

515
00:37:27.412 --> 00:37:29.456
Or. as I like to call it.

516
00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:30.915
Team Badass.

517
00:37:30.999 --> 00:37:31.875
-Okay.
-Yeah.

518
00:37:31.958 --> 00:37:33.918
-Team Badass! Come on!
-Team Badass!

519
00:37:34.794 --> 00:37:36.421
Mm. Mm-mm.

520
00:37:38.339 --> 00:37:40.508
Okay. that is not a decaf latte.

521
00:37:40.592 --> 00:37:42.135
And this does not have three sugars.

522
00:37:42.302 --> 00:37:45.054
Cecile. I'm sorry.
I guess we mixed up coffees.

523
00:37:45.138 --> 00:37:46.055
I already. uh...

524
00:37:46.431 --> 00:37:47.599
No worries. it's fine.

525
00:37:53.813 --> 00:37:55.565
Cecile. did you do that?

526
00:37:55.857 --> 00:37:56.691
Uh...

527
00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:58.568
Yeah?

528
00:37:59.235 --> 00:38:00.069
But...

529
00:38:00.904 --> 00:38:03.239
Okay. all I did was think
I really wish I had the right coffee.

530
00:38:03.323 --> 00:38:04.532
And then I kind of saw it in my head.

531
00:38:04.616 --> 00:38:05.784
And then all of a sudden it was...

532
00:38:07.243 --> 00:38:10.038
Oh. the Force is strong with this one.

533
00:38:10.663 --> 00:38:11.498
Huh.

534
00:38:12.874 --> 00:38:13.792
Well...

535
00:38:15.418 --> 00:38:16.336
that's new.

536
00:38:23.551 --> 00:38:25.470
I never thought
I'd see you again.

537
00:38:27.597 --> 00:38:32.018
I don't mean to be rude or whatever.
but why am I here?

538
00:38:36.648 --> 00:38:37.607
Tinya.

539
00:38:38.733 --> 00:38:39.567
Mom?

540
00:38:40.527 --> 00:38:41.444
It's really you?

541
00:38:47.659 --> 00:38:49.202
I didn't know
if I'd ever get out of that place.

542
00:38:50.203 --> 00:38:52.163
I just knew I had to see you again.

543
00:38:53.456 --> 00:38:54.457
How did this happen?

544
00:38:55.124 --> 00:38:57.919
When Iris beat her time sickness.
it cured the Still Force. too.

545
00:38:58.378 --> 00:39:00.630
And then Renee showed up
back at home in Coast City.

546
00:39:02.298 --> 00:39:03.633
We have so much to catch up on.

547
00:39:05.343 --> 00:39:06.261
Thank you.

548
00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:07.971
You're welcome.

549
00:39:32.495 --> 00:39:33.621
Chamber malfunction?

550
00:39:34.789 --> 00:39:36.457
What do you mean. chamber malfunction?

551
00:39:43.047 --> 00:39:44.757
Frost. are you okay?

552
00:39:49.387 --> 00:39:50.305
Frost?

553
00:39:54.142 --> 00:39:55.184
Who the hell are you?

554
00:39:56.227 --> 00:39:57.145
A friend...

555
00:39:58.855 --> 00:39:59.772
I think.

556
00:40:11.743 --> 00:40:12.952
I never want to let you go.

557
00:40:14.871 --> 00:40:15.830
Then don't.

558
00:40:17.206 --> 00:40:18.917
I mean. I could stay like this all week.

559
00:40:19.584 --> 00:40:21.252
That works for me.

560
00:40:24.964 --> 00:40:27.091
Iris. last night.
I thought I lost you forever.

561
00:40:27.967 --> 00:40:29.385
because I couldn't feel our connection.

562
00:40:31.471 --> 00:40:33.765
Yeah. when I was in the time stone.
I couldn't feel you. either.

563
00:40:35.558 --> 00:40:37.310
That's why I knew
I had to get back to you.

564
00:40:39.562 --> 00:40:41.564
So. I reignited our spark.

565
00:40:43.316 --> 00:40:44.192
How?

566
00:40:47.028 --> 00:40:48.363
You're my lightning rod. too.

567
00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:58.122
Thank you.

568
00:40:58.665 --> 00:40:59.624
Seriously?

569
00:41:00.249 --> 00:41:02.126
I mean. I've been gone
for a while. but...

570
00:41:02.502 --> 00:41:05.463
For reminding me
that even the Flash has limits.

571
00:41:06.923 --> 00:41:08.591
Thawne couldn't accept that
about himself.

572
00:41:09.634 --> 00:41:11.052
Which is why he didn't survive.

573
00:41:17.433 --> 00:41:20.269
Barry. you know the Negative Speed Force
will need to find a new avatar.

574
00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:21.437
I know.

575
00:41:23.731 --> 00:41:25.358
Because the universe
is all about balance.

576
00:41:28.361 --> 00:41:29.654
Which means that one day.

577
00:41:29.904 --> 00:41:32.490
the Negative Forces
will have to pick one.

578
00:41:36.077 --> 00:41:37.370
I wonder who they'll choose.

579
00:41:39.747 --> 00:41:41.207
We won't know until it happens.

580
00:41:42.375 --> 00:41:47.171
But whenever that day comes.
and whoever that avatar is...

581
00:41:51.217 --> 00:41:52.260
we'll be ready for them.

582
00:41:52.284 --> 00:42:00.284
