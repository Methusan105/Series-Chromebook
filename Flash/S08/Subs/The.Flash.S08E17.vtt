﻿1
00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:05.255
What do we got. Chester?

2
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.424
Multiple fire alarms
at Ivo Labs.

3
00:00:07.508 --> 00:00:08.592
You know. hopefully. it's not

4
00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:12.513
an overcooked-chicken-tenders
in-the-microwave situation.

5
00:00:12.596 --> 00:00:14.473
/ said I was sorry for that.

6
00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:17.142
Roger that. Yeah. yeah.
It's just. you know. man...

7
00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:20.270
...that smell took us forever
to get out of the lounge.

8
00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:21.563
Hold on. hold on. hold on.

9
00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:23.482
Fire's already been put out.

10
00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:25.609
Flash. you're back.

11
00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:28.237
I just got here.

12
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.614
No. you didn't.
You sped us out of the way

13
00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.324
and then put out the fire
with a wind funnel.

14
00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:33.867
Like you did with The Hotness.

15
00:00:34.243 --> 00:00:35.077
I did?

16
00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:37.371
If it wasn't for your super-speed.

17
00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:41.083
seven years of research would have
gone up in smoke. Literally.

18
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.834
Yeah. you're welcome.

19
00:00:42.918 --> 00:00:45.587
Hey. Flash. what's goin' on?
What are they talkin' about?

20
00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:47.130
I don't know.

21
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.010
I think there may be
a new speedster in town.

22
00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:13.615
A new speedster? You sure?

23
00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:15.909
Those Ivo employees said
someone ran them to safety

24
00:01:15.993 --> 00:01:18.745
and then used a wind funnel
to put the fire out. just like I would.

25
00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:20.789
Well. that sure sounds like a speedster.

26
00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:23.041
Do you have any leads on
to who it might be?

27
00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:26.587
Not yet. August Heart's still
locked up at Iron Heights.

28
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.047
Thawne doesn't have his speed.
he's under heavy guard at A.R.G.U.S.

29
00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:32.384
And all the Velocity-X vials
are secure at S.T.A.R. Labs.

30
00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:34.386
And I still can't reach
Speed Force Nora.

31
00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.096
Or any of the other Forces.

32
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:40.225
Is there more?

33
00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:46.273
Just... Caitlin still hasn't
returned my calls

34
00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:49.067
since I stopped her experiment
to resurrect Frost.

35
00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:51.194
You did more than stop it.

36
00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:57.951
I'm not saying it's wrong.
but Caitlin lost

37
00:01:58.035 --> 00:02:00.245
the most important person
in the world to her.

38
00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.498
and she could lose something
just as important.

39
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:05.626
Hope.

40
00:02:07.586 --> 00:02:09.338
We are gonna be late.

41
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.381
-Oh! Hey.
-Hey.

42
00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:14.885
We've got kindergarten interviews
for Jenna at every school all day.

43
00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.346
The competition is crazy fierce.

44
00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:20.057
Um... Oh! Great.
you've got Jenna's backpack.

45
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.392
I have the paperwork.
I have the interview questions.

46
00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:25.103
You and I. we are gonna
go over that in the car. Um...

47
00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:27.939
What are we missing?

48
00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:29.733
Jenna?

49
00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:35.822
Hey.

50
00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:38.116
I need your notes on the profile feature
for Judge Hankerson's retirement.

51
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.284
Already in your inbox.

52
00:02:39.368 --> 00:02:41.620
And here's the briefing I wrote up
for your next field piece.

53
00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:44.498
They're closing Fort Delaney?
That's right up my alley.

54
00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:46.333
Allegra. did you sign off on my--

55
00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:48.085
Expense reports?
Yep. they're with accounting.

56
00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:49.753
-Okay. then.
-Allegra.

57
00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.923
I want to run an exposé on
the light meta who works with the Flash.

58
00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:00.847
Okay. I'll leave you to it.

59
00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:03.934
I've been pulling pictures.

60
00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.852
Whoever this is.
her face is always hidden by light.

61
00:03:05.936 --> 00:03:09.106
but I think I could ID her
with enough resources.

62
00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:10.982
Maybe she doesn't want to be ID'd.

63
00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:13.068
Well. we don't know that.

64
00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:15.779
And a new hero in town is big news.

65
00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:18.240
-That's why we should run this.
-No.

66
00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:22.369
I mean. it's not right for CCC Media.

67
00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:24.705
Says the temporary editor-in-chief.

68
00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:27.082
I already ran the story by Iris
before she left.

69
00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:29.000
What did she say?

70
00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:31.211
That it was an interesting angle

71
00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:33.463
and she would strongly consider it.

72
00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.425
Well. maybe we hold off
on moving forward with it

73
00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:37.426
until she's back.

74
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.354
I don't get it.

75
00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:53.024
I thought you left the Arafas after you
were paroled from Iron Heights.

76
00:03:53.108 --> 00:03:54.067
I did.

77
00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:56.194
But our old gang's trying
to pull me back in.

78
00:03:57.154 --> 00:03:58.822
The Arafias are expanding.

79
00:03:59.448 --> 00:04:01.533
They've taken over
every square inch of Keystone.

80
00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:02.993
and now they want Central City.

81
00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:05.370
The gang's been dropping bodies.

82
00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:07.080
What?

83
00:04:07.456 --> 00:04:09.958
The Aranas aren't killers.
We used to just steal cars.

84
00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:11.334
Not anymore.

85
00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.880
Thanks to new leadership.
there's no line they won't cross.

86
00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:16.923
Who are these people?

87
00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:18.800
The kind you don't want to mess with.

88
00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:20.343
Look...

89
00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:25.265
You did me a huge favor
when you wrote that article about me.

90
00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:29.770
And because of you. I was able to
make a new. better life in this city.

91
00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:31.605
And I don't want to give that up.

92
00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:35.233
But I have to leave.

93
00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:39.571
Because the same reason

94
00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:41.698
they want me to run things

95
00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:44.826
is the reason
I won't survive if I turn them down.

96
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.454
Lydia. if what you're saying is true.

97
00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:50.707
we have to stop them
before anyone else gets killed.

98
00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:51.792
We can't.

99
00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:55.754
What if you help
CCC Media break this story?

100
00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:58.507
Like you said.
you know everything about them.

101
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.469
Where they keep their money.
their contacts. their stash houses.

102
00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:05.013
Lydia.

103
00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:07.766
you're the only one
that can help me take them down.

104
00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.894
No way. You know what they'd do to me
for snitching?

105
00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:14.356
CCC Media will treat you
as an anonymous source.

106
00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:15.774
We'll protect you.

107
00:05:16.942 --> 00:05:17.859
How?

108
00:05:17.943 --> 00:05:20.987
I know someone who can
run you out of town quick

109
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:22.197
if something goes south.

110
00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:24.449
Look...

111
00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:26.326
I know you're scared.

112
00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:28.912
but the Aranas.

113
00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:30.997
they operate in the shadows.

114
00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:34.125
The only way to take away their power

115
00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.086
is bring them into the light.

116
00:05:37.963 --> 00:05:41.508
Think about
all the other girls in the gangs.

117
00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.761
The ones who are trying to get out.
but they can't.

118
00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:46.763
Telling your story

119
00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.891
could help them
get their lives back. too.

120
00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:52.602
Okay.

121
00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.273
But not here.

122
00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:01.194
And after our interview.
I'm on the first bus out of here.

123
00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.281
We'll keep you safe. I promise.

124
00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:10.370
I found Lydia.

125
00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:13.582
Looks like she's skipping town.

126
00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:15.917
That's not all she's doing.

127
00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:17.127
Rawlins.

128
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.380
Lydia's talking to Esperanza's cousin.
the reporter.

129
00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:22.924
We can't let them expose us.

130
00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:25.343
They won't.

131
00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:29.139
No one defies the Aranas and survives.

132
00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:42.944
So. I've been checking S.T.A.R Labs'
satellite readings all day.

133
00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:44.905
Not a stray tachyon to be found.

134
00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:47.532
Our new speedster
isn't using the Speed Force.

135
00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:48.700
And now they're in the wind.

136
00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:51.328
What's wrong?

137
00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:53.455
The fire's origin is here.

138
00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:55.874
but the only thing that
could have started it is this acetone.

139
00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:57.751
Even with an incredibly low flash point.

140
00:06:57.918 --> 00:06:59.628
it would still need an ignition source.

141
00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:02.839
Chester. what if this speedster

142
00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:04.549
was the combustion force?

143
00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:07.469
Oh. snap. Yeah. no.
The friction from their super-speed

144
00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:10.472
would totally be enough
to kick-start a reaction.

145
00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:12.974
And it would explain how they arrived
on scene before you.

146
00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.476
Because they started it.

147
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.186
But why?

148
00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.440
Look at this biometric lock.

149
00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:26.696
It's broken.

150
00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:34.537
And whatever was inside is MIA.
just like our speedster.

151
00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:36.456
But. man.

152
00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:38.333
the only reason you would need

153
00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.126
a temperature-controlled polymer case
like this

154
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.797
would be to hold
a very strong electrochemical cell.

155
00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:46.675
Like Ivo Labs' Newton battery.

156
00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:49.761
It's experimental.
but it's incredibly powerful.

157
00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:52.430
What if the fire was a distraction
so they could steal this?

158
00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:54.516
Damn.

159
00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:57.936
Yeah. okay. I guess we can scratch them
off the nice speedster list.

160
00:07:58.019 --> 00:07:59.187
What do we do now?

161
00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:01.147
We get answers from the one person

162
00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:03.525
who knows villainous speedsters
better than I do.

163
00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:07.070
Which means I'm gonna be off the grid.
so Team Flash is on its own for a while.

164
00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:08.655
You're gonna go see him?

165
00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:10.782
You sure that's a good idea?

166
00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:12.492
I have to know If it's him.

167
00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:16.788
Okay. Yeah. you do you.
We'll be fine here.

168
00:08:16.812 --> 00:08:18.812
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

169
00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:35.724
This is the Arafas gang.

170
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.768
For years. their M.O. was stealing cars.

171
00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:41.771
It was founded by a teenager in Keystone

172
00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:45.942
who later became known
as the meta-human Ultraviolet.

173
00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:47.610
Now. more recently.

174
00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:52.282
UV has worked alongside Millie Rawlins
and Dr. Kimiyo Hoshi.

175
00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.826
aka Sunshine and Dr. Light.

176
00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:57.162
Collectively known
as "The Assassins Three."

177
00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:59.831
they've worked for Black Hole
and Eva McCulloch.

178
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:02.959
Only. according to rumors.

179
00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:04.461
Ultraviolet died last year.

180
00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:05.962
And why should we care?

181
00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:08.381
Because I just found out

182
00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:11.134
Sunshine and Dr. Light
are now running the Aranas.

183
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:14.429
We're talking extortion.
million-dollar thefts

184
00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:16.181
that should be impossible.

185
00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:20.310
and they're leaving a trail of bodies
made from anyone who gets in their way.

186
00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:22.353
And you got all this from one source?

187
00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:24.981
Is there anyone else
who can corroborate her story?

188
00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:26.775
She is all we need.

189
00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:30.195
Which is why we're doing
a live interview with her.

190
00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:31.112
Tonight.

191
00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:35.575
I mean. you can't be serious. We'd have
no time to fact-check her story.

192
00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:38.161
And this source.
how do you even know she's reliable?

193
00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:40.830
-I just do.
-I don't get it.

194
00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:43.458
Why are you so passionate
about this story?

195
00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:48.129
Look. I know this sounds crazy.

196
00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:51.216
but I am telling you
it's the right move.

197
00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:53.718
You just have to trust
that I know what I'm doing.

198
00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.765
I'll. uh... I'll go call my babysitter.

199
00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:00.683
I'll DVR the Sharks game.

200
00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:09.526
Okay. let's do this.

201
00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:11.778
Chester. meet Lydia.

202
00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:13.279
Hi.

203
00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:15.740
We've got a skeleton staff tonight.
to protect her identity.

204
00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:18.868
And Lydia. don't worry.
I trust Chuck with my life.

205
00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:21.037
Uh. what do you do around here?

206
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:23.581
Tonight I'll be running
an Al-generated filter

207
00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:26.042
to conceal your voice and face
during the interview.

208
00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:27.418
SO. NO worries.

209
00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:29.254
Not even your mom
will recognize you.

210
00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:32.298
I need some water.

211
00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:37.887
Is. uh. she gonna be okay?

212
00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:39.139
Yeah.

213
00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:41.182
What about you?

214
00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:42.725
Yeah.

215
00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:46.646
'Cause reporting on the Aranas.
I know that's a big deal for you.

216
00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:49.566
How did your staff react when
you told them about your connection?

217
00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:51.985
I... 1 didn't tell them.

218
00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:54.863
Allegra. are you sure
that's the right move?

219
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.657
I need them to trust me.

220
00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.577
And if I tell them
I was in the Aranas...

221
00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:04.998
No. I can't risk them
losing faith in me.

222
00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:06.583
This story is too important.

223
00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:08.960
I'm gonna go check on Lydia.

224
00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:18.136
My stomach is doing flip-flops.

225
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.805
You're scared. I get it.

226
00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:25.685
But the risk we're taking.
it's worth it.

227
00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:29.856
Think about your life
before you joined the Aranas.

228
00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:36.154
Hmm. It was rough.

229
00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.075
I was on my own.

230
00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:43.536
struggling to get by.

231
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.457
Always wishing to be
a part of something. a family.

232
00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:50.585
And what I didn't know
was that it could get even worse.

233
00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:05.975
Yeah. but somehow
you got out without getting killed.

234
00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:07.518
I might not get so lucky.

235
00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:11.231
- What's happening?
- Get down.

236
00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:29.249
The Aranas.
I knew they'd find me.

237
00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:30.917
Okay. we have to get out of here. now.

238
00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:38.925
Hello. Lydia.

239
00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:44.722
Come on.

240
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:54.524
Sorry. ladies.

241
00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.569
It's the end of the road.

242
00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:15.712
Quick. in here!

243
00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:33.813
You can't keep me out forever.

244
00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:36.357
Who the hell was that?

245
00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:39.527
The Aranas are here. We're under attack.
She's hurt.

246
00:13:39.861 --> 00:13:40.778
I'm on it.

247
00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:43.239
This can't be happening.

248
00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:44.824
We need to get to a secure location.

249
00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:46.451
We're in one. I just activated

250
00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:48.286
a photo-kinetic energy shield
around the whole building.

251
00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:51.581
It's bulletproof. teleport-proof.
basically everything-proof.

252
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.500
How'd you know to do that?
You're just an IT guy.

253
00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:58.755
Back when we were The Citizen.

254
00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.840
Dr. Light attacked us.

255
00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:02.884
That's when Sue Dearbon
hired him to secure the building.

256
00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:04.552
Why isn't my phone working?

257
00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:07.722
They must be using a signal jammer
to block communications.

258
00:14:08.806 --> 00:14:10.224
-Frick.
-What is it?

259
00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:13.478
My force field was only meant
to be a temporary shield

260
00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:14.771
until we could call for help.

261
00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:16.272
And now we can't.

262
00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:18.441
Guys. she's back.

263
00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:21.944
I've been in combat.

264
00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:24.197
Knowing where your enemy is
is a good thing.

265
00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:25.782
Now we need a plan.

266
00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:28.326
Chuck. can you
MacGyver something together

267
00:14:28.409 --> 00:14:30.536
to bust through their cell jammers
and call for help?

268
00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:33.831
I can build an oscillating transmitter
to bypass their signals.

269
00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:37.835
Sunshine just flipping disappeared!

270
00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:41.672
Yeah. okay. We need to just remain calm.

271
00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:43.549
Until this force field goes critical.

272
00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:47.470
Hoshi can't fire her photon bullets.
and Sunshine can't teleport in.

273
00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.305
How do you know so much about them?

274
00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:51.516
Yeah. Allegra. how do you?

275
00:14:56.854 --> 00:14:57.772
Oh. my God.

276
00:15:13.704 --> 00:15:14.956
We need to talk. Thawne.

277
00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:18.084
You took my speed.

278
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.213
What more do you want?
My body is broken.

279
00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:25.258
I can barely think. I can't sleep.

280
00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:28.511
I used to be able
to run around the world

281
00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.140
in five seconds.
Now it takes me at least that long

282
00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:35.685
to cross this stupid cell because...

283
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.565
you took my speed.

284
00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:43.067
You did this to yourself. Thawne.

285
00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:45.570
Armageddon was your plan.

286
00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:47.238
And it should've worked.

287
00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:49.740
But...

288
00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:52.785
it didn't. And now...

289
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:57.123
I'll have to find a new way to kill you.

290
00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:00.835
Well. you can try.

291
00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:03.588
I've gotten what I need.

292
00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.216
Wait. you're out?
Wait. you're leaving me

293
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.135
just like that?

294
00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:11.554
No...

295
00:16:12.513 --> 00:16:15.141
parting gift? No 411

296
00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:16.851
on your precious

297
00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:18.936
"Team Flash"?

298
00:16:20.021 --> 00:16:21.397
And by the way...

299
00:16:24.775 --> 00:16:25.985
it's just

300
00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:28.362
too bad

301
00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:31.699
what happened to Frost. isn't it?

302
00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:34.327
Then again...

303
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.582
she was in over her head
from the beginning. wasn't she?

304
00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:41.626
Yeah. this was a waste of time.

305
00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:43.461
Wait. Allen. don't go.

306
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:45.755
Come on.

307
00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:51.636
That's no way to treat an old friend.
What do you want. huh?

308
00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:55.181
To see if you were responsible
for something impossible.

309
00:16:55.264 --> 00:16:56.432
And now I know

310
00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:58.392
you couldn't be.

311
00:16:59.894 --> 00:17:01.437
Responsible for what?

312
00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:04.690
What is it?

313
00:17:05.274 --> 00:17:09.403
What scared you so bad
that you had to run all this way

314
00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:12.073
just to be sure I was still here?

315
00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:15.034
I found a new speedster.

316
00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:19.705
Huh.

317
00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:24.877
They can't have Lydia.
so we stick to the plan.

318
00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:26.295
Chuck's working on the transmitter.

319
00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:28.214
And what if they get in here
before he's done?

320
00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:30.049
They threatened to kill us.

321
00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:32.093
She's right. They're an invading force.

322
00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:33.761
We need a plan B.

323
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.515
What. you're already
working on page one?

324
00:17:39.183 --> 00:17:42.186
I'm writing a letter to my kids
in case I die in here. okay?

325
00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:53.114
I give up!

326
00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:55.241
-You hear me? I surrender!
-Lydia. Lydia. stop.

327
00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:57.076
You can't give yourself up.

328
00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:58.578
You...

329
00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:01.497
Open the doors.

330
00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:03.666
What? No. Lydia. they'll kill you.

331
00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:05.001
They're gonna anyways.

332
00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:07.545
Now open the door
SO no one else has to die.

333
00:18:07.878 --> 00:18:08.754
Good call.

334
00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:13.217
Lydia. look.

335
00:18:13.384 --> 00:18:16.178
I get what you're trying to do.
and it is damn selfless.

336
00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:18.973
But there's got to be another way. okay?

337
00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:21.100
Don't forget why you came here.
You came here to stop them.

338
00:18:21.183 --> 00:18:23.644
I came here
SO no one else would get killed.

339
00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:24.895
Now let me out!

340
00:18:25.062 --> 00:18:26.230
Hey. if she wants to go. let her.

341
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.690
No way!

342
00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:29.692
We can't send someone
out there to die. Taylor.

343
00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:32.320
So what? We're just gonna sit here
instead and wait for them to fry us

344
00:18:32.403 --> 00:18:34.530
or shoot us
or whatever the hell it is they do?

345
00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:36.907
Open the damn doors.

346
00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:39.577
Lydia. I'm the only one
with the code to that shield.

347
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.537
And there's no way in hell
I'm giving it to you.

348
00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:44.040
Which means

349
00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:47.376
we're gonna help you survive this. Okay?

350
00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:51.547
You ain't never getting in.

351
00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:53.883
Now I'm mad.

352
00:18:58.721 --> 00:19:01.015
Wait. wait. wait. Let me take this.

353
00:19:03.184 --> 00:19:05.394
You people are
just as crazy as the Aranas.

354
00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:07.229
We promised to keep her safe.

355
00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:09.690
-You did. I didn't.
-Okay.

356
00:19:09.857 --> 00:19:11.859
We all just need to take a step back

357
00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:14.570
and figure out a new way out of this.

358
00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:17.948
‘cause that woman's life
depends on our next move.

359
00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:19.367
And what about our lives?

360
00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:21.577
The Arafias want Lydia. not us.

361
00:19:21.744 --> 00:19:24.163
We turn her over. they'll let us go.
I like that plan.

362
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.457
No. it doesn't matter what we do.

363
00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.250
they will not let us go. Not now.

364
00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:29.293
You don't know that.

365
00:19:30.544 --> 00:19:33.464
Look. I saw
the code Chester typed in earlier.

366
00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:37.093
And this is what Lydia wants.

367
00:19:38.052 --> 00:19:40.513
Hey. Lydia is our source.

368
00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:43.349
It is our duty as journalists
to protect her. no matter what.

369
00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:44.433
even from herself.

370
00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:47.103
An ethics lesson from you. really?

371
00:19:47.728 --> 00:19:49.063
Your whole past is unethical.

372
00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:51.982
What's she talking about?

373
00:19:52.066 --> 00:19:54.610
The reason Allegra knows so much
about the Aranas.

374
00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:56.779
They need to know
what you've been hiding.

375
00:19:57.071 --> 00:19:58.030
Taylor. don't.

376
00:19:58.656 --> 00:20:00.783
This is my life. my decision.

377
00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:01.784
Too late.

378
00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:06.205
Right before we were attacked.
I had a contact

379
00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:08.332
take a look at some of Allegra's
sealed juvie records.

380
00:20:08.499 --> 00:20:09.750
And guess what they found?

381
00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:12.169
Our ex-con co-worker

382
00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:14.755
was in a gang
with her cousin. Ultraviolet.

383
00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:18.217
The same gang
that's been killing people in Keystone.

384
00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:20.511
Allegra used to be one of them.

385
00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:23.180
One of the Aranas.

386
00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:25.349
Is this for real?

387
00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:29.061
I am so sorry
that I didn't tell you the truth.

388
00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:31.897
But we have to stick together.
we have to protect Lydia.

389
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:34.024
Stick together? You lied to us.

390
00:20:34.108 --> 00:20:35.609
And now it's gonna get us killed.

391
00:20:35.776 --> 00:20:38.279
She's right. We can't trust you.

392
00:20:53.419 --> 00:20:56.505
Okay. Once I finish this transmitter.
we can get out of here. okay?

393
00:20:57.006 --> 00:20:58.966
Why couldn't you
just let me go out there?

394
00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:01.343
‘Cause you came here
to do something important.

395
00:21:01.427 --> 00:21:04.013
You and Allegra are trying to drag
a bunch of killers out of the darkness

396
00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:07.099
and expose everything they're doing.
And you still can.

397
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.019
Why do you think
Hoshi and Rawlins are still out there?

398
00:21:11.061 --> 00:21:13.063
Because they're scared of you. Lydia.

399
00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:17.109
We need to get that emergency signal
out now. Chuck.

400
00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:18.819
Look. I just need a little more time.

401
00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:20.529
Well. we don't have it.

402
00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:23.908
Taylor just told everyone that I was
in the Araias. and now no one trusts me.

403
00:21:23.991 --> 00:21:25.868
Plus. she memorized your shield code.

404
00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:27.912
They are this close
to opening those doors.

405
00:21:32.374 --> 00:21:35.002
I never should've taken over
after Iris left.

406
00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:37.338
No. no. this isn't your fault.

407
00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:38.672
Yes. itis.

408
00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:43.135
I am not a leader. I never have been.

409
00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:49.266
You know how Esperanza
and I ended up in juvie?

410
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.936
I had an idea for a job.

411
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.648
We were gonna hit
a bunch of semis at a rest stop.

412
00:21:56.023 --> 00:21:57.316
It was my idea.

413
00:21:57.399 --> 00:21:59.568
so Esperanza put me in charge
of the whole thing.

414
00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:02.780
And I checked the trucks.

415
00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:06.534
And when it came time.
I told the girls it was clear.

416
00:22:06.617 --> 00:22:09.453
But I missed a driver.
and he had a shotgun.

417
00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:12.164
and one of my girls got hit
with a round.

418
00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:15.125
You know what was in that truck?

419
00:22:15.793 --> 00:22:17.044
Lawn furniture.

420
00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:21.173
Chuck. a girl almost died because of me.

421
00:22:25.261 --> 00:22:28.180
I am not cut out to lead anyone.

422
00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:33.143
All I'll do is get people hurt.
or worse.

423
00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:42.152
That's not true.

424
00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:46.198
Look. I was lost when you found me.

425
00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:49.952
I wanted out of the Arafas so bad.

426
00:22:50.494 --> 00:22:52.204
but I couldn't actually do it.

427
00:22:53.664 --> 00:22:55.332
And then you wrote that article
about me.

428
00:22:58.002 --> 00:22:59.962
And seeing how you saw me.

429
00:23:00.588 --> 00:23:02.089
as someone with a future.

430
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:04.842
it helped me reclaim my life.

431
00:23:06.468 --> 00:23:09.889
And today. I was terrified.
but you inspired me to come here

432
00:23:09.972 --> 00:23:12.641
because when you said
we could take down the Aranas.

433
00:23:13.017 --> 00:23:14.143
I believed you.

434
00:23:15.644 --> 00:23:16.604
I still do.

435
00:23:16.687 --> 00:23:17.771
She's right.

436
00:23:19.189 --> 00:23:21.233
You are a leader.

437
00:23:22.151 --> 00:23:24.486
And not in spite of your past.
but because of it.

438
00:23:26.822 --> 00:23:29.074
You're Allegra freakin' Garcia.

439
00:23:29.533 --> 00:23:31.368
You always know who you are

440
00:23:32.202 --> 00:23:33.412
and what you want to do.

441
00:23:33.913 --> 00:23:35.331
But you can't lead

442
00:23:35.915 --> 00:23:37.583
if you're trying to stay in the dark.

443
00:23:40.169 --> 00:23:42.546
So. Allegra. what do you want to do?

444
00:23:50.054 --> 00:23:52.932
They didn't leave behind
any tachyons after the fire.

445
00:23:54.725 --> 00:23:55.726
Could you tell if they were

446
00:23:55.809 --> 00:23:57.937
-tapping into the Negative Speed Force?
-How could I tell?

447
00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.397
You severed my connection. remember?

448
00:24:00.773 --> 00:24:03.108
But you time-traveled
before that. A lot.

449
00:24:03.817 --> 00:24:06.070
Did you ever sense
another speedster in 20227?

450
00:24:06.153 --> 00:24:07.821
Someone trying to hide their abilities?

451
00:24:07.905 --> 00:24:10.282
Can you really not see
how obvious this answer is?

452
00:24:11.992 --> 00:24:13.994
-Are you stupid?
-So enlighten me.

453
00:24:15.996 --> 00:24:16.830
No.

454
00:24:25.547 --> 00:24:26.507
Okay.

455
00:24:31.428 --> 00:24:32.471
I get it.

456
00:24:34.431 --> 00:24:35.724
You don't want to help me

457
00:24:36.225 --> 00:24:39.144
because even after all this...

458
00:24:43.565 --> 00:24:44.775
you're still jealous.

459
00:24:46.568 --> 00:24:48.028
I'm not jealous of you.

460
00:24:48.946 --> 00:24:51.532
-I pity you.
-l meant jealous of them.

461
00:24:51.865 --> 00:24:53.701
-Who?
-This new speedster.

462
00:24:54.034 --> 00:24:57.037
out there living a life you lost.

463
00:24:57.955 --> 00:24:59.331
While you can barely move.

464
00:24:59.748 --> 00:25:01.458
their journey is just beginning.

465
00:25:01.959 --> 00:25:03.544
Yours is already over.

466
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.174
What's it like
knowing you've been replaced?

467
00:25:12.678 --> 00:25:14.096
I won't be replaced.

468
00:25:15.848 --> 00:25:19.101
I will never be replaced.
because no speedster

469
00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:21.729
is ever gonna feel for you what I do!

470
00:25:22.187 --> 00:25:24.189
Hate. Hate.

471
00:25:24.606 --> 00:25:26.275
Hate. Hate!

472
00:25:27.526 --> 00:25:30.946
Pure and infinite hate. I...

473
00:25:31.947 --> 00:25:34.408
hid in plain sight for years
to be next to you.

474
00:25:34.491 --> 00:25:36.243
to be close to you. so I could hurt you.

475
00:25:36.326 --> 00:25:39.329
I devoted my life
so I could destroy yours!

476
00:25:39.413 --> 00:25:42.791
No speedster will ever replace me!

477
00:25:44.626 --> 00:25:46.462
No speedster will ever feel

478
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.339
what I felt.

479
00:25:49.423 --> 00:25:52.301
And because they don't.
this new speedster...

480
00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.346
doesn't care about you at all.

481
00:25:56.764 --> 00:25:57.806
And so.

482
00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:02.269
there's another reason
they don't want to be found.

483
00:26:02.686 --> 00:26:03.812
So what is it?

484
00:26:04.688 --> 00:26:05.898
You really don't see it?

485
00:26:12.488 --> 00:26:14.573
I guess I am faster than you after all.

486
00:26:14.656 --> 00:26:15.783
Think about it. Allen.

487
00:26:18.452 --> 00:26:19.995
A new speedster

488
00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:22.414
running through the city streets...

489
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.085
with frightening new speed.

490
00:26:28.003 --> 00:26:29.838
Just like you...

491
00:26:31.673 --> 00:26:33.050
eight years ago.

492
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:36.929
They're hiding because
they can't control their abilities.

493
00:26:39.181 --> 00:26:40.307
The fire was an accident.

494
00:26:53.654 --> 00:26:55.447
Look. I wish there was another way.

495
00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:58.826
but if we want to survive.
we have to give Lydia over now.

496
00:26:58.909 --> 00:27:01.161
-No.
-Lydia is not going anywhere.

497
00:27:01.328 --> 00:27:03.247
because I have a plan to get us all out.

498
00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:06.208
But for it to work.
I need you to trust me.

499
00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:07.543
Yeah. that's not gonna happen.

500
00:27:07.626 --> 00:27:09.628
Okay. We don't want to turn Lydia over.

501
00:27:09.711 --> 00:27:11.421
-but Taylor is right.
-I know.

502
00:27:12.131 --> 00:27:15.384
And the truth is. I was ashamed
of being in the Aranas.

503
00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:18.720
And I was afraid if I told you
the truth about my past

504
00:27:18.804 --> 00:27:20.097
that you would stop trusting me.

505
00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:23.016
I thought there was too much at stake

506
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.103
for me to be honest
about who I really am.

507
00:27:28.981 --> 00:27:33.986
But it was lying about my past
and keeping you in the dark

508
00:27:34.069 --> 00:27:35.571
that lost your trust.

509
00:27:38.991 --> 00:27:40.325
So. I'm done hiding.

510
00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:51.336
I'm the light-meta in those photos.

511
00:27:53.255 --> 00:27:56.466
And I've never really
told anyone that before.

512
00:27:56.842 --> 00:28:00.179
You're the one who's always helping
the Flash. the one saving people?

513
00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:11.440
And right now. I'm going to save us.

514
00:28:12.107 --> 00:28:14.526
All you have to do is trust me.

515
00:28:15.652 --> 00:28:17.070
Look.
Allegra is the real deal.

516
00:28:17.404 --> 00:28:19.948
If she says she has a plan. then I'm in.

517
00:28:21.408 --> 00:28:22.492
All in.

518
00:28:23.493 --> 00:28:24.578
Me. too.

519
00:28:26.955 --> 00:28:27.873
So.

520
00:28:28.749 --> 00:28:29.583
who's with me?

521
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:50.437
This is a photo-kinetic energy shield.

522
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.189
It'll take time to split the bonds.

523
00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:54.066
Not if we have the right weapon.

524
00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:56.401
Give me your ammo.

525
00:29:08.664 --> 00:29:09.790
And now we do.

526
00:29:25.973 --> 00:29:27.266
This is gonna be fun.

527
00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:32.521
Where are they?

528
00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:38.443
Easy. ladies.

529
00:29:40.654 --> 00:29:42.948
We can all still walk out of here
without a sunburn.

530
00:29:43.282 --> 00:29:45.993
We made you a real nice offer. Garcia.

531
00:29:46.535 --> 00:29:48.370
Give up the girl and live.

532
00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:50.831
Yeah. Then when you slink
back into the shadows.

533
00:29:50.914 --> 00:29:54.501
every other body you drop
makes CCC Media responsible?

534
00:29:55.127 --> 00:29:56.211
Not happening.

535
00:30:02.134 --> 00:30:03.593
Hurry. she's buying us time.

536
00:30:04.219 --> 00:30:06.763
Camera and sound are up.
How's the transmitter coming?

537
00:30:06.847 --> 00:30:09.099
-I just need to reset the encoder.
-Well. reset faster.

538
00:30:09.182 --> 00:30:10.684
If this crazy plan of hers
doesn't work--

539
00:30:10.767 --> 00:30:13.562
It will. We just need to trust Allegra.

540
00:31:54.704 --> 00:31:55.914
Nice trick.

541
00:31:56.415 --> 00:31:58.083
But I can feel how hard it is

542
00:31:58.583 --> 00:32:00.627
for you to maintain so much power.

543
00:32:04.798 --> 00:32:06.716
Because you can't beat me. Garcia.

544
00:32:07.467 --> 00:32:08.802
I'm not trying to.

545
00:32:10.011 --> 00:32:12.806
This is a Central City
Citizen Media Special Report.

546
00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.725
We're here today
with a very brave young woman.

547
00:32:16.726 --> 00:32:18.103
who's ready to come forward and talk

548
00:32:18.186 --> 00:32:20.230
about the gang activity
in Keystone City.

549
00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:21.898
Lydia Sanchez.

550
00:32:21.982 --> 00:32:24.651
can you tell us about
a group called the Aranas?

551
00:32:26.736 --> 00:32:28.738
I have been living in fear

552
00:32:29.698 --> 00:32:31.700
of the Arafas for a long time.

553
00:32:32.659 --> 00:32:35.662
And even when I agreed
to do this interview.

554
00:32:35.745 --> 00:32:38.665
I didn't want to show my face at first.

555
00:32:38.915 --> 00:32:41.626
But now I realize

556
00:32:42.461 --> 00:32:43.837
they are the ones who should be afraid.

557
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.632
Because we're the ones
dragging them into the light.

558
00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:50.093
So. to all the girls out there

559
00:32:50.177 --> 00:32:52.471
struggling to break free
of their control.

560
00:32:52.762 --> 00:32:53.847
look at me.

561
00:32:55.765 --> 00:32:56.725
I did it.

562
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:59.394
So can you.

563
00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:01.897
And who's running this gang?

564
00:33:03.231 --> 00:33:05.609
Their names are Millie Rawlins
and Kimiyo Hoshi.

565
00:33:09.112 --> 00:33:13.533
That interview is going out live
to millions of people across the city.

566
00:33:14.534 --> 00:33:17.913
If either of you try
to go after Lydia again

567
00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.040
or anyone on my staff.

568
00:33:20.415 --> 00:33:22.709
the whole world will know it was you.

569
00:33:25.003 --> 00:33:26.171
You can go now.

570
00:33:28.256 --> 00:33:29.216
This isn't over.

571
00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:31.384
Bring it on. bitch.

572
00:33:47.776 --> 00:33:50.237
Mr. Runk just showed me
the damage outside.

573
00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.822
and it looks like you two
had a rough night.

574
00:33:53.323 --> 00:33:55.116
How are the both of you still alive?

575
00:33:58.161 --> 00:33:59.412
I guess we're just lucky.

576
00:33:59.871 --> 00:34:02.207
Well. Hoshi and Rawlins' luck
is about to run out.

577
00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:05.085
I've got APBs out for both of them
across the whole state.

578
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.963
And the information you provided
helped us

579
00:34:08.046 --> 00:34:09.798
freeze their accounts
and seize their assets.

580
00:34:10.006 --> 00:34:12.884
Which means the Aranas
are out of business.

581
00:34:13.176 --> 00:34:15.762
Do you mind if I ask you
a few more questions at the station?

582
00:34:16.304 --> 00:34:19.558
Lydia. I think.
was trying to catch a bus.

583
00:34:20.767 --> 00:34:21.851
Not anymore.

584
00:34:30.694 --> 00:34:33.113
Twenty million views and counting.

585
00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:35.490
This is our biggest story yet.

586
00:34:37.075 --> 00:34:37.909
Wow.

587
00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:41.871
Guys.

588
00:34:42.706 --> 00:34:43.790
thank you.

589
00:34:45.166 --> 00:34:46.293
I owe you.

590
00:34:47.294 --> 00:34:49.838
Which is why...

591
00:34:49.921 --> 00:34:53.633
Look. if you need to expose
the truth about me.

592
00:34:54.342 --> 00:34:55.844
- I get it.
- Allegra.

593
00:34:55.969 --> 00:34:59.055
you reminded us today
of the oldest rule in the book.

594
00:34:59.472 --> 00:35:00.974
Always protect your sources.

595
00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:02.892
And each other.

596
00:35:05.812 --> 00:35:07.147
We're gonna keep your secret. too.

597
00:35:08.398 --> 00:35:10.525
For as long as you want us to.

598
00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:12.611
Thank you.

599
00:35:12.694 --> 00:35:15.905
Hey. did you put a call
into the Keystone PD Commissioner

600
00:35:15.989 --> 00:35:17.991
-to get a comment about the Arafnas?
-Already did.

601
00:35:18.325 --> 00:35:21.369
Let's hit our old contacts
at McCulloch Tech.

602
00:35:21.453 --> 00:35:22.662
- Yes.
- Guys.

603
00:35:22.746 --> 00:35:24.164
it's like 4:00 a.m.

604
00:35:24.247 --> 00:35:25.582
Yeah. that's what the coffee is for.

605
00:35:26.333 --> 00:35:28.084
Plus. we need to get a follow-up out.

606
00:35:28.376 --> 00:35:29.794
right after I call my babysitter.

607
00:35:30.211 --> 00:35:31.796
Probably gonna charge me
a fortune for this.

608
00:35:37.218 --> 00:35:38.303
You're not gonna join them?

609
00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.638
Seriously?

610
00:35:40.388 --> 00:35:42.015
You're not firing me for.

611
00:35:42.974 --> 00:35:44.643
you know. everything?

612
00:35:45.226 --> 00:35:48.021
You were trying to save
the lives of your co-workers.

613
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.397
So. no.

614
00:35:50.398 --> 00:35:51.274
Plus.

615
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:54.027
you're a great investigative reporter.

616
00:35:56.571 --> 00:35:58.448
Thanks for keeping us safe today.

617
00:35:59.032 --> 00:35:59.866
boss.

618
00:36:03.036 --> 00:36:08.083
Hey. those photos of me and Flash.
where did you find them?

619
00:36:08.291 --> 00:36:10.585
Chirper. It's not that hard. really.

620
00:36:13.338 --> 00:36:14.673
Um. Allegra.

621
00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:18.259
I know you're not hiding
from us anymore.

622
00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:21.805
but how long can you hide
from the rest of the world?

623
00:36:30.522 --> 00:36:32.273
Man. you should have seen her
last night.

624
00:36:32.357 --> 00:36:34.776
She totally crushed the leadership game.

625
00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:41.241
I'm talking Janeway-meets-AOC
meets-Angela-Davis-type leadership.

626
00:36:41.324 --> 00:36:43.868
Well. I don't know about Janeway.

627
00:36:44.828 --> 00:36:49.249
but. no. it was really nice
to just be myself.

628
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:52.711
Feel like I didn't have to hide.

629
00:36:53.086 --> 00:36:54.212
Nice work.

630
00:36:54.295 --> 00:36:55.839
You really stepped up. Both of you.

631
00:36:56.131 --> 00:36:58.633
And if Hoshi or Rawlins
make any more moves.

632
00:36:58.717 --> 00:37:00.260
obviously. I've got your back.

633
00:37:00.343 --> 00:37:01.302
Thanks.

634
00:37:01.386 --> 00:37:03.471
So. how did it go on Lian Yu?

635
00:37:04.139 --> 00:37:06.099
Did you find any answers
on the speedster?

636
00:37:06.182 --> 00:37:10.228
Uh... Yeah. not exactly. I did find some

637
00:37:11.229 --> 00:37:12.480
perspective.

638
00:37:13.732 --> 00:37:15.108
Incoming video message?

639
00:37:16.943 --> 00:37:17.902
Hey. guys.

640
00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:21.322
I wish I could've come back
to S.T.A.R Labs

641
00:37:21.406 --> 00:37:23.658
to tell you all this in person.

642
00:37:24.242 --> 00:37:26.745
but I can't go back there. Not yet.

643
00:37:27.162 --> 00:37:29.330
Barry. when you left my apartment.

644
00:37:29.831 --> 00:37:31.458
I wasn't sure how to feel.

645
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.586
And the truth is. I'm still not.

646
00:37:36.671 --> 00:37:37.881
I just know it hurts.

647
00:37:42.093 --> 00:37:44.846
So. I'm gonna go away
for a little while.

648
00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:46.431
I'm gonna stay with Carla.

649
00:37:47.056 --> 00:37:48.767
For real this time.

650
00:37:49.809 --> 00:37:51.853
I just need some space to think.

651
00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:56.232
And I don't know
when I'll be ready to come back.

652
00:37:56.316 --> 00:37:57.233
So.

653
00:37:58.193 --> 00:37:59.027
until then...

654
00:38:00.445 --> 00:38:02.530
just know that I love you all.

655
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:07.869
Is she gonna be okay?

656
00:38:09.412 --> 00:38:11.206
Yeah. I think she is.

657
00:38:33.353 --> 00:38:34.854
That's something
you don't see every day.

658
00:38:34.938 --> 00:38:36.773
Someone returning the tech they stole.

659
00:38:41.069 --> 00:38:43.279
Listen. hey. I just want to talk to you.

660
00:38:49.452 --> 00:38:50.703
Listen. I...

661
00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:55.625
I just have some questions.

662
00:39:28.867 --> 00:39:31.536
I can run at the speed
of sound. but you--

663
00:39:31.661 --> 00:39:34.998
Can run a lot faster than that.
Look. the point is. you can't outrun me.

664
00:39:35.081 --> 00:39:37.000
So why don't you just tell me who
you are and what's really going on?

665
00:39:37.083 --> 00:39:40.545
Look. I'm not a super-villain.
That fire was an accident.

666
00:39:40.628 --> 00:39:43.339
I know. But you risked people's lives
to steal a battery.

667
00:39:43.423 --> 00:39:45.091
And I'm so sorry about that.

668
00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:49.053
I'm not a natural speedster like you.

669
00:39:50.638 --> 00:39:52.056
That's why you've been so hard to trace.

670
00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.766
-Your speed's temporary.
-Exactly.

671
00:39:53.892 --> 00:39:55.268
You see. my...

672
00:39:56.686 --> 00:40:00.773
associate and I found a way
to generate my own speed source.

673
00:40:00.857 --> 00:40:04.152
I'm still trying to work out the kinks.
so the effects only last a few minutes.

674
00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:06.070
I thought maybe the battery
could help extend the window.

675
00:40:06.154 --> 00:40:08.197
and I figured
why spend another four years

676
00:40:08.281 --> 00:40:09.908
calibrating sodium nitrate cells

677
00:40:09.991 --> 00:40:14.495
when I could just borrow
the one I'd already made?

678
00:40:16.039 --> 00:40:19.417
I designed the original Newton battery
when I was a young engineer

679
00:40:19.876 --> 00:40:21.210
working here at Ivo.

680
00:40:21.669 --> 00:40:24.422
The Newton battery
was invented by Meena Dhawan.

681
00:40:34.015 --> 00:40:37.185
It's Dr. Meena Dhawan. actually.

682
00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.980
You're the CEO of Fast Track Labs.

683
00:40:41.064 --> 00:40:42.815
Your book.
Quantum Gravity & the Universe.

684
00:40:42.899 --> 00:40:45.610
I've read it three times.
You're a genius.

685
00:40:45.693 --> 00:40:48.863
That's surprising.

686
00:40:49.656 --> 00:40:50.740
And very flattering.

687
00:40:52.283 --> 00:40:54.702
Unfortunately. this genius intellect

688
00:40:54.786 --> 00:40:57.497
hasn't been any help
in mastering these new abilities.

689
00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:00.166
That's why I've been trying
to take a low profile.

690
00:41:00.249 --> 00:41:01.584
running trials with my team.

691
00:41:02.001 --> 00:41:03.169
The truth is...

692
00:41:04.545 --> 00:41:06.673
I just want to use my gifts
to help people.

693
00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:09.384
Well. I'm glad to hear that.

694
00:41:11.886 --> 00:41:14.138
When I first got my speed. I...

695
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:16.474
I had a mentor.

696
00:41:16.557 --> 00:41:20.269
Someone to coach me
on how to use my powers.

697
00:41:20.687 --> 00:41:21.896
So. if you're interested...

698
00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:25.108
You'd really do that for me?

699
00:41:30.697 --> 00:41:31.531
Thank you.

700
00:41:33.199 --> 00:41:34.951
I promise you won't regret this.

701
00:41:34.975 --> 00:41:42.975
