WEBVTT

ï»¿1
00:00:04.463 --> 00:00:08.884
I now pronounce you
husband and wife... again.

2
00:00:20.604 --> 00:00:22.356
You know. even though future you

3
00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.984
told us about your vow renewals.
like. a million times.

4
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:27.528
I still got pretty weepy.

5
00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:28.737
Me. too.

6
00:00:28.904 --> 00:00:31.365
I mean. the love in this room
when you two kissed...

7
00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:34.201
We have such an amazing future
ahead of us.

8
00:00:36.078 --> 00:00:37.496
Yeah. if we didn't change it.

9
00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:41.291
I checked with Gideon. no changes
to the timeline. everything's fine.

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.129
Well. on that note. we should be
getting back to 2049 sooner or later.

11
00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:47.130
Yeah.

12
00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:49.299
Keep the future safe.

13
00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:52.302
You're both gonna make great heroes.

14
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:54.054
-l already am.
-Yes.

15
00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:56.890
I will make you proud. Dad.

16
00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:00.060
I know.

17
00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:05.440
Love you both.

18
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:25.127
Okay. everything seems the same.

19
00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.922
It was so good to see Uncle Jay
and Aunt Joan again.

20
00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:36.179
Is it weird that seeing Uncle Jay alive
just made me miss him more?

21
00:01:48.984 --> 00:01:49.943
What was that?

22
00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:51.737
I have no idea.

23
00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:57.951
Okay. kids.
I come bearing cheeseburgers.

24
00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:00.871
Who's hungry?

25
00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:03.665
Uncle Jay!

26
00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:05.834
You were expecting someone else?

27
00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:07.919
Bart.

28
00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:10.922
-are you okay. son?
-No!

29
00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:12.382
Oh. okay.

30
00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:13.550
We just...

31
00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.385
We just missed you so much.

32
00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:16.511
Aw.

33
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:35.155
He's alive.

34
00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:36.114
Uncle Jay is alive!

35
00:02:36.198 --> 00:02:38.659
Our Uncle Jay.
he's really... Did we do this?

36
00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:41.453
We did. didn't we?
Oh! This is so crash.

37
00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:42.663
Cra... No!

38
00:02:42.913 --> 00:02:46.333
No. not crash. the opposite of crash.

39
00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:50.087
Look. that was a temporal wave
that washed over us. okay?

40
00:02:50.212 --> 00:02:54.174
That means that when we went back to
help Mom and Dad stop the Godspeed war.

41
00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:55.509
we changed the future.

42
00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:59.971
Kill The Adversary and his allies.

43
00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:02.265
Yeah. but in a good way.

44
00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:09.106
Well. yeah. totally. But we have to
figure out why the change has happened.

45
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.194
So...

46
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.739
Are. um. Mom and Pops gonna be

47
00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.117
swinging by anytime soon?

48
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.705
Aren't they in Milan for
their anniversary at La Verita Rustica?

49
00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.373
-Right!
-Yes.

50
00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:30.127
Yes. the anniversary
of their wedding vow renewal.

51
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.670
Mm-hmm. Um...

52
00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:33.797
But the rest of Team Flash
could pop by. right?

53
00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:38.093
Well. they're all kind of busy.
which you already know.

54
00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:40.554
Now. why the third degree?

55
00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:42.556
Oh...

56
00:03:42.973 --> 00:03:45.726
-Oh. nothing. we're fine.
-Yeah. no. we... yeah.

57
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:48.103
Bart's fine. I'm fine. Fine. fine. fine.

58
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.814
Well. thanks to your brother.

59
00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:55.694
When that psychopath Godspeed
came for me a few months ago.

60
00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:57.904
I thought my race
might be finally finished.

61
00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:00.490
But then. Impulse saved the day.

62
00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:05.787
prevented Godspeed
from destroying our total reality.

63
00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:08.832
just like your dad always does.

64
00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:13.587
That's how I know you'll make
a great Flash one day. Bart.

65
00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.762
Oh. Aunt Rose!

66
00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:25.348
Sends her love.
her botany club's running late again.

67
00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:27.434
Who's Aunt Rose?

68
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:30.395
Rose.

69
00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:33.315
My wife?

70
00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.194
What is up with you two tonight?

71
00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:47.996
So. that's how we did this?

72
00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:54.127
Yeah. when we chased Godspeed
through time using the cosmic treadmill.

73
00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:58.089
only it wasn't built to handle
the energy of three speedsters at once.

74
00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:01.927
Our tachyon energies must have
caused massive temporal fissures.

75
00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:05.430
Oh!

76
00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.725
This is why Dad has time travel rules.

77
00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:11.770
According to this. Uncle Jay
never married Aunt Joan.

78
00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:16.942
Oh. my God! We erased her.

79
00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:20.028
We erased her.
My gauntlet just confirmed it.

80
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:23.031
Is that one of those fissures
that we caused?

81
00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.285
I'm sorry. how far back does it go?
How many are there? Can we fix them?

82
00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.704
Keep your voice down.

83
00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:37.170
Okay. we work backwards. identifying
everything new to the timeline.

84
00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:39.422
figure out where things
first started changing.

85
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.341
and put them back
where they're supposed to be.

86
00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:42.801
Okay.

87
00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:45.679
Corrupt Mayor Bellows Jr.

88
00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:48.557
farther back. Trickster invades Tibet.

89
00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.267
farther back...

90
00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.853
- Who's Booster Gold?
- Keep going.

91
00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:58.483
"Zoom attacks C.C.P.D.
Chief of Police Joe West."

92
00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:01.653
Grandpa Joe wasn't Chief then. right?

93
00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:03.196
But he is in this new timeline.

94
00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:04.614
When did he get promoted?

95
00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:09.452
There are no time fissures before that.

96
00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:11.872
This is where the change happened.

97
00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:14.207
and it altered everything
that follows. like dominos.

98
00:06:14.291 --> 00:06:17.252
Okay. "Detective Joe West heroically
took a bullet during a jewelry theft.

99
00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:19.462
the afternoon of December 31st. 2013."

100
00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:21.965
And Dad couldn't help him
because he was still in a coma.

101
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.550
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

102
00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:27.679
If we save Grandpa Joe from getting
shot. things will return to normal.

103
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.639
and we get Aunt Joan back.

104
00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:31.224
New Year's Eve. 2013.

105
00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:32.809
here we come.

106
00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:42.611
What the hell are you wearing?

107
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:43.778
Something sexy.

108
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.157
It's smart. I'm incognito.

109
00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:50.493
Dude. it's 2013. not 1913.

110
00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:52.120
Look. there's Grandpa Joe.

111
00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:58.293
I... haven't done this in a long time.

112
00:06:58.376 --> 00:06:59.628
What am I supposed to say?

113
00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:02.255
Breathe. Detective. You got this.

114
00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:09.054
Hey!

115
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.389
Counselor Horton. how are you?

116
00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:14.643
I am crappy. Detective West.
so if you don't mind. I'm just gonna--

117
00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:19.814
Yeah. Sorry.
we are celebrating New Year's here--

118
00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:21.816
Oh. God. okay.
I'm gonna stop you right there.

119
00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:25.570
Two things. One.
I have a ton of paperwork

120
00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:27.113
back on my desk at the DA's office

121
00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:29.741
and two. this one's important.
pay attention.

122
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.536
All men... are jerks.

123
00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:35.038
No offense.

124
00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:37.207
None taken.

125
00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:39.250
Great! Happy New Year.

126
00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:42.837
Damn.

127
00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:46.675
Sorry. Detective.

128
00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:49.761
Then again. her divorce
just finalized last week.

129
00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:51.012
That wasn't worth mentioning?

130
00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:55.058
I was gonna. but it just seems like
you two would make such a great pair.

131
00:07:57.268 --> 00:08:00.647
Is today the day that Grandpa Joe
and Grammy Cecile start dating?

132
00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:01.773
No.

133
00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:03.775
I mean. I don't think that it is.

134
00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:07.487
Okay. good. because stopping
Grandpa Joe from getting shot.

135
00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:09.155
it's enough fixing for one day.

136
00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:10.156
Okay.

137
00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:12.993
Remember what we learned in 2049.

138
00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:15.203
We have to stop what happens today.

139
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.122
and we cannot interact with anyone

140
00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:19.499
who is connected to our family
while we are doing it.

141
00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:24.212
Relax. no one's going to find out
who we are or why we're here.

142
00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:31.594
Who are you two... and why are you here?

143
00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:44.024
Well...

144
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:46.484
how about it?

145
00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:47.694
Yes. of course.

146
00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:49.154
Here you go. Detective.

147
00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:52.741
Nora Moy and Bart Wade.

148
00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:55.827
We're intern CSI's.
We are here to help out

149
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.329
because we heard that
one of your CSl's is...

150
00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:00.373
-Under the weather.
-...under the weather.

151
00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:04.127
That's it. just crime fighters.

152
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:08.048
Couple of crime fighters. with science.

153
00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:12.886
Sorry. it's been tense here
since the accident at S.T.A.R. Labs.

154
00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:15.722
My new partner barely speaks to me.

155
00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:18.141
Get him a cup of coffee.

156
00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:22.228
I find the Java
really brings people together.

157
00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:23.188
Yeah.

158
00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:25.482
That is a great idea.

159
00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:29.235
I want to buy the entire bullpen
coffee from the cart outside.

160
00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:31.237
Take their orders. It's on me.

161
00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:34.032
Maybe this will help break the ice.

162
00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:39.746
Detective. we have so much science
to get done today.

163
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:41.956
so I don't know
if we're going to be able to...

164
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.541
-It's a lot.
-We do

165
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.836
have science.
but we are more than happy to help out.

166
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.130
and we will be back
in a flash. Detective.

167
00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:52.550
Can you leave Detective West's
and mine on our desks while we're out?

168
00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:54.803
Thanks a lot. guys.

169
00:09:58.515 --> 00:10:02.560
That's the guy! That's the guy!
That's the guy that sacrificed himself

170
00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:04.813
to stop Eobard Thawne. Mom's old fiancÃ©.

171
00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:07.482
-Yes. it is.
-Ow.

172
00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:08.858
And now we are his coffee gophers.

173
00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:11.152
when we're supposed to be
looking out for Grandpa Joe.

174
00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:21.079
I'll take a hazelnut mocha latte.

175
00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:27.418
This is ridiculous! Can I not just use
my superspeed instead. please?

176
00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:31.214
What part of "don't change the timeline"
do you not understand?

177
00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:34.342
Bart. unless we are absolutely
100% certain

178
00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:36.719
that it won't make things worse.
we can't use our speed.

179
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.721
But...

180
00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:41.808
Come on. Bart. I need you
to focus on the plan.

181
00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:44.102
I have my gauntlet set to alert us

182
00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:46.688
as soon as the jewelry robbery
goes down. okay?

183
00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:48.273
That is where Grandpa Joe will be.

184
00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:50.900
Right. and then we swoop in
and we save the day. that's fantastic.

185
00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:52.986
But you do realize that every second
that we're standing here.

186
00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:57.448
Grandpa Joe could be getting shot.
like now. or now. or right now you see--

187
00:10:57.532 --> 00:10:58.658
Holy crap. stop!

188
00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:01.953
No. because Grandpa Joe's safety
is on the line. and I need a coffee now!

189
00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:03.413
Oh. I'm so sorry.

190
00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:06.249
-I just didn't see you.
-That's called inattentional blindness.

191
00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.418
It's a phenomenon when an individual...

192
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.214
-Hi.
-Hi.

193
00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:15.884
I'm Bart.

194
00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:17.177
And you're?

195
00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:20.763
You're studying temporal dynam...

196
00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:22.849
How do you know
so much about quantum divergence?

197
00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:25.935
Well. now. that's a surprise.

198
00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:28.188
Tell you what. can you keep a secret?

199
00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:29.272
Oh. yeah. definitely.

200
00:11:29.772 --> 00:11:32.108
-I'm from the future!
-No way. me. too! What year?

201
00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:33.818
No dude. I'm totally messing with you.

202
00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:35.612
Time travel is impossible.

203
00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.530
Yeah...

204
00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:40.450
but it is possible though.
mathematically.

205
00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:43.494
if I'm reading
the title of your thesis correctly.

206
00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:45.914
Yeah. I'm trying to prove
that Tolman's paradox

207
00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:47.582
can give rise to quantum superposition.

208
00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:50.668
and that tachyon exchanges between
two particles can generate superposition

209
00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:53.046
and entangle molecular pairs.
Of course. it's the causal paradox

210
00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:54.797
I'm still trying to solve.

211
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:59.093
Oh. my God. you're like
the Elon Musk of your generation.

212
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.139
Yeah. I'm pretty sure Elon Musk
is my generation's Elon Musk.

213
00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:04.724
-Well. I mean...
-I'm Avery.

214
00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:08.811
And I'm Nora. his sister. and we should
really go. We have that thing.

215
00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:11.439
Yeah. right. Yeah. we have that...

216
00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:15.318
Avery. your research
is bleeding edge impressive.

217
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:17.820
Can you tell that to my boss
at Fast Track Labs?

218
00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:21.282
Just once. I'd like to help run research
instead of running for coffee.

219
00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:22.867
But. that's the intern life.

220
00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:24.452
-You know what. I'm an intern. too!
-No way!

221
00:12:24.535 --> 00:12:25.787
-Yeah. we just got coffees...
-Yeah. actually. you know what.

222
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.831
we both are. we both are interns.
and we should really go now.

223
00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:30.124
That call we were waiting for?

224
00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:31.251
-Yes.
-It just came in.

225
00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:32.168
Oh. that one.

226
00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:33.086
Um...

227
00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:35.380
Yeah. it was really crash meeting you.

228
00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:37.757
Is that a good thing?
If it's a good thing and you want to run

229
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.051
into me again. I make a coffee run
every afternoon.

230
00:12:40.134 --> 00:12:41.469
That's good to know. Nice to meet you.

231
00:12:41.552 --> 00:12:42.845
-This is you...
-Thank you.

232
00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:44.305
-Bye.
-Bye. Bye.

233
00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:46.391
Bye.

234
00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:56.693
You watch the back entrance.
I'll watch the front.

235
00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:57.777
Backup's en route.

236
00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:04.325
- Drop your weapon!
- Freeze!

237
00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:06.536
Hey! This is a real gun.

238
00:13:07.036 --> 00:13:08.788
Real bullets inside!

239
00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:12.667
Kid. have you ever even
held a gun before?

240
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.044
Yes. This isn't my first heist.

241
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.756
Listen. most thieves don't wear
what they just stole.

242
00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:23.303
Yeah. I forgot a bag. all right?

243
00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:25.346
Hey. listen. I am only taking

244
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.141
the ethically sourced
conflict-free diamonds.

245
00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:30.810
No blood diamonds for me. No. sir.

246
00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:33.980
Listen. lower your weapon
before you have an accident.

247
00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:36.232
Why don't you lower your weapon?

248
00:13:40.194 --> 00:13:41.029
Stop!

249
00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:43.656
If Grandpa Joe
was never supposed to be here.

250
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.575
then the gun was never
supposed to fire at all.

251
00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:47.243
We can't cause another temporal flux.

252
00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:48.578
Okay. you're just now mentioning that.

253
00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.246
Well. I tried to
when we were in the coffee line.

254
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.331
but someone was too busy flirting.

255
00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:53.207
-What do we do?
-Okay. um...

256
00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:56.127
We need to examine our variables.
and we need to form a plan.

257
00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.963
-First we need to consider--
-Oh. my God. I've got this!

258
00:13:58.987 --> 00:14:00.987
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

259
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.700
I am so sorry.

260
00:14:27.784 --> 00:14:29.744
Those things are way heavier
than they look in the movies.

261
00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:31.162
Turn around. hands behind your back.

262
00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:33.206
-That was an accident.
-Hands behind your back!

263
00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:35.208
I heard a shot.

264
00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:36.834
-Are you...
-I'm fine. Detective.

265
00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:38.795
You must have a guardian angel.

266
00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:43.174
You shouldn't have done that.

267
00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:45.051
So I moved Grandpa Joe
instead of the bullet.

268
00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:46.594
-What's the big deal?
-This.

269
00:14:49.013 --> 00:14:51.766
Look. now. more temporal particles
are in flux.

270
00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:54.185
Bart. you made everything worse.

271
00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.239
I don't even get it.

272
00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:09.992
He wasn't even a meta-human with powers.

273
00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:12.829
Well. now more metas are gonna be
turning up everywhere

274
00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:15.581
now that the particle accelerator
exploded...

275
00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:16.958
Meta-human?

276
00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:20.044
Then I'm not alone.

277
00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:33.474
Bart. the whole timeline's in flux.

278
00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:35.643
You might have changed the future
even more now.

279
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.728
What did I do?
I saved Grandpa.

280
00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:40.148
By moving Grandpa Joe
instead of moving the bullet.

281
00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:43.234
you created a new series of events
changing the timeline.

282
00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:45.695
It's what I would have warned you about
if you hadn't rushed in.

283
00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:47.738
Okay. okay. Why don't we just go back
in time 15 minutes

284
00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:49.991
and see for ourselves what we did wrong?

285
00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:53.786
Oh. okay. So you want to
fix our time travel screw ups

286
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.371
by traveling back in time.

287
00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:56.456
Again.

288
00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:57.999
Well. when you say it like that...

289
00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:04.422
Actually. there is a way
to observe the past without altering it.

290
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.175
I bet you that's the flash drive

291
00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:08.801
with the surveillance footage
from the shooting.

292
00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:11.179
-All we have to do is watch it--
-And see what went wrong.

293
00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.681
Okay. follow my lead.

294
00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:15.266
Don't go rogue.

295
00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:20.438
Excuse me. Detective Thawne.

296
00:16:21.397 --> 00:16:23.733
Is that the surveillance footage
of the incident?

297
00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:26.861
The interns. Yes. it is. Why?

298
00:16:26.944 --> 00:16:29.447
Hi. by the way.
We just figured you're doing

299
00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.657
so much detecting around here
that we could just take this

300
00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:33.117
back to the to the police station.

301
00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:34.952
-And then we'll just give it back to--
-No. thanks.

302
00:16:37.121 --> 00:16:38.664
You two should make another coffee run.

303
00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:40.041
We already did that.

304
00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:42.251
Did you?

305
00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:44.712
Then why am I not holding
a decaf cappuccino?

306
00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:48.674
Let us do this work
and you two do yours.

307
00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:51.469
-Right away. Detective.
-Yeah. right away.

308
00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:54.263
-We got to get that footage.
-We got to get that footage.

309
00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:57.183
Let me get this straight.

310
00:16:57.266 --> 00:16:59.310
Nobody knows
why the three of us are here.

311
00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:01.145
Feels like we've been set up.

312
00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:04.899
So. a woman's voice is in our heads.

313
00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:07.068
Telling us all there's a job tonight.

314
00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:12.198
Now. if you two jokers didn't promise
a score... who did?

315
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:15.868
Me. big fella.

316
00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:17.870
Pool table.

317
00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:27.338
Utopia Casino's ringing in the New Year
with the biggest fÃ©te in town.

318
00:17:27.588 --> 00:17:32.093
More guests means more bets
means more cash they'll need to cover.

319
00:17:32.343 --> 00:17:34.637
They'll have ten mil in the vault. easy.

320
00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:36.389
Not the worst plan.

321
00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:40.101
But the party starts in six hours.
There's no prep time.

322
00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:42.144
What if the cops show?

323
00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:44.272
I'll know they're coming before they do.

324
00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:47.858
âCause ever since
that Particle Accelerator exploded.

325
00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:51.070
I can hear people's thoughts.

326
00:17:51.195 --> 00:17:53.364
Now. I thought I was the only one
with gifts.

327
00:17:53.781 --> 00:17:55.700
Until I learned a new word.

328
00:17:56.367 --> 00:17:58.494
Meta-human.

329
00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:04.750
It means we're all something more now.

330
00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:06.794
Something greater.

331
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.589
And I am done living in fear.

332
00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:11.799
Now. who's game?

333
00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:16.887
I'm sick of hiding who I am.

334
00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:21.934
Soam I.

335
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.484
Watch it. Jack.

336
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.779
See? Doesn't that feel better?

337
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.282
And with our powers. no one can stop us.

338
00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:39.327
And if they try. I'll know what they're
planning before they even think it.

339
00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:41.662
So you're the ace up our sleeve.

340
00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:44.498
No. She's a queen.

341
00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:55.301
How are we gonna get that
flash drive without Grandpa noticing?

342
00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:58.387
Watch. okay?

343
00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:00.848
And learn.

344
00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:02.892
Okay. I get it.

345
00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:04.644
I'm the new guy.

346
00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:06.062
You're busy.

347
00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:10.107
And I heard you just lost your partner.
which has got to be tough.

348
00:19:11.025 --> 00:19:13.986
Plus. one of our CSl's in a coma.
Then on top of all that.

349
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.113
you get shot down by Counselor Horton.

350
00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:17.490
Who told you that?

351
00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:18.741
Uh...

352
00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:20.701
Everyone?

353
00:19:23.454 --> 00:19:25.706
You could try lilacs and crumb cake.

354
00:19:26.082 --> 00:19:27.375
Those are her favorites.

355
00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:31.295
That's good advice.

356
00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:36.926
-Who was that?
-One of our new interns.

357
00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:39.679
They're a little weird.

358
00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:48.020
Okay.
Now we can see where we messed up.

359
00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:49.980
This is where it happened.

360
00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:54.735
Where Dad was struck by lightning.

361
00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:14.880
I got it.

362
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.136
Ooh! Super speedy save.

363
00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:23.931
But hang on. I know her.

364
00:20:25.683 --> 00:20:28.310
Oh. my God. That's Mona Taylor...

365
00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:32.648
aka The Queen. As in the telepathic
leader of the Royal Flush Gang.

366
00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:33.941
What is she doing here?

367
00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:39.071
Since when is there
a casino heist tonight?

368
00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:42.992
The RFG didn't team up
until way after Dad put the suit on.

369
00:20:43.534 --> 00:20:46.162
After Mona discovered
that there are other metas.

370
00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:48.372
How could she possibly even know that
this soon?

371
00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:55.129
Oh. Bart. she got the idea
to form the RFG years early from us.

372
00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:58.132
And now 30 people
are going to die from a bomb.

373
00:20:58.257 --> 00:21:02.178
No. no. no. no. no. no. no.
We have to stop that heist.

374
00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:03.929
Do you think I don't know that?

375
00:21:04.013 --> 00:21:07.933
But if we start screwing with it again.
we could screw things up even worse.

376
00:21:08.017 --> 00:21:09.518
What are we supposed to do then?

377
00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:10.770
I don't know.

378
00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:13.355
But we'll figure it out
just like we always do.

379
00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:15.316
Dad would have gotten it right
the first time.

380
00:21:22.573 --> 00:21:24.408
-Bart. don't go there.
-Why not?

381
00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:28.078
-It's true.
-Listen to me.

382
00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.915
Whatever happened.
it's both of our faults.

383
00:21:30.998 --> 00:21:33.501
-We are in this together.
-Well. maybe we shouldn't be.

384
00:21:39.006 --> 00:21:40.549
Every single thing I did today...

385
00:21:42.593 --> 00:21:43.761
made everything worse.

386
00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:50.851
I am not good enough.

387
00:21:54.438 --> 00:21:55.856
And I will never be The Flash.

388
00:22:18.128 --> 00:22:19.672
Spoiler alert. Pops.

389
00:22:21.048 --> 00:22:22.299
Your son's a big screw up.

390
00:22:31.684 --> 00:22:34.186
-I knew you'd be here.
-I let him down. sis.

391
00:22:34.937 --> 00:22:38.148
-Bart. listen to me. Nobody is perfect.
-You are.

392
00:22:38.315 --> 00:22:40.192
-That is not true.
-Yes. it is.

393
00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.736
You knew when to come back here.

394
00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:45.990
You got the flash drive.

395
00:22:46.073 --> 00:22:49.451
You even helped Grandpa Joe
and Grammie Cecile. You...

396
00:22:50.536 --> 00:22:51.704
Yeah. you're perfect.

397
00:22:57.042 --> 00:22:58.502
I'm a complete failure.

398
00:22:58.961 --> 00:22:59.920
No.

399
00:23:00.796 --> 00:23:04.258
No. you're not. I failed a lot. too.

400
00:23:04.925 --> 00:23:09.263
For a long time. I fumbled
with my powers. I doubted myself.

401
00:23:10.556 --> 00:23:11.974
But that's how we learn.

402
00:23:12.933 --> 00:23:15.394
And yeah. every time I fell...

403
00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.646
Dad picked me up.

404
00:23:18.939 --> 00:23:22.401
Just like every time you fall.
I am going to pick you up. too.

405
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:27.323
Just remember what Dad always says.

406
00:23:27.948 --> 00:23:32.328
"No matter how fast you run.
life is about the journey."

407
00:23:34.121 --> 00:23:37.416
Bart. we are going to make this right.

408
00:23:38.667 --> 00:23:41.420
It just takes time
to think things through.

409
00:23:54.892 --> 00:23:56.477
Thank you for the pep talk. sis.

410
00:24:03.359 --> 00:24:06.320
And now I'm thinking.
to get out of this...

411
00:24:08.238 --> 00:24:09.907
we're gonna need an expert
in time travel.

412
00:24:10.866 --> 00:24:12.117
And I know just where to go.

413
00:24:16.455 --> 00:24:18.707
The rain
has not discouraged anyone

414
00:24:18.791 --> 00:24:19.792
from partying in the New Year.

415
00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:23.003
After the bizarre events of 2013--

416
00:24:33.055 --> 00:24:35.265
How did you get in here?

417
00:24:35.349 --> 00:24:39.770
This place has a $12 million
security system and armed guards.

418
00:24:39.853 --> 00:24:42.356
Hi. again.
Sorry to barge in on you like this.

419
00:24:42.439 --> 00:24:43.482
We actually need your help.

420
00:24:43.565 --> 00:24:45.484
It's regarding your theory
on temporal development.

421
00:24:45.567 --> 00:24:47.027
Holy crap!

422
00:24:47.111 --> 00:24:50.864
That. that. that whole getting coffee
while bumping into me in line.

423
00:24:51.115 --> 00:24:52.032
that wasn't an accident.

424
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:56.036
It's classic espionage trick.
You were following me.

425
00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:57.079
Ha ha!

426
00:24:57.204 --> 00:25:00.916
And now you want to take me hostage
and steal all of Fast Track Lab's

427
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.920
corporate secrets. Well. do your worst.
âcause I'm not talking.

428
00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.423
No. Avery. we're not going to hurt you.

429
00:25:08.257 --> 00:25:10.050
We need your help to stop a crime.

430
00:25:10.634 --> 00:25:12.469
Right. Why should I believe you?

431
00:25:12.553 --> 00:25:13.679
Because we're time travelers
from the future

432
00:25:13.762 --> 00:25:14.972
and we need you to show us
how your temporal theory

433
00:25:15.055 --> 00:25:17.474
can help save people at a casino robbery
without actually changing the timeline.

434
00:25:17.558 --> 00:25:18.559
Wow. that felt so good.

435
00:25:19.768 --> 00:25:22.730
-I'm calling security.
-No. wait! We can prove it.

436
00:25:22.813 --> 00:25:25.399
I could show you something
about your past or your future.

437
00:25:25.482 --> 00:25:26.900
But if you show her something
from the future.

438
00:25:26.984 --> 00:25:29.153
she's going to have to wait until
it happens to actually prove anything.

439
00:25:29.445 --> 00:25:32.781
Is that gauntlet using
integrated quantum circuitry?

440
00:25:33.407 --> 00:25:34.783
-Yes.
-Last I checked. yeah.

441
00:25:37.453 --> 00:25:38.912
Liquid processing unit.

442
00:25:39.413 --> 00:25:40.956
Al nano cells.

443
00:25:41.749 --> 00:25:43.792
This is decades away.

444
00:25:48.338 --> 00:25:49.715
You guys are from the future.

445
00:25:50.257 --> 00:25:53.177
We are. Which is why we need your help.

446
00:25:53.635 --> 00:25:56.972
Ever since we arrived.
we've caused serious temporal shifts.

447
00:25:57.473 --> 00:25:58.557
And now...

448
00:26:00.184 --> 00:26:01.560
Thirty people are going to die.

449
00:26:02.352 --> 00:26:04.146
It might be worse than you think.

450
00:26:04.354 --> 00:26:06.565
The death toll keeps changing.
but the headline doesn't.

451
00:26:06.732 --> 00:26:11.278
Because now it's solidified
into a fixed point in time...

452
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.406
Excuse me. Sorry. sorry. sorry.

453
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:20.120
...and that means that the heist
and the deaths aren't causally entangled

454
00:26:20.204 --> 00:26:22.247
like the tachyon particle exchange
in my theory.

455
00:26:22.915 --> 00:26:24.374
Which is looking more like fact.

456
00:26:27.711 --> 00:26:29.963
It's too late to stop the casino heist.

457
00:26:30.047 --> 00:26:33.425
But since the casualties keep changing.
they're not fixed in time.

458
00:26:33.842 --> 00:26:37.012
So you can fix the timeline
and save all those people.

459
00:26:37.638 --> 00:26:40.140
As long as you let
the heist still happen.

460
00:26:40.891 --> 00:26:41.725
Wow.

461
00:26:42.267 --> 00:26:44.103
-Okay. Thanks. Avery.
-Hold on.

462
00:26:44.186 --> 00:26:45.437
I'm coming with you.

463
00:26:45.521 --> 00:26:48.398
Avery. we can't risk you getting hurt.

464
00:26:50.567 --> 00:26:51.568
But we will come back.

465
00:26:53.112 --> 00:26:54.113
I promise you.

466
00:27:19.346 --> 00:27:21.890
Ladies and gents!

467
00:27:23.976 --> 00:27:27.271
I say it's high time we rang in
the New Year...

468
00:27:27.396 --> 00:27:29.064
...with a bang.

469
00:27:43.162 --> 00:27:45.080
Well. here's the drill. folks.

470
00:27:45.539 --> 00:27:49.042
If you run. call for help or annoy us.

471
00:27:49.126 --> 00:27:52.671
my... ooh. king...

472
00:27:53.005 --> 00:27:55.632
will pop your skulls
with his bare hands.

473
00:27:56.675 --> 00:27:58.510
So. please don't make him kill you.

474
00:27:59.595 --> 00:28:00.679
Find the casino vault.

475
00:28:01.597 --> 00:28:03.473
-Empty it.
-Done and doner.

476
00:28:03.557 --> 00:28:04.975
And if we run into trouble?

477
00:28:05.058 --> 00:28:06.518
Show them a winning hand.

478
00:28:15.903 --> 00:28:19.615
Okay. Remember. you need to get
everyone to safety while I find the bomb

479
00:28:19.698 --> 00:28:22.701
-and make sure--
-Let the heist happen.

480
00:28:22.784 --> 00:28:23.660
Yeah.

481
00:28:24.286 --> 00:28:26.205
Stay calm. Bart. You got this.

482
00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:28.749
We got this.

483
00:28:43.805 --> 00:28:46.558
Four minutes to midnight.

484
00:28:53.023 --> 00:28:56.652
My queen. a couple was sitting
right there being quiet.

485
00:28:56.735 --> 00:28:58.487
so I turned my back on them
for a minute.

486
00:28:59.029 --> 00:29:00.197
Now they're missing.

487
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.826
Someone is inside here with us.

488
00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:16.296
Whoever you are. show yourself.

489
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.383
Or my king starts popping heads.

490
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:24.388
Bart. I can't find the bomb.

491
00:29:24.721 --> 00:29:26.139
The Queen is going to start
killing people

492
00:29:26.223 --> 00:29:27.808
unless I do something right now.

493
00:29:28.934 --> 00:29:31.770
What? No. no.
You have to get everyone to safety.

494
00:29:31.853 --> 00:29:33.105
No. time for plan B.

495
00:29:34.022 --> 00:29:35.857
Just get the bomb before midnight.

496
00:29:36.024 --> 00:29:37.943
There is no plan B.

497
00:29:38.527 --> 00:29:39.444
Bart!

498
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.904
Bart!

499
00:29:44.574 --> 00:29:46.410
Last chance.

500
00:29:50.497 --> 00:29:51.540
Wait! Wait!

501
00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:53.625
Whoa. whoa. whoa. Wait. Okay.

502
00:29:53.709 --> 00:29:56.128
Let's all just... Let's just relax.

503
00:29:56.253 --> 00:29:58.088
Okay? No need to lose our heads.

504
00:30:00.507 --> 00:30:03.677
I am the casino manager. obviously.

505
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.180
Isaac is my name and you caught me.

506
00:30:07.848 --> 00:30:10.100
I am the one that was helping
the customers escape.

507
00:30:10.183 --> 00:30:13.103
But I am not doing that anymore.
I'm not going to do that anymore.

508
00:30:13.437 --> 00:30:14.271
Um...

509
00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:18.900
However. since dead people
aren't great for business.

510
00:30:18.984 --> 00:30:21.445
how about I just look away?

511
00:30:21.611 --> 00:30:24.489
You guys just take the money and leave.

512
00:30:24.781 --> 00:30:25.699
Too late.

513
00:30:27.117 --> 00:30:32.372
Tell me. what kind of casino manager
risks his neck on minimum wage?

514
00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:35.667
One who's a really great employee.

515
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:39.421
Oh. Or you're a cop. Hmm?

516
00:30:40.881 --> 00:30:43.633
Let's see what's inside
that beautiful mind of yours.

517
00:30:46.887 --> 00:30:47.971
No. no. no. no.

518
00:30:48.055 --> 00:30:49.806
We've gotta fix this timeline.
to get back to this timeline... Future.

519
00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:52.768
Wait. You're from the future?

520
00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:58.190
She's so cute.

521
00:30:58.732 --> 00:31:00.192
Please let her not have a boyfriend.

522
00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:03.862
Avery. you're my future. My future.

523
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.282
Oh!

524
00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:09.034
That future.

525
00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:12.662
Yeah. well... Love is grand.

526
00:31:14.164 --> 00:31:16.375
Fine. Sit down.

527
00:31:23.507 --> 00:31:28.345
Success. Mona. I mean. my queen.

528
00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:31.056
Ten million dollars' worth. too.

529
00:31:31.181 --> 00:31:32.391
Well. then we're done here.

530
00:31:34.309 --> 00:31:35.227
Wait!

531
00:31:36.436 --> 00:31:38.897
My king. my dear. drop the cop.

532
00:31:39.689 --> 00:31:41.149
Drop the... Hey. wait!

533
00:31:45.487 --> 00:31:46.405
Oh.

534
00:31:47.697 --> 00:31:49.866
If you want to survive. don't follow us.

535
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.201
Just sit down. Stay put.

536
00:31:51.284 --> 00:31:53.120
Enjoy the fireworks. All of them.

537
00:31:53.453 --> 00:31:54.621
All of them.

538
00:32:00.001 --> 00:32:02.671
Sis. the RFG's MIA.

539
00:32:04.423 --> 00:32:05.424
What's up with the bomb search?

540
00:32:08.218 --> 00:32:09.219
It's almost midnight.

541
00:32:11.263 --> 00:32:13.223
Bart. I found the bomb.

542
00:32:13.557 --> 00:32:15.100
It's counting down to midnight.

543
00:32:16.017 --> 00:32:18.478
But one thermal charge
couldn't level this whole building.

544
00:32:18.562 --> 00:32:21.565
Before she left. the queen said.
"Enjoy the fireworks. all of them."

545
00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:23.358
Schrap.

546
00:32:23.733 --> 00:32:25.235
There's more than one bomb.

547
00:32:25.527 --> 00:32:27.028
We only have. like. 30 seconds.

548
00:32:27.112 --> 00:32:28.697
Well. King knocked the hell out of me
and broke my arm.

549
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.490
I'm gonna need three minutes
to speed heal.

550
00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:31.658
I can't get everyone out in time.

551
00:32:31.783 --> 00:32:33.285
But we don't even have one minute.

552
00:32:34.995 --> 00:32:36.788
It's okay. sis. you've got this.

553
00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:37.998
You can find the rest of them.

554
00:32:38.165 --> 00:32:40.083
But it took me forever to find this one.

555
00:32:40.167 --> 00:32:41.918
Sis. you got this.

556
00:32:42.961 --> 00:32:44.629
Think. think. think. think.

557
00:32:46.548 --> 00:32:48.341
The heat signatures in the water tanks.

558
00:32:48.425 --> 00:32:51.094
They must be masking
the bomb's thermal signature.

559
00:32:51.178 --> 00:32:53.889
There it is. Intels are your thing.
sis. get excessive.

560
00:33:01.313 --> 00:33:02.397
Sis. it's almost midnight.

561
00:33:02.522 --> 00:33:04.107
I know. I got them.

562
00:33:04.441 --> 00:33:05.525
There were five.

563
00:33:05.609 --> 00:33:07.277
You've got 15 seconds
to get rid of them.

564
00:33:07.569 --> 00:33:09.112
- Where?
- Anywhere.

565
00:33:09.779 --> 00:33:15.160
Ten. nine. eight. seven. six.

566
00:33:15.911 --> 00:33:18.205
five. four...

567
00:33:19.498 --> 00:33:24.503
three. two. one.

568
00:33:42.812 --> 00:33:45.732
Great job. sis. You did it.

569
00:33:47.234 --> 00:33:48.401
We both did it.

570
00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:10.465
Every witness to the casino robbery
says someone streaked them outside.

571
00:34:11.424 --> 00:34:12.509
What do you think?

572
00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:14.844
Too much champagne?

573
00:34:14.928 --> 00:34:16.012
It beats the hell out of me.

574
00:34:16.096 --> 00:34:17.722
But it looks like we're here
for a long night.

575
00:34:18.974 --> 00:34:21.518
Well. a few Jitters goodies might help.

576
00:34:21.601 --> 00:34:24.854
-Oh! Thank you. baby girl.
-Yeah.

577
00:34:25.105 --> 00:34:28.191
Here's to 2014 not being so weird.

578
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:30.110
Not being so weird.

579
00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:37.951
Hey. uh. you saved my dissertation.
right? Detective Pretty Boy?

580
00:34:40.412 --> 00:34:41.288
Sorry.

581
00:34:42.289 --> 00:34:44.291
That's just what my dad calls you.

582
00:34:46.501 --> 00:34:47.627
Although. I mean. he's not wrong.

583
00:34:47.711 --> 00:34:53.925
You are a boy and you are pretty.
And. uh. that did not come out right.

584
00:34:55.468 --> 00:34:59.014
I'll take any compliment I can get
from Joe West.

585
00:35:00.932 --> 00:35:02.892
Or his lovely daughter.

586
00:35:05.395 --> 00:35:06.813
Yeah. Um...

587
00:35:06.896 --> 00:35:08.940
Well. do you have a name. Detective?

588
00:35:10.191 --> 00:35:11.026
It's Eddie.

589
00:35:18.491 --> 00:35:19.367
Okay.

590
00:35:23.747 --> 00:35:27.626
Counselor Horton. you don't have
anywhere more fun to be tonight?

591
00:35:28.084 --> 00:35:33.548
Uh. yeah. I had to get an evidentiary
disclosure over to Judge Hankerson.

592
00:35:34.591 --> 00:35:40.263
Um. so. look. about this morning.

593
00:35:41.306 --> 00:35:44.559
I'm so sorry if I came off
a little harsh.

594
00:35:45.268 --> 00:35:46.686
See. it turns out that being a lawyer

595
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:49.147
does not make getting divorced
any easier.

596
00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:50.857
It's okay.

597
00:35:52.233 --> 00:35:56.321
I know that splitting up
can be hard. Trust me.

598
00:35:56.821 --> 00:36:00.909
Yeah. So when we bumped
into each other this morning.

599
00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:04.788
I know that you were about to
ask me something.

600
00:36:05.705 --> 00:36:10.377
But I'm not ready.

601
00:36:11.294 --> 00:36:14.506
And I'm not going to be.
not for a while.

602
00:36:16.132 --> 00:36:18.176
Of course. I understand.

603
00:36:19.177 --> 00:36:20.095
Yup.

604
00:36:21.221 --> 00:36:25.183
However. when I am ready.

605
00:36:27.102 --> 00:36:29.604
whoever sent lilacs
to my office tonight.

606
00:36:31.272 --> 00:36:32.107
ooh...

607
00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:35.402
he'll be the first one to know.

608
00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:45.078
Okay. so we stopped the shooting.

609
00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:49.374
We fixed the timeline. and we fixed the
mistakes we made fixing the timeline.

610
00:36:49.457 --> 00:36:50.417
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

611
00:36:50.583 --> 00:36:51.751
Time to head back home.

612
00:36:52.043 --> 00:36:53.753
Interns. you getting in on this?

613
00:36:55.797 --> 00:36:56.881
All right. everybody. line up.

614
00:36:58.049 --> 00:37:00.176
Tall guys in the back.

615
00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.261
Joe. you get in the front.

616
00:37:03.179 --> 00:37:04.264
Happy New Year.

617
00:37:04.347 --> 00:37:05.473
Nope. Mm-mmm.

618
00:37:08.685 --> 00:37:10.270
Okay. just one photo.

619
00:37:10.854 --> 00:37:12.147
Okay. smile everyone.

620
00:37:24.826 --> 00:37:27.120
-I'm really glad you came back.
-Me. too.

621
00:37:28.496 --> 00:37:32.459
Seriously. You haven't
just changed my research.

622
00:37:34.753 --> 00:37:35.879
You changed my life.

623
00:37:36.463 --> 00:37:38.840
Well. I always keep my promises.

624
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:41.926
I had to. You...

625
00:37:42.719 --> 00:37:45.847
You helped save the day with
all your science bad-assery. I mean...

626
00:37:46.848 --> 00:37:50.393
Which is why I...

627
00:37:52.479 --> 00:37:58.234
Look. Avery.
before I go back to my time.

628
00:38:00.236 --> 00:38:03.656
I know we just met.
but it's New Year's Eve. right?

629
00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.074
And I just think that...

630
00:38:22.967 --> 00:38:23.885
Bart!

631
00:38:24.344 --> 00:38:25.929
Bart. It's been two minutes.

632
00:38:26.346 --> 00:38:27.722
Come on. We really have to go.

633
00:38:30.558 --> 00:38:32.352
See you again sometime. McFly?

634
00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:37.565
I promise.

635
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:41.945
All right.

636
00:38:42.153 --> 00:38:43.029
Here we go.

637
00:39:07.512 --> 00:39:11.474
Wait. So I was dead? Killed by Godspeed?

638
00:39:11.641 --> 00:39:14.644
Uncle Jay. I'm so sorry
for screwing up the timeline.

639
00:39:16.312 --> 00:39:18.898
And if that means
I can't ever be The Flash...

640
00:39:21.442 --> 00:39:22.443
I understand.

641
00:39:25.947 --> 00:39:28.199
I'm sorry. Are you kidding me?

642
00:39:28.491 --> 00:39:30.827
If screwing up the timeline
was a deal breaker.

643
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:32.787
your dad couldn't be The Flash.

644
00:39:33.663 --> 00:39:35.415
Heck. when I first started
to time travel.

645
00:39:35.498 --> 00:39:38.543
I ended up fighting Nazis
in World War Il.

646
00:39:38.751 --> 00:39:43.006
And then lived on and off
in the past for 16 years.

647
00:39:44.883 --> 00:39:46.301
But that was another lifetime.

648
00:39:47.302 --> 00:39:49.888
So. you're not mad?

649
00:39:51.431 --> 00:39:52.473
I'm alive.

650
00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:54.684
Right? My Joan is back.

651
00:39:54.767 --> 00:39:56.519
Why would I be mad?

652
00:39:57.186 --> 00:40:00.106
Bart. you're on a journey.

653
00:40:01.441 --> 00:40:02.275
Both of you.

654
00:40:03.568 --> 00:40:09.032
You're going to make mistakes.
and sometimes. they can't be undone.

655
00:40:10.909 --> 00:40:15.246
But you can always try
to make things better.

656
00:40:16.205 --> 00:40:17.040
Right?

657
00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:20.293
And that's what you did today.

658
00:40:24.505 --> 00:40:26.758
Now. I got to get out of here.

659
00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.427
I've got an important meeting
with President Luthor.

660
00:40:30.803 --> 00:40:32.305
-President Luthor?
-President Luthor?

661
00:40:33.306 --> 00:40:34.349
Gotcha.

662
00:40:36.225 --> 00:40:38.019
Oh!

663
00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:46.736
Iris!

664
00:40:46.986 --> 00:40:48.029
Come on!

665
00:40:48.613 --> 00:40:50.823
This brunch reservation
ain't gonna get any later.

666
00:40:50.907 --> 00:40:52.575
Joe. don't worry.
I'll make sure we're on time.

667
00:40:53.576 --> 00:40:55.995
After surviving Armageddon.
we all deserve this.

668
00:40:56.079 --> 00:40:59.123
Hey. you guys got
any resolutions for 20227?

669
00:41:00.291 --> 00:41:04.253
I decided to forgive Mark
for all of his crime things.

670
00:41:05.046 --> 00:41:07.215
What? He's turned over a new leaf

671
00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:09.342
and I made him swear
to stay on the straight and narrow.

672
00:41:10.718 --> 00:41:12.845
Anybody know anything
about Caity's new boyfriend?

673
00:41:13.012 --> 00:41:15.098
Marcus? Anybody met him?

674
00:41:15.348 --> 00:41:17.934
-No.
-No. I hear he's really cute. though.

675
00:41:18.017 --> 00:41:20.687
I have a resolution. actually.
party less.

676
00:41:22.939 --> 00:41:23.856
I know mine.

677
00:41:25.233 --> 00:41:26.150
More family time.

678
00:41:26.818 --> 00:41:28.319
That sounds like a perfect year.

679
00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:30.655
All right. people. let's hurry it up.

680
00:41:30.738 --> 00:41:32.407
Look at the face. Joe's getting hangry.

681
00:41:32.573 --> 00:41:34.033
Okay. everybody. hold hands.

682
00:41:34.117 --> 00:41:35.034
Bundle up.

683
00:41:36.244 --> 00:41:38.496
It's chilly in Paris.

684
00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:46.520
