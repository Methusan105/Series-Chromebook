ï»¿1
00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:16.934
I thought we had a truce.

2
00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.354
I thought as much.

3
00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:23.732
Your bravery strengthened
by the reassurance you gain

4
00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:24.983
from enhanced healing.

5
00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:27.152
Oh. it doesn't mean it hurts any less.

6
00:00:27.653 --> 00:00:31.865
Pain is the debt we pay for change.
and I'm here to change the future.

7
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.159
Thanks to this experiment.

8
00:00:34.243 --> 00:00:37.412
I now know the force required
to kill you when the time comes.

9
00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:38.539
Oh.

10
00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:40.832
I've seen your destiny. Flash.

11
00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:45.128
I've watched you use your power
to destroy everything and everyone.

12
00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.466
You still haven't told me
why I would do this. Huh?

13
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.137
What would cause me to turn my back
on everything I've sworn to protect?

14
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.973
Madness.

15
00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.352
Many times in the past.

16
00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.729
the pain you suffered
nearly crushed you.

17
00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:05.649
But soon. a new despair will befall you

18
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.237
and it will create
an unbroken chain of sorrow so great.

19
00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:13.156
your mind will crack.

20
00:01:14.992 --> 00:01:16.410
And with it. the world ends.

21
00:01:18.704 --> 00:01:22.708
You see. your power
has recently accelerated.

22
00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:26.712
but so too has your ability
to descend into madness.

23
00:01:27.838 --> 00:01:29.840
Tragedy is coming for you. Flash.

24
00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:34.011
What remains to be seen
isn't whether or not you break.

25
00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.137
it's when.

26
00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:36.972
I have seven days.

27
00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:40.392
I'd worry more about tomorrow.
if I were you.

28
00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.936
I don't know the details
of what will happen.

29
00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:46.106
but I know tomorrow
is the beginning of the end.

30
00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:48.150
Your end.

31
00:01:49.568 --> 00:01:52.195
I've granted you a chance
to defy destiny.

32
00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:55.157
But I'll be staying close by.

33
00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:59.703
As soon as I sense
your mind turning mad.

34
00:02:01.163 --> 00:02:02.289
I'll find you.

35
00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:07.252
Good luck fighting fate. Flash.

36
00:02:13.592 --> 00:02:14.760
I'll be watching.

37
00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:16.345
I'll be watching.

38
00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:17.721
I'll be watching.

39
00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:19.890
I'll be watching.

40
00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:50.128
Okay. Uplink to the Tower
mainframe is secure.

41
00:02:50.212 --> 00:02:52.381
You now have access
to our alien database...

42
00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:55.217
...Including any intel
we have on this Despero.

43
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.760
We appreciate you helping. Alex.

44
00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.553
How long will it take to download?

45
00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:00.347
Well. this new algorithm
works at light speed.

46
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.598
In fact. Caitlin.

47
00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:03.767
that guy. Marcus.
that I connected you with.

48
00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:05.268
he designed it.

49
00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:08.230
If the world's still here in a week.
I'll be sure and give him a call.

50
00:03:08.647 --> 00:03:12.651
Oh. I'm sorry. guys. I'll keep digging
and see what I can find out.

51
00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:16.154
But if this Despero
has managed to stay off of our grid.

52
00:03:16.238 --> 00:03:19.491
then he is a greater threat
than any alien we faced.

53
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:20.909
Keep your guard up.

54
00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:24.705
Well. you heard her.
We have to protect Barry.

55
00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:26.832
There's no way
he would destroy the world.

56
00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:28.083
What if he's right?

57
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:30.544
I mean. look. we all saw

58
00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:32.587
how a massive boost of speed
affected Barry before.

59
00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:35.507
Oh. crap. You're right.
Remember the ASF?

60
00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:38.844
He gained speed thinking
but as a result...

61
00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.178
I turned on the people I love.

62
00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:45.559
Look. uh...
that's not gonna happen this time.

63
00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:49.521
But. Barry. what if you
just leveled up too much. too fast?

64
00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:51.523
Barry isn't a threat to us.

65
00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:54.359
Despero is and his story doesn't add up.

66
00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:56.528
I mean. come on.
Doesn't anyone else think it's weird

67
00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:59.072
that an alien cares so much about Earth?

68
00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:00.615
He's not even from here.

69
00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.076
Wherever he's from. here's what we know.

70
00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:06.705
I ran a bio scan on Despero
the minute he entered S.T.A.R. Labs.

71
00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:09.332
His anatomy is unlike anything
I've ever studied before.

72
00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:13.086
He has strength and invulnerability
that rivals Kryptonians.

73
00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:16.298
How are we gonna stop him
from killing you?

74
00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:17.340
Prove him wrong.

75
00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:20.761
Despero says tomorrow.
my mind starts to break.

76
00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:24.389
So all we have to do
is make it through the next 24 hours

77
00:04:24.473 --> 00:04:27.225
without that happening.
and he'll have to back down.

78
00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:28.810
I like that plan.

79
00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:30.645
Let's get some rest.

80
00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:33.315
Tomorrow. we'll need
to be on the lookout for anything.

81
00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:37.861
And if something does happen.
then we need to be ready to stop it.

82
00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:40.864
Protecting this city
is still our top priority.

83
00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:42.282
Even from you?

84
00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:48.288
It won't come to that. I promise.

85
00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:53.335
These are the bio scans
Caity did on Despero's brain.

86
00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:55.629
Study them and let's
figure out a way to stop him.

87
00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:56.588
Oh. I heard that.

88
00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:58.840
I was already planning
on pulling an all-nighter.

89
00:04:58.924 --> 00:04:59.966
You know. I was thinking maybe

90
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.427
we can find a way to restrain him or...

91
00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:05.180
I'm not talking about restraining him.

92
00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.310
Look. we need to level up our offense.

93
00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.354
And I'm not talking about
some containment unit

94
00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:16.399
like we did with Bloodwork
or taking out his lair with an EMP.

95
00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:20.153
We need to hit him hard.

96
00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:24.658
You're... You're asking me
to build a weapon.

97
00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:30.539
Frost. I've never built something
to hurt someone before.

98
00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:35.126
Think of it this way.

99
00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:38.547
You're gonna help save Barry's life
whatever it takes.

100
00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:58.024
Couldn't sleep. either?

101
00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:01.736
Something bad
is supposed to happen today.

102
00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:04.072
All I keep thinking about is you.

103
00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:05.407
I'll be fine.

104
00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:07.784
We can't take any chances.

105
00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:11.955
I promise I have a very safe
and boring day planned.

106
00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:14.875
Cecile's working on a big case.

107
00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.627
So. after some work. I'm gonna
stop by and help her with Jenna.

108
00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:21.214
They both have been having
a pretty hard time lately.

109
00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:25.802
Iris. if anything happens to you--

110
00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:28.471
Hey. baby. we're gonna be okay.

111
00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.893
Look. how many times
in how many timelines

112
00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:34.269
have we found each other?

113
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.147
Doesn't matter what
anybody says about your fate.

114
00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:40.817
Our destiny is to be together.

115
00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:57.584
C.C.P.D.

116
00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:04.299
Allen. just in time.

117
00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:05.508
How bad is it?

118
00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:08.970
Just your typical "makes no sense"
bank robbery in Central City.

119
00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:11.473
No one's hurt.
but the on-duty security guard

120
00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:14.267
is being hospitalized
for some sort of breakdown.

121
00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:15.936
Wait. Like a mental breakdown?

122
00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:17.771
The witnesses said
the guy lost his mind.

123
00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:19.105
and started babbling nonsense.

124
00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:23.944
Then he fired his weapon into the air
and everyone ran out.

125
00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:26.404
By the time anyone got back inside.

126
00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:28.949
the vault was empty
and the guard was stark raving mad.

127
00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:31.076
It took four officers to restrain him.

128
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:32.911
I'm on it.

129
00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:36.706
Allen. I need you to stand down.

130
00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:39.793
What. is Gibson working the case?
I'll... I'll just help him investigate.

131
00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:42.295
I need you to turn in your badge.
You've been suspended.

132
00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:46.216
-What?
-I just came from the mayor's office.

133
00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:49.219
You're under investigation
for federal crimes.

134
00:07:51.972 --> 00:07:53.682
Your badge. Allen. now.

135
00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:17.872
You're
under investigation for federal crimes.

136
00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:19.582
Your badge. Allen.

137
00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:41.187
Allen. I know this must be a shock.

138
00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:43.732
Captain. hold on.
What... What am I supposed to have done?

139
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.568
Two years ago. Joseph Carver

140
00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:48.987
had a mole
manipulating evidence at C.C.P.D.

141
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.656
Yeah. Millie Rawlins aka Sunshine.
We caught her.

142
00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:59.497
And the DA was reviewing her case
as a part of an internal audit.

143
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:03.043
Now. I don't know what exactly.
but he also found new evidence

144
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:06.921
that points to Carver
having a second inside man. You.

145
00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:12.010
That's crazy.

146
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.845
I mean. why would I help Joseph Carver?

147
00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:15.472
That's for the DA to suss out.

148
00:09:16.347 --> 00:09:19.559
I'm sorry. It's above my pay grade.
Now please leave the scene.

149
00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:21.436
I have to find out what happened here.

150
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.272
I mean. I think you'd have
other concerns right now.

151
00:09:24.355 --> 00:09:25.190
I just...

152
00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:27.233
Korber said a guard lost his mind.

153
00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:29.360
What if that happens to somebody else?

154
00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:30.278
People could get hurt.

155
00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.865
Look. Captain.
I know you only have my word.

156
00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:36.576
but you got to believe me. I'm innocent.

157
00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:39.245
So. please. just let me do my job.

158
00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:42.582
If Joe were here right now.

159
00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:45.251
he'd say I should learn
from last year and keep an open mind.

160
00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:51.549
Which is why I promise you.
I will get to the bottom of this

161
00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:52.801
and find out the truth.

162
00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:57.013
But until I do. I'm sorry. Allen.
you have to leave.

163
00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:07.565
This is insane.
Your C.C.P.D. record is stellar.

164
00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:10.068
Everyone knows that Rawlins
was nothing but Carver's lackey.

165
00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:12.278
Can you find out what evidence
they have against me?

166
00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:14.614
Oh. Barry. I'm gonna do
a hell a lot more than that.

167
00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:16.282
I am about to slap C.C.P.D.

168
00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:19.160
with the biggest wrongful termination
lawsuit this city has ever seen.

169
00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:22.163
I am gonna bleed them dry
for doing this to you.

170
00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:24.958
Are you feeling all right?

171
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.046
No.

172
00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:37.804
I'm sorry. It's just been hard lately.

173
00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:41.182
I mean. you know why.

174
00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:50.608
What's wrong?

175
00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:53.820
We're not alone in here.

176
00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:58.449
I can feel another presence
in this room.

177
00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:07.667
Why are you here?

178
00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:08.835
I'm not.

179
00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:12.422
This is a psychic manifestation
of my consciousness.

180
00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:14.382
Appearing only to you

181
00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:17.594
in order to assess
your mental stability.

182
00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:21.514
Barry. who are you talking to?

183
00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:27.937
There's nothing wrong with my mind.

184
00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:31.065
That's him. isn't it? Despero?

185
00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:34.235
Your mind is suffering
due to this tragedy.

186
00:11:35.486 --> 00:11:36.321
But. no.

187
00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:38.573
it hasn't broken...

188
00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:41.784
yet.

189
00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:52.545
His energy...
his energy. it felt like...

190
00:11:54.672 --> 00:11:58.218
the whole room was flooded
and we were both drowning.

191
00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.678
Well. Despero's watching me now.

192
00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:03.264
waiting for the proof
he needs to kill me.

193
00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:06.267
Are you sure he is not
what drives you insane?

194
00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:08.144
No. I'm not.

195
00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:12.732
But I do think there's another
explanation for what's happening.

196
00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:17.320
Korber said a security guard
at this morning's robbery lost his mind.

197
00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:19.239
That can't be a coincidence. Not today.

198
00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:20.740
No. It has to be connected

199
00:12:20.823 --> 00:12:22.951
to what Despero said
happens in the future.

200
00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:25.036
I need to talk to that guard.

201
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.060
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

202

Xotar.

207
00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:22.135
Caitlin. hey. good timing.
I think I've got a clue

208
00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:24.095
to run through the S.T.A.R. Labs
search satellites.

209
00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:26.306
Barry. we need you here right now.

210
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:28.683
The city is shutting down S.T.A.R. Labs.

211
00:13:28.766 --> 00:13:32.937
Okay. lock this place down.
I want that radiation leak found.

212
00:13:33.187 --> 00:13:34.689
Get here fast.

213
00:13:36.357 --> 00:13:37.317
Xotar.

214
00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:43.281
Xotar. Xotar. Xotar.

215
00:13:51.122 --> 00:13:54.250
You can't just come in here
and kick us out of our own offices.

216
00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:56.627
Public Safety Act?

217
00:13:56.753 --> 00:13:57.795
Passed four years ago

218
00:13:57.879 --> 00:14:00.006
after the meta fallout
nearly took out the city.

219
00:14:00.214 --> 00:14:02.759
Means we can do whatever
we have to do for the greater good.

220
00:14:02.925 --> 00:14:04.594
Post teams at every entrance.

221
00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:06.971
- No one gets in without clearance.
- Right away.

222
00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:09.474
Excuse me. I'm Barry Allen.

223
00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:10.850
I own this facility.

224
00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:13.353
Mr. Allen. we've detected
dangerous levels

225
00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:15.646
of radiation within your facility.

226
00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:18.441
This lab's a day away from a meltdown.

227
00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:19.567
That's impossible.

228
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.611
We would have noticed
if things were that bad.

229
00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:23.112
Uh. maybe not.

230
00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:25.239
I just checked out the safety logs.

231
00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:28.076
Our radiation scanners
haven't updated in over a week.

232
00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:30.953
It doesn't make any sense.

233
00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:35.917
What happened?

234
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.794
This is part of our
early detection array

235
00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.962
that monitors radiation levels
inside the place.

236
00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:41.422
But it's corroding.

237
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.383
It hasn't been functioning for a while.

238
00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:46.135
Sensors in the subterranean power core

239
00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:48.554
currently read over a thousand rads.

240
00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:51.307
Consider yourselves lucky.

241
00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:55.144
Another day. you'd all be in ICU.
Seal off that power core.

242
00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:56.062
Yes. sir.

243
00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:57.897
And get an external
containment team. stat.

244
00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.148
What kind of containment?

245
00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.943
We need to construct
a concrete and steel encasement

246
00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:03.486
around this entire facility

247
00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:05.655
in order to contain
the radioactive material.

248
00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:07.198
Then we'll demolish S.T.A.R. Labs

249
00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:09.575
and move the debris
to a nuclear waste site.

250
00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:11.119
You're gonna demolish it?

251
00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:14.747
Safety board makes the final call.
This looks pretty bad.

252
00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:18.418
Now. gather your people and say goodbye.

253
00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:21.504
You got five minutes
to make like a banana and split.

254
00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:24.549
Fan out and search all levels
for additional leaks.

255
00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:26.134
Excuse me.

256
00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:31.431
Okay. This place is already
swarming with city workers.

257
00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:32.849
If they get to the inner levels...

258
00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:34.392
They'll find out it's Flash HQ.

259
00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:36.185
Aka our home base.

260
00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:37.728
That's why I need you to grab
what you're able to.

261
00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:41.274
conceal the lab's critical areas
and get out as fast as you can.

262
00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:54.120
Hello. Barry Allen.

263
00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:57.081
Gideon. can you pull up the controls
for the holographic emitters

264
00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:58.332
and set them to manual?

265
00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.376
Understood. Preparing task.

266
00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:02.253
What do you need. Ches P?

267
00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:11.095
Where are you?

268
00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:13.639
Yes.

269
00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:16.809
Instruction set received.
Holographic emitters reconfigured.

270
00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:17.727
Initiate.

271
00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:26.068
Must be old plans.

272
00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:54.180
All clear.

273
00:16:54.388 --> 00:16:55.306
Okay. let's head back.

274
00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:06.609
Sequence complete.

275
00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:09.570
However. Team Flash data
on internal servers

276
00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:11.906
will compromise your identity
if discovered.

277
00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:14.325
Standing by for emergency data wipe.

278
00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:15.910
Gideon. is there any other way?

279
00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:17.411
No. Barry Allen.

280
00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:19.288
All information within S.T.A.R. Labs

281
00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:21.541
must be erased
in order to assure your safety.

282
00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:23.125
This includes myself.

283
00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:24.961
This is the best option.

284
00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:27.421
I'm so sorry. Gideon.

285
00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:31.133
It has been an honor working
with you. Barry Allen. Farewell.

286
00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:46.148
It has been an honor
working with you. Barry Allen. Farewell.

287
00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:58.202
Frost ice-bridged a bunch of stuff
out of here.

288
00:17:58.286 --> 00:17:59.954
-She's gonna bring it to Caitlin's.
-Okay.

289
00:18:00.037 --> 00:18:00.997
It's time to go.

290
00:18:01.372 --> 00:18:02.873
I can't believe this is happening.

291
00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:06.961
This was our home.

292
00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:15.261
This...

293
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.846
This is so unreal.

294
00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:20.766
I've spent more time in that lab
than anywhere I've ever lived.

295
00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:25.062
Guys. I know how much this hurts.

296
00:18:25.855 --> 00:18:28.316
and I know what you're thinking.

297
00:18:28.691 --> 00:18:30.526
But these setbacks aren't proof

298
00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.194
that Despero's right about the future.

299
00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:34.989
They're not proof he isn't either.

300
00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:37.825
I know. but. I mean.
we gotta have faith.

301
00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:41.120
Not just in me. but in each other.

302
00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:46.876
Barry. we're with you.

303
00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:48.586
I think we all just wished

304
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:51.589
that there was some other explanation
for all this.

305
00:18:52.715 --> 00:18:53.758
I think there is.

306
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.053
Something caused a security guard

307
00:18:57.136 --> 00:19:00.431
to lose his mind
at a bank robbery this morning.

308
00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:04.352
Uh. you mean. exactly like what
Despero said would happen to you?

309
00:19:04.435 --> 00:19:05.895
This has to be related.

310
00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:09.315
I was going to use the S.T.A.R. Labs
satellites to follow a lead.

311
00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:11.567
But luckily. we have someone on our team

312
00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:13.778
who is an expert at exposing the truth.

313
00:19:17.448 --> 00:19:19.659
- The Xotar story is priority one.
- Got it.

314
00:19:22.244 --> 00:19:23.412
Okay. the word's out.

315
00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:26.040
If there's anything
to this "Xotar" lead.

316
00:19:26.123 --> 00:19:27.416
my people will find it.

317
00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:31.212
Despero said I'm gonna
destroy the world.

318
00:19:32.129 --> 00:19:37.968
If that's true. I'm the reason
everyone I love is gonna die.

319
00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:40.179
Barry. do you remember the last time

320
00:19:40.262 --> 00:19:44.392
that something messed with your head
when you had speed thinking?

321
00:19:44.558 --> 00:19:47.687
It was like I was on auto-pilot.
my mind just took over.

322
00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:49.230
Yeah. but you snapped out of it

323
00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:51.649
because you saw
that your friends were in danger.

324
00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:53.943
I mean. you could never really hurt us.

325
00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:57.571
Even so. if something
does happen to someone I love

326
00:19:57.655 --> 00:20:00.616
because of my leveled up speed.

327
00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:03.577
I don't know how I'd react.

328
00:20:07.456 --> 00:20:08.374
It's Taylor.

329
00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:10.710
She found out that "Xotar"

330
00:20:10.793 --> 00:20:12.670
is the name of a meta criminal
in National City.

331
00:20:12.753 --> 00:20:13.629
Xotar's a meta?

332
00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.339
A psychic meta who controls

333
00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:18.342
her victims' minds
and drives them crazy.

334
00:20:18.509 --> 00:20:19.802
You know what this means.

335
00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:22.221
Xotar could be the real reason
I lose my mind today.

336
00:20:22.304 --> 00:20:24.223
And catching her will prevent it.

337
00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:25.850
All I have to do is find her.

338
00:20:31.939 --> 00:20:33.065
Xotar...

339
00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:36.193
Xotar...

340
00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:42.324
Flash. you found me.

341
00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:43.409
Yes.

342
00:20:43.492 --> 00:20:45.119
Let me guess. You're psychic. too.

343
00:20:45.202 --> 00:20:47.163
Not psychic. just patient.

344
00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:48.998
I knew if I ran around the city
long enough.

345
00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:50.249
eventually you'd show yourself.

346
00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:52.918
How very underwhelming and basic of you.

347
00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:56.255
So what's next? We fight?

348
00:20:56.547 --> 00:20:57.465
How passÃ©.

349
00:20:57.715 --> 00:21:00.384
Actually. what do you say we take
a quick trip to Iron Heights?

350
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.230
What the hell
is wrong with you?

351
00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:16.192
What's going on?

352
00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:23.574
You zooped in out of nowhere
and started destroying the place.

353
00:21:23.908 --> 00:21:27.244
-What? No. I--
-You almost lightning-blasted Chuck.

354
00:21:34.835 --> 00:21:36.504
I don't remember doing any of that.

355
00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:54.814
Okay. listen. Hey. I don't know what
just happened. but I didn't do this.

356
00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:56.649
And I'm... I'm not going insane.

357
00:21:56.732 --> 00:21:59.026
-Barry. we saw you.
-No way. I--

358
00:21:59.109 --> 00:22:01.529
Dude. she's right. You came in here
all lathered up out of control.

359
00:22:01.612 --> 00:22:03.989
-Allegra had to blast you. man.
-Okay.

360
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:08.202
All right. look. whatever happened.
I can prove I'm myself now.

361
00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:10.496
Or at least Caitlin can.

362
00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:17.002
Cover me.

363
00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:30.057
Your amygdala activity
and cortisol levels are elevated.

364
00:22:30.766 --> 00:22:33.602
But within normal parameters.

365
00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.070
Even if you're really you again.

366
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.738
it doesn't explain what just happened.

367
00:22:44.822 --> 00:22:46.615
Now I know who's responsible for this.

368
00:22:48.158 --> 00:22:51.787
Right before it happened.
I intercepted a meta called Xotar.

369
00:22:51.871 --> 00:22:53.539
She controls her victims' minds.

370
00:22:53.998 --> 00:22:57.209
What are the odds a meta who commits
telepathic assaults on people

371
00:22:57.293 --> 00:23:00.421
shows up the same day Despero claims
I'm going to lose my mind?

372
00:23:00.504 --> 00:23:02.840
It does make a lot more sense.

373
00:23:02.923 --> 00:23:05.843
Okay. We need to find Xotar
and stop this from happening.

374
00:23:05.926 --> 00:23:08.095
And keep Despero from killing you.

375
00:23:08.178 --> 00:23:11.223
Back at S.T.A.R. Labs. you could scan
for Xotar's energy signature

376
00:23:11.307 --> 00:23:14.935
and find her.
but those satellites are blind.

377
00:23:15.019 --> 00:23:16.228
I can search the city.

378
00:23:16.812 --> 00:23:18.397
I found her once. I can find her again.

379
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:22.860
Frost needs help setting up
a portable med lab at the apartment.

380
00:23:22.943 --> 00:23:26.989
Me and Allegra can set up
a comms/Cortex type sitch in my garage.

381
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.867
All right. do it. And look. guys.

382
00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:34.538
I know today started with a loss.
but we can end it with a win.

383
00:23:35.706 --> 00:23:36.624
We got this.

384
00:23:52.514 --> 00:23:53.557
Sorry.

385
00:23:53.641 --> 00:23:54.683
Sorry. It's all right.

386
00:23:55.184 --> 00:23:57.144
Search for Xotar all you want.

387
00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.940
The answer you're looking for
has been with you all along.

388
00:24:01.231 --> 00:24:02.191
Enough.

389
00:24:02.608 --> 00:24:04.944
No more cryptic prophecies.
No more games.

390
00:24:05.861 --> 00:24:07.112
Why do you care so much?

391
00:24:08.572 --> 00:24:10.324
You said yourself.
this isn't your world.

392
00:24:10.741 --> 00:24:12.076
You're hiding something from me.

393
00:24:14.745 --> 00:24:15.829
What do you have to gain?

394
00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:18.415
A home.

395
00:24:21.085 --> 00:24:23.754
I saw my planet. Kalanor.
overrun by evil.

396
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.632
I was forced to see the people I love

397
00:24:26.715 --> 00:24:28.968
suffer and die
under the fist of a despot.

398
00:24:30.427 --> 00:24:33.681
Then I was chosen to lead
a band of rebels attempting a coup.

399
00:24:36.392 --> 00:24:38.394
Both sides suffered heavy losses.

400
00:24:39.395 --> 00:24:40.771
But we were triumphant.

401
00:24:42.147 --> 00:24:45.109
However. when the time came
to cut the head off the snake...

402
00:24:47.569 --> 00:24:49.697
I chose to spare the oppressor's life.

403
00:24:53.659 --> 00:24:55.536
But my mercy was misguided...

404
00:24:57.287 --> 00:24:59.832
because it allowed
that madman to rise again

405
00:24:59.957 --> 00:25:02.668
and rain down horrors
a thousand times worse.

406
00:25:05.254 --> 00:25:06.463
I was spared...

407
00:25:08.382 --> 00:25:11.135
because he knew for me.
the only fate worse than death

408
00:25:12.052 --> 00:25:13.762
would be losing my home world.

409
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:17.933
So he banished me here.

410
00:25:18.726 --> 00:25:21.395
That's how I came to adopt Earth
as my new home.

411
00:25:21.937 --> 00:25:23.772
only to watch you destroy it.

412
00:25:24.982 --> 00:25:26.900
I've been through a crisis before.

413
00:25:29.153 --> 00:25:30.988
Whatever's coming. I can handle it.

414
00:25:31.739 --> 00:25:34.491
Crisis and tragedy
are like fires. Flash.

415
00:25:35.784 --> 00:25:37.703
Some are strong enough to endure them.

416
00:25:38.495 --> 00:25:40.914
But others are destined
to be consumed by them.

417
00:25:43.083 --> 00:25:44.960
Soon. we'll find out who you are.

418
00:25:56.013 --> 00:25:57.222
Okay.

419
00:25:58.098 --> 00:25:59.767
This is the last of your...

420
00:26:00.309 --> 00:26:01.643
Whatever this stuff is.

421
00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:03.479
What's this thing?

422
00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:05.105
Uh. nothing.

423
00:26:05.564 --> 00:26:11.111
It's just a... a project for Frost.
That's all.

424
00:26:11.737 --> 00:26:12.571
Uh-huh.

425
00:26:13.405 --> 00:26:16.033
Chuck. you know how we've been
spending more time together lately?

426
00:26:16.867 --> 00:26:20.120
Oh. yeah. Our weekend D&D sessions
are like my new favorite thing.

427
00:26:20.204 --> 00:26:21.914
Why?

428
00:26:22.873 --> 00:26:25.918
Well. and I can't believe
I'm saying this.

429
00:26:26.001 --> 00:26:28.712
but the way you just said "nothing."

430
00:26:29.213 --> 00:26:32.716
is exactly how you sounded
right before the raid on Shavak's tomb.

431
00:26:33.467 --> 00:26:35.219
And we all knew
you were bluffing then. too.

432
00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:38.013
Yeah. Okay. Uh...

433
00:26:40.808 --> 00:26:43.143
Frost asked me to build...

434
00:26:45.354 --> 00:26:49.066
a weapon to hurt Despero.

435
00:26:50.359 --> 00:26:51.443
But you're...

436
00:26:51.527 --> 00:26:55.030
A pacifist. Yeah. I know.

437
00:26:56.698 --> 00:26:58.826
How do you feel about doing this?

438
00:26:59.243 --> 00:27:00.160
Allegra.

439
00:27:02.871 --> 00:27:05.290
You know. I still remember
the exact moment

440
00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:07.835
that I decided to be a pacifist.

441
00:27:10.337 --> 00:27:11.672
I was ten.

442
00:27:14.424 --> 00:27:17.344
I had just seen
Marvin the Martian's ray gun

443
00:27:18.137 --> 00:27:19.847
on the Saturday morning cartoons.

444
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.894
So I decided to make one of my own.

445
00:27:29.398 --> 00:27:32.776
When I demoed it for my best friend.

446
00:27:34.153 --> 00:27:38.073
it malfunctioned and...

447
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.495
I burned his parents' house down.

448
00:27:46.957 --> 00:27:48.834
Him and his family
barely made it out alive.

449
00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:55.841
After that. I made a vow.

450
00:27:56.008 --> 00:27:58.719
No more weapons. no matter what.

451
00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:02.973
So. by going back on that vow now.

452
00:28:04.224 --> 00:28:06.977
I feel like by building this.
I'm not just going to hurt Despero.

453
00:28:09.062 --> 00:28:10.439
I'm gonna hurt myself. too.

454
00:28:13.483 --> 00:28:19.573
Look. I know you want to
do right by Barry and by the team.

455
00:28:20.616 --> 00:28:24.036
but you can't do that
if you don't do right by yourself.

456
00:28:25.621 --> 00:28:27.414
It's not your job to make weapons.

457
00:28:27.497 --> 00:28:32.336
It's to find a way to protect Barry

458
00:28:32.836 --> 00:28:35.297
and stay true to yourself.

459
00:28:39.885 --> 00:28:42.596
Yeah. Yeah.

460
00:28:44.473 --> 00:28:45.933
-What's that?
-Uh...

461
00:28:47.017 --> 00:28:48.727
Okay. I built a temporary comms system

462
00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:50.604
by piggybacking off of cell towers.

463
00:28:50.687 --> 00:28:54.983
I'm also using it to scan for C.C.P.D.
chatter about criminal activity.

464
00:28:55.067 --> 00:28:56.109
-Right?
-Right.

465
00:28:57.361 --> 00:28:59.029
Okay. okay. uh...

466
00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:02.282
Flash. we got trouble.

467
00:29:02.908 --> 00:29:05.244
Chester. what's happening?

468
00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:26.848
Miss. step aside.

469
00:29:27.182 --> 00:29:29.476
But if I did that. then how would I grab

470
00:29:29.559 --> 00:29:31.937
all the priceless art
you're transporting?

471
00:29:33.689 --> 00:29:36.108
Officer. you sound insane.

472
00:29:41.905 --> 00:29:46.952
Xotar. Xotar.

473
00:29:47.035 --> 00:29:50.372
Xotar. Xotar.

474
00:29:51.915 --> 00:29:54.251
Central City Museum. you shouldn't have.

475
00:29:54.334 --> 00:29:55.877
It's like you read my mind.

476
00:30:02.884 --> 00:30:04.720
You're done messing with
other people's minds. Xotar.

477
00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:06.013
Including mine.

478
00:30:13.312 --> 00:30:15.397
If it makes you feel
like less of a failure.

479
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.859
I dug my claws into your mind
long before you even arrived.

480
00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:28.827
Apologies for not mentioning
the telekinesis.

481
00:30:29.453 --> 00:30:30.871
Didn't take a crystal ball to know

482
00:30:30.954 --> 00:30:33.332
I'd eventually have to catch you
by surprise.

483
00:30:33.582 --> 00:30:38.795
You know. back in the day.
my specialty was bending spoons.

484
00:30:56.396 --> 00:30:58.482
Okay. uh. guys.
now C.C.P.D. is reporting

485
00:30:58.565 --> 00:31:00.650
that the Flash is getting
his butt kicked downtown

486
00:31:00.734 --> 00:31:03.487
by some meta magician
that's got him suspended in midair.

487
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:05.155
It's got to be Xotar.

488
00:31:05.238 --> 00:31:06.531
Barry. Frost is on her way.

489
00:31:06.615 --> 00:31:09.117
But she's all the way across town.
She'll never make it in time.

490
00:31:09.201 --> 00:31:10.911
No. I can stop Xotar!

491
00:31:10.994 --> 00:31:13.830
I just need to generate
enough lightning.

492
00:31:13.914 --> 00:31:15.582
But. Barry. you need friction

493
00:31:15.665 --> 00:31:17.167
to build up that kind of kinetic energy.

494
00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:21.755
If you can't run.
you can't throw lightning. Barry?

495
00:31:23.423 --> 00:31:24.299
Barry?

496
00:31:38.647 --> 00:31:40.774
It sounds like
Barry is generating lightning.

497
00:31:40.857 --> 00:31:42.025
How is that possible?

498
00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:44.236
Holy Granville T. Woods.

499
00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:48.073
Okay. if he's vibrating his cells
on a microscopic level.

500
00:31:48.782 --> 00:31:51.785
that might be enough movement
to... to build up an electrical charge.

501
00:31:51.868 --> 00:31:53.328
How would he throw lightning then?

502
00:31:53.412 --> 00:31:55.580
I don't think he's going to.

503
00:31:55.872 --> 00:31:59.835
My guess is he's letting it build up
inside of him on purpose.

504
00:32:00.252 --> 00:32:04.047
Caitlin. what happens if his body
can't hold in his lightning anymore?

505
00:32:04.548 --> 00:32:05.966
I think we're about to find out.

506
00:32:47.591 --> 00:32:50.051
That was the hospital.
The guard that Xotar attacked

507
00:32:50.135 --> 00:32:52.262
recovered as soon as
she was meta-cuffed.

508
00:32:52.554 --> 00:32:53.930
So did everyone else she attacked.

509
00:32:54.347 --> 00:32:55.432
How you feeling. Barry?

510
00:32:56.349 --> 00:32:58.351
Like it's barely past lunchtime.

511
00:32:58.435 --> 00:33:00.520
it already feels like
the longest day of my life.

512
00:33:00.604 --> 00:33:02.355
But it also feels like
it's going to be a good one.

513
00:33:02.439 --> 00:33:04.024
Now that we've gotten Xotar.
we don't have to worry about

514
00:33:04.107 --> 00:33:06.610
the rest of the day
or you losing your sanity.

515
00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.071
Well. in that case. I don't know
about you guys. but I'm starving.

516
00:33:10.155 --> 00:33:11.490
Oh. yeah.

517
00:33:11.698 --> 00:33:13.617
Why don't we meet up with Iris
at Joe and Cecile's?

518
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.243
Let's see if we can talk Joe
into whipping us up

519
00:33:15.327 --> 00:33:16.745
a pot of his famous jambalaya?

520
00:33:19.915 --> 00:33:22.667
That's not funny. Barry.

521
00:33:23.168 --> 00:33:25.795
Okay. ask him to grill
some burgers instead.

522
00:33:26.546 --> 00:33:27.797
Why are you doing that?

523
00:33:29.424 --> 00:33:30.425
Doing what?

524
00:33:30.717 --> 00:33:32.511
Acting like Joe's still alive.

525
00:33:38.517 --> 00:33:39.768
What are you talking about?

526
00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:42.103
You don't remember?

527
00:33:45.106 --> 00:33:46.816
Barry. Joe died six months ago.

528
00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:48.902
You know that.

529
00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.196
What?

530
00:33:53.073 --> 00:33:55.617
No. I don't believe you.

531
00:33:57.077 --> 00:33:58.870
Barry. look.

532
00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:04.084
maybe you're still processing this
or something? I don't know.

533
00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:06.545
But we'll... we'll figure it out.

534
00:34:07.295 --> 00:34:09.756
Okay? Why don't you just sit down

535
00:34:10.257 --> 00:34:14.094
and let Caitlin take a look
at the ol' noggin?

536
00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.571
-Where is he?
-Barry. you're scaring me.

537
00:34:32.654 --> 00:34:33.697
-Where is he?
-Who?

538
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.781
Joe!

539
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.755
You gave the eulogy at his funeral.

540
00:34:52.048 --> 00:34:52.966
No. I...

541
00:34:55.176 --> 00:34:57.554
No. this is wrong. Iris. this is wrong.

542
00:34:57.637 --> 00:34:58.513
We have to investigate this.

543
00:34:58.597 --> 00:34:59.848
We have to find out
what really happened to him.

544
00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:01.600
He's not dead. He can't be.

545
00:35:02.058 --> 00:35:03.018
Damn it. Barry.

546
00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.187
Joe is gone.

547
00:35:07.814 --> 00:35:09.566
Why can't you just accept that?

548
00:35:27.792 --> 00:35:28.627
Cecile.

549
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.129
Barry. why are you saying
all these things all of a sudden?

550
00:35:31.212 --> 00:35:32.589
It's like the last six months.

551
00:35:33.048 --> 00:35:35.383
this living nightmare.
never even happened.

552
00:35:35.467 --> 00:35:36.343
Six months.

553
00:35:36.468 --> 00:35:38.845
What are you doing?
I can't do this with you.

554
00:35:38.928 --> 00:35:40.180
Barry. I can't do it.

555
00:35:40.263 --> 00:35:42.474
Cecile. listen to me. Joe's not dead.

556
00:35:42.557 --> 00:35:43.516
Yes.

557
00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:46.144
Yes. he is.

558
00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:50.315
He's dead and I'm trying to move on.

559
00:35:50.482 --> 00:35:52.609
-Why won't you let me do that?
-Cecile. please.

560
00:35:52.692 --> 00:35:53.693
Barry.

561
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.529
You're all over the news.

562
00:35:57.489 --> 00:35:59.449
-What?
-What did you do?

563
00:36:00.075 --> 00:36:01.076
Nothing...

564
00:36:03.745 --> 00:36:06.289
After apprehending
a criminal earlier today.

565
00:36:06.373 --> 00:36:10.418
the Flash. for reasons unknown.
committed a crime of his own.

566
00:36:10.502 --> 00:36:14.005
Warning. This footage
may be disturbing to some viewers.

567
00:36:22.097 --> 00:36:25.433
Our camerawoman was barely able
to escape with her life.

568
00:36:25.517 --> 00:36:27.435
Luckily. there were no deaths today.

569
00:36:27.602 --> 00:36:31.481
despite what city officials estimate
are millions of dollars in damage.

570
00:36:31.564 --> 00:36:32.816
But other members of our crew.

571
00:36:32.899 --> 00:36:35.652
along with dozens of innocent civilians.

572
00:36:35.735 --> 00:36:38.405
were injured
in the Flash's brazen attack.

573
00:36:38.488 --> 00:36:41.116
Once again. our top story.

574
00:36:41.241 --> 00:36:43.993
the hero who has saved our city
countless times

575
00:36:44.077 --> 00:36:45.912
has turned against us.

576
00:36:45.995 --> 00:36:48.915
More on this unprecedented
breaking development.

577
00:36:48.998 --> 00:36:51.167
as we head to our reporter
on the ground.

578
00:36:53.795 --> 00:36:55.004
I don't remember doing that.

579
00:36:55.171 --> 00:36:57.632
Caitlin said you didn't remember
destroying the loft

580
00:36:58.299 --> 00:37:00.260
or almost killing her
and Chester either.

581
00:37:03.096 --> 00:37:05.140
Barry. we can blame Xotar for the loft.

582
00:37:06.266 --> 00:37:08.601
But she was in meta-cuffs
when you destroyed City Hall.

583
00:37:09.561 --> 00:37:10.770
Do you see?

584
00:37:13.481 --> 00:37:15.233
It's been you all along. Flash.

585
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:17.777
-Now do you believe me?
-No.

586
00:37:18.445 --> 00:37:20.238
This is one of your illusions.
That's it.

587
00:37:20.739 --> 00:37:22.157
Iris. Cecile. you have to believe me.

588
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.158
Enough!

589
00:37:23.616 --> 00:37:25.326
This ends now.

590
00:37:32.792 --> 00:37:33.793
Barry!

591
00:37:36.004 --> 00:37:37.630
It's fitting that I end your life

592
00:37:37.714 --> 00:37:40.300
with the undying fire of my home world.

593
00:37:40.383 --> 00:37:42.260
The Flame of Py'tar.

594
00:37:43.928 --> 00:37:45.305
Get out of my house.

595
00:37:54.272 --> 00:37:55.440
The empath.

596
00:37:56.775 --> 00:38:00.069
Well. your power's no match for me.
so for now...

597
00:38:01.237 --> 00:38:02.113
Sleep.

598
00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:08.536
Stop!

599
00:38:08.995 --> 00:38:11.372
If it's me you want. get it over with.

600
00:38:11.456 --> 00:38:12.499
Gladly.

601
00:38:23.802 --> 00:38:25.512
That's all I got. Barry. run.

602
00:38:26.513 --> 00:38:27.555
Good move. Chuck.

603
00:38:28.807 --> 00:38:30.475
What's wrong with you people?

604
00:38:30.558 --> 00:38:33.937
You saw the destruction he'll bring
to the world with your own eyes.

605
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.481
Why am I fighting this threat alone?

606
00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:46.825
Stand in my way again. any of you.
and suffer the consequences.

607
00:38:47.283 --> 00:38:51.204
I will find the Flash and end him...

608
00:38:51.746 --> 00:38:54.415
before he brings about Armageddon.

609
00:39:07.512 --> 00:39:08.930
So is Barry going to be all right?

610
00:39:09.931 --> 00:39:11.391
Honestly. we don't know.

611
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:16.104
Can you tell us anything else about
Despero's planet or his freaky flame?

612
00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:19.440
Well. actually. the pieces
are starting to come together.

613
00:39:19.524 --> 00:39:22.569
For years. we had heard
rumors and whispers

614
00:39:22.652 --> 00:39:26.197
from the dark corners of the galaxy
about the Flame of Py'tar.

615
00:39:26.406 --> 00:39:28.700
which is an energy source
that was supposedly

616
00:39:28.783 --> 00:39:30.702
the sentient heart
of the planet Kalanor.

617
00:39:30.785 --> 00:39:31.995
But just when we started to think

618
00:39:32.078 --> 00:39:34.581
that this was a pan-galactic
urban legend.

619
00:39:34.664 --> 00:39:38.668
you guys are the first to meet
an actual Kalanorian.

620
00:39:40.795 --> 00:39:41.921
Lucky us.

621
00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:43.965
Yeah. but thanks to you guys.

622
00:39:44.048 --> 00:39:46.134
we've opened an official file
on Despero.

623
00:39:46.509 --> 00:39:48.011
Kara and J'onn. they're off-world.

624
00:39:48.094 --> 00:39:50.889
But we'll keep investigating.
and I'll call if we find anything

625
00:39:50.972 --> 00:39:52.265
that can help take him down.

626
00:39:52.974 --> 00:39:54.267
You guys stay safe. okay?

627
00:39:55.143 --> 00:39:56.519
Yeah. Thanks. You too. Alex.

628
00:39:57.979 --> 00:40:00.899
We may not be the Tower
or have access to S.T.A.R. Labs.

629
00:40:00.982 --> 00:40:02.942
but Chester P.
can still roll up his sleeves

630
00:40:03.443 --> 00:40:06.237
and see what I can come up with
to help track down Barry.

631
00:40:06.654 --> 00:40:09.115
Assuming he wants to be found.

632
00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.660
If you and Allegra hadn't shown up
when you did--

633
00:40:12.744 --> 00:40:17.081
Hey. hey. It's all good. Okay?
We'll figure this out. We always do.

634
00:40:18.625 --> 00:40:19.751
We'll get Barry back.

635
00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:22.045
Yeah. But what will he be like
when we do?

636
00:40:58.414 --> 00:40:59.874
You look like death warmed over.

637
00:41:00.792 --> 00:41:01.793
I need your help.

638
00:41:03.294 --> 00:41:04.879
Barry. what the hell is going on?

639
00:41:06.881 --> 00:41:07.924
Injustice.
