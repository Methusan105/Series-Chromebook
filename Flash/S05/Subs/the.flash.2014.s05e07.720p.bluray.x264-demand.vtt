00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.750
<i>My name is Barry Allen.</i>

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.433
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.190
<i>To the outside world.</i>

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.192
<i>I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist.</i>

5
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.357
<i>But secretly.
with the help of my friends</i>

6
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.954
<i>at S.T.A.R. Labs.
I fight crime</i>

7
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.157
<i>and find other meta-humans
like me.</i>

8
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.550
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help.</i>

9
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.676
<i>she changed the present.</i>

10
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.475
<i>And now our world is
more dangerous than ever.</i>

11
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.836
<i>and I'm the only one fast
enough to save it.</i>

12
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.429
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

13
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.079
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

14
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.231
<i>To be able to control
the weather like that indoors.</i>

15
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.357
<i>He'd have to be
a weather wizard.</i>

16
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.476
<i>This is Sherloque.</i>

17
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.776
<i>He's the greatest detective</i>

18
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.439
<i>in all the multiverse.</i>

19
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.816
<i>I'm here to catch your killer.</i>

20
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.354
The only part
of the satellite

21
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.750
that would have dark matter
levels that high...

22
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.639
<i>Is the core. which is
where Cicada's dagger came from.</i>

23
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.234
We got a list from FEMA
of everyone

24
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.896
<i>who reported injuries
the night of the Enlightenment.</i>

25
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.071
Two of them are twins
whose father is deceased.

26
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.470
third is a ten-year-old girl
by the name of Grace Gibbons.

27
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.756
So if my dad's right
and Cicada's a father. then...

28
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.638
We may have just found
his daughter.

29
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.830
<i>Excuse me. could you tell
me where Grace Gibbons' room is?</i>

30
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.434
<i>One sec. let me check.</i>

31
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.231
Actually. yeah.
she's that first room

32
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.039
<i>- right on the right.
- Great.</i>

33
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.496
<i>Just where do you think
you're going?</i>

34
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.136
Into my patient's room
is what it looks like.

35
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.720
I'm sorry.
I am Barry Allen.

36
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.678
I'm with the CCPD.

37
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.594
<i>I was hoping to speak
with you. actually.</i>

38
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.672
I'm looking
for Grace Gibbons' parents.

39
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.399
Specifically her father.

40
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.552
I'm sorry. but the girl's
parents are deceased.

41
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.957
Are you sure about that?

42
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.555
I can show you her charts.

43
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.559
See for yourself.

44
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.238
She came in with
a wave of new admissions.

45
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.915
No legal guardian listed.
no next of kin.

46
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.559
The sad truth is.

47
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.951
our staff is the only family
this little girl has left.

48
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.633
Okay.

49
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.837
Thank you for your help.

50
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.320
<i>Orlin Dwyer.
are you in there?</i>

51
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.518
It's CCPD.
Open up.

52
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.876
- Orlin Dwyer?
- Hey. listen. man.

53
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.599
I don't care
what that guy says.

54
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.353
he was drunk
and I was defending...

55
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.160
This is about your sister.
Mr. Dwyer.

56
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.199
There's been an accident.
a meta attack.

57
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.956
- Careful.
- I know. I know.

58
00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.430
- This is a critical time.
<i>- Okay.</i>

59
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.557
- Steady hands.
- Yeah.

60
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.840
Call time of death.

61
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.196
<i>It's okay. It's a pie.</i>

62
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.476
It's not supposed to be
a piece of cake.

63
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.676
Wow.

64
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.954
Hey. thanks for helping.

65
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.679
With Cicada's trail
running cold.

66
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.400
at least we have the extra day
to prepare

67
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.113
for our first Thanksgiving
at the loft.

68
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.237
What about Joe and Cecile?

69
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.789
They're celebrating
with Cecile's family this year.

70
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.634
So. yeah. this year it's just
gonna be the five of us.

71
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.632
<i>- I'm down.</i>
- Six. actually.

72
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.518
Killer Frost just RSVP'd.

73
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.832
What... you guys can just talk
to each other now.

74
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.560
even without the mental
activity dampener?

75
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.313
Yeah. today's actually
the first time.

76
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.800
Wow.

77
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.075
Oh. gosh.

78
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.270
- Hi. guys.
- Yo.

79
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.496
Sorry we're late.
It seems like

80
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.113
everyone and their grandma
is getting

81
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.475
pre-holiday manis and pedis.

82
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.791
Ooh. let's take photos
and post them

83
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.430
on that old-fashioned Insta
thingy that you guys use.

84
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.751
Those two seemed to have
really patched things up.

85
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.193
Yeah. Nora's getting closer
to Iris than she is with me.

86
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.816
and the timing couldn't have
been better.

87
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.194
What do you mean?

88
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.397
I mean.
Nora was so young

89
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.119
when I disappeared in
her future.

90
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.760
so this would be her
first memory of Thanksgiving

91
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.115
with both her parents.

92
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.759
Feel like it's my job
to make it

93
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.479
the most perfect
Thanksgiving ever.

94
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.951
And #HandModels.

95
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.477
Wow. I feel famous already.

96
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.755
Oh. man.

97
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.638
Mom. um...

98
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.949
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.191
Sorry for what. Nora?

100
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.876
For not giving you a chance
to show me how great you are.

101
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.391
This year I'm just really
thankful to get to know you.

102
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.676
The real you.

103
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.433
I'm thankful too.

104
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.831
You know. the West-Allens have
never missed a Thanksgiving.

105
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.196
No guerrilla army.
no evil speedster.

106
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.431
no giant wormhole in the sky

107
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.715
could break that streak.

108
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.393
Yeah. the singularity.

109
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.830
So the Flash Museum has
a 3-D model of Dad

110
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.879
just running straight into it
to save the city.

111
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.714
God. it must have been so epic
to be there.

112
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.599
Actually. it was...

113
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.320
terrifying to be there.

114
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.392
We didn't know if your dad
was gonna come back.

115
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.120
<i>Ronnie didn't.</i>

116
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.318
What?

117
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.759
The museum says that...
that Dad just saved everybody.

118
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.793
I guess there's things
the museum left out.

119
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.496
<i>Like your Dad giving himself
to the Speed Force</i>

120
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.000
<i>to save the city.</i>

121
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.994
That was another time we said
good-bye thinking...

122
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.992
might be a one-way trip.

123
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.074
Sounds a lot like what took
him from us in the future.

124
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.550
I didn't know Dad had
so many close calls.

125
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.074
<i>Look. your dad
is always gonna</i>

126
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.800
<i>wanna put his life
on the line for others.</i>

127
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.958
<i>That is what I love most
about him.</i>

128
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.034
but. yeah. it... it
does keep me up at night.

129
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.794
Did he come back?

130
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.193
No. the records I falsified
convinced him for now.

131
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.840
<i>So we're safe?</i>

132
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.197
Orlin. I think you need
to stay away.

133
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.953
Good idea.

134
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.509
I won't visit till
after the weekend.

135
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.997
No. I think you need to stay
away for good.

136
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.390
It's getting too risky.

137
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.194
You want me to give up Grace?

138
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.839
<i>No. no. no. listen.</i>

139
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.559
you can't put me on hold.

140
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.474
I don't care about
this next of kin crap.

141
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.792
I don't want this kid.
Hello?

142
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.200
Hello?

143
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.272
Damn it.

144
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.637
Hey...

145
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.200
what?

146
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.954
It's breakfast.

147
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.076
Yeah. it is.
Um...

148
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.557
Okay.

149
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.234
Now look. it's only
a few days old.

150
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.999
It's still good. I swear.

151
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.913
I don't understand.
Explain again to me

152
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.400
what the difference
between this day

153
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.039
and every other day
in America?

154
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.079
It's a holiday
when we all get together

155
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.470
and celebrate
and eat a ton of food.

156
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.074
Like. a gross amount.

157
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.550
Again. what the difference
between this day

158
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.154
and every other day in America.

159
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.280
- That's legit.
- Hi. guys.

160
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.874
- What's going on?
- This guy.

161
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.536
he try to explain
the Thanksgiving holiday.

162
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.791
<i>He's failing miserably.
What is this holiday?</i>

163
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.997
- Please explain.
- It's very simple. actually.

164
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.696
It's just about getting
together to celebrate

165
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.313
our loved ones and family.

166
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.076
So simple. this is why I
don't understand this holiday.

167
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.096
- I don't have any family.
- Didn't you have. like.

168
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.954
- seven marriages?
- I did have seven marriages.

169
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.590
Five wives. seven marriages.
but no family.

170
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.554
This holiday
is a cruel holiday.

171
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.016
- What's going on?
<i>- I'm seeing a massive</i>

172
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.997
electrical surge
at the power station downtown.

173
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.639
Barry. Nora. you're up.

174
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.954
Guys. what's the problem?

175
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.997
Everything looks...

176
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.639
I think we found it.

177
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.552
- It's lightning.
- Skies were clear

178
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.416
a minute ago. That storm must
have come out of nowhere.

179
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.557
Uh. we got a bigger problem.

180
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.472
<i>There's an experimental
cold fusion core</i>

181
00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.791
from Mercury Labs in the plant.
and if it blows...

182
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.679
<i>It could take out
the whole block.</i>

183
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.035
I see it.

184
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.278
Nora. you've got to evac all
the workers to safety. Barry...

185
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.776
Yeah. I know.
I got to grab the core.

186
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.951
No. no. no.
something doesn't feel right.

187
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.839
Just listen to Iris.
Grab the workers from inside.

188
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.711
Dad!

189
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.553
You guys.
he's not breathing.

190
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.915
He's going into
cardiac arrest.

191
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.136
<i>She needs to restart his heart.</i>

192
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.640
What... how do I do that?

193
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.296
Rub your hands together
to create lightning.

194
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.834
<i>and then give him
a chest compression.</i>

195
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.240
Okay! Okay.

196
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.915
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

197
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.793
It's not working!

198
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.556
We lost him.

199
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.030
<i>No! No!</i>

200
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.589
No!

201
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.598
Please. Please. Please.

202
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.956
<i>He's back.</i>

203
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.076
- I promise I'm okay.
- Caitlin.

204
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.197
His vitals are stable.
Speed healing to the rescue.

205
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.496
He shouldn't have
needed rescuing.

206
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.795
<i>Nora. I know you're upset.</i>

207
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.056
but if that core would
have exploded

208
00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.176
it would have caused
a lot of damage.

209
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.237
It did cause a lot of damage.
Dad died.

210
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.154
We made the best decision we
could. given the circumstances.

211
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.550
Maybe someone else should be
making our decisions.

212
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.274
Wow. all right. well.

213
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.670
so much for mother-daughter
holiday time.

214
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.638
She did just have to bring me
back to life.

215
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.837
- Let's give her a minute.
- Okay.

216
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.594
In the meantime.
where did that storm come from?

217
00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.512
A storm like that coming
and going.

218
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.000
disappearing in a matter
of minutes.

219
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.474
it shouldn't be possible.

220
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.597
Unless someone was making
it possible.

221
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.080
I mean. we've seen that before.

222
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.656
Weather Wizard.
But Mark Mardon is serving

223
00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.080
a life sentence
at Iron Heights.

224
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.879
Let's make sure he's doing
just that.

225
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.600
Let us know if any other
weather anomalies

226
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.960
pop up on the radar.

227
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.440
Okay.

228
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.920
Will do.

229
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.836
Save the Turkey.

230
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.070
What...?

231
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.231
Art is therapy.

232
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.640
So. Sherlock...

233
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.473
Sherloque.
simple pronunciation.

234
00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.473
We heard what you had to say
about not having a family.

235
00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.120
- Right.
- And we here at Team Flash are

236
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.376
sort of a family. and you're
becoming part of that family.

237
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.960
so we would like to invite you

238
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.760
to celebrate
Thanksgiving with us.

239
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.799
Caitlin. I'm afraid that
I must decline. all right?

240
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.616
Because I don't have a lot
of reason to celebrate.

241
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.791
and you of all people should
sympathize with that.

242
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.958
- Why should I sympathize?
<i>- You lost your father. right?</i>

243
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.191
And then you find him
only to discover that his body

244
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.999
<i>is being possessed
by a icicle demon</i>

245
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.456
<i>who's trying to kill
all of Team Flash.</i>

246
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.551
<i>yourself included.
Not great. right?</i>

247
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.016
Okay. that's enough.
Debbie Downer.

248
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.474
Don't listen.
You know what?

249
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.273
Maybe you should lay off
the paint fumes.

250
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.919
Do you know what.
young Ralph Macchio?

251
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.576
You have nothing
to celebrate either. right?

252
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.273
What your last year has been.
huh?

253
00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.397
Let me recap for you.
First. heartbreak.

254
00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.912
And then second.
Cicada crushes your powers

255
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.480
forcing you to fake
your own death.

256
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.870
<i>also not great. and as for me.</i>

257
00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.792
multiple divorces have left me

258
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.236
with a mountain of debt
that's insurmountable.

259
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:53.394
So this past year. not been
very kind to any of us.

260
00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.312
Pardon.

261
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.696
<i>She's had a few
recent outbursts.</i>

262
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.154
<i>and we don't allow
cursing here.</i>

263
00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.397
<i>This type of behavior
cannot continue.</i>

264
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.016
Anyway. that's the long
and short of it.

265
00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.918
I'll give you two a moment.

266
00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.270
You called a kid
a rat bastard?

267
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.874
What's wrong with you?
Don't you know

268
00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.758
you can't go around
saying stuff like that?

269
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.194
Why?

270
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.351
Well. 'cause
then I get a phone call.

271
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.671
You know. I had to take off
work to come down here.

272
00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.514
- You don't even like your job.
- What?

273
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.319
You stay on the couch
all day.

274
00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.550
and then when work calls

275
00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.994
you curse and slam the door.

276
00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.073
"Rat bastards."

277
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.959
Look.
I get where you heard it.

278
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.350
All right. but you can't say
those words.

279
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.715
- Rat bastard!
- Hey. quit it.

280
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.200
- Rat bastard!
- Stop.

281
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.794
- Rat bastards!
- Hey. listen to me!

282
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.240
I'm supposed to be
the parent here.

283
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.233
No. you're not a parent!

284
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.835
Parents are supposed to make
the world better for their kids.

285
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.714
You make everything worse.
I hate you.

286
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.399
and you hate you too.

287
00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.318
<i>You have to excuse
our dim lighting.</i>

288
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.800
Today's storm out
at the power plant

289
00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.479
knocked out our main generator.

290
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.671
So we're working off a backup
for the time being.

291
00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.114
So does that mean
you can't dampen

292
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.032
the meta prisoners' powers?

293
00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.077
Prison-wide dampeners
are down.

294
00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.949
but we got every inmate
into meta cuffs incident free.

295
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.918
I hope you include that in your
article about our readiness.

296
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.456
After the corruption
of the last warden.

297
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.994
I am eager to assure the public

298
00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.191
that their safety
is in good hands.

299
00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.432
Now. our CSI's. which inmate
did you need to see?

300
00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.959
And he's been here all day?

301
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.838
Never once out of our sight.

302
00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.240
There was a crime
committed today

303
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.754
with an MO similar
to Mardon's.

304
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.797
Can I take a look
at the security tapes?

305
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.714
Anything for our friends
in the press.

306
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.037
Well. this is a bust.

307
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.113
Yeah. looks like you died
for nothing.

308
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.669
Nora. hey. hey. look.

309
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.592
This has been a rough day
for you.

310
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.876
but you can't blame Iris
for what happened.

311
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.474
She's doing the best she can.

312
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.597
Besides.
we both decided on the plan.

313
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.353
Oh. I know.

314
00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.759
What the...?

315
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.800
<i>Hey. don't mind me.</i>

316
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.270
I'm just here to pick up
my dad.

317
00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.952
Did she say "dad"?

318
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.110
Joslyn?

319
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.510
It's Joss.

320
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.589
Bring me my father!
Now!

321
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.956
Yeah. that's not
gonna happen.

322
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.520
We'll see about that.

323
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.240
Bring my dad to Porter Plaza
in one hour.

324
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.960
or Central City is gonna
get wrecked.

325
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.954
I didn't know that Joslyn
was busting me out.

326
00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.430
I didn't know she'd do
half the things she does.

327
00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.239
I haven't spoken to her
in years.

328
00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.073
And you expect me
to believe she woke up

329
00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.816
this morning and was like.
"You know what?

330
00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.559
I wanna break my dad
out of Iron Heights."

331
00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.236
I get it. but it's the truth.

332
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:47.109
Joss was born when me and her
mom were still in high school.

333
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.637
I never could work out
how to be with that woman.

334
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.633
Then when Joss came
I thought the best thing to do

335
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.952
was to focus on my career.

336
00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.430
Your criminal career?

337
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.318
That's why I left her
with her mom.

338
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.234
Least until she ran away
because some of falling out.

339
00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.198
What happened with Joss
and her mom?

340
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.237
The last time I spoke to her

341
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:11.358
she told me that her and Joss
are broken.

342
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.920
You know how it is.

343
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.593
Sometimes mothers
and daughters break

344
00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.280
and there ain't no fixing 'em.

345
00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.550
<i>Okay. watch your step.</i>

346
00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:39.873
And open your eyes.

347
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.199
<i>Whose house is this?</i>

348
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.272
It's my cousin Robbie's.

349
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.716
He doesn't live here anymore.
but he said

350
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.520
if I fix it up.
we could stay here.

351
00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.600
What's this?

352
00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.515
That is a dollhouse.

353
00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.354
Or it can be

354
00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:04.559
once we build it.
and. you know. you can...

355
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.431
Pick out furniture. and colors.

356
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.072
or wall paper.
decorate it how you want.

357
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.712
Hey...

358
00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.837
I know we didn't get off
to the greatest start

359
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.832
these past few months.

360
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.230
Okay...

361
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.198
it was a lousy start.

362
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.875
But I want to fix all that.

363
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.916
Well. I was thinking that
while I work on this place.

364
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.837
we could work
on this one too... together.

365
00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.836
Listen. you were right. kid.

366
00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.798
I do hate me.

367
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.475
<i>I don't really know
any other way to be.</i>

368
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:54.032
but I want to do right by you.
Gracie.

369
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:59.354
I want to keep you safe.
and warm. fed...

370
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.595
You know. just...

371
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.798
give you all the things
a kid should have.

372
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.351
Let's start with
the dollhouse.

373
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.233
Okay.

374
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.794
Okay.

375
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.276
How's Dad's interrogation
going?

376
00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.576
Well. we'll know in a minute.
Hopefully. he'll find something

377
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.136
that'll help us profile
Mardon's daughter.

378
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.277
Okay. well. let me know.

379
00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.920
Nora. look. listen.
I know you're upset with me

380
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.071
for sending your dad
into that situation earlier.

381
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.839
and I just...

382
00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.116
- I wanted to say that I...
- Mom. it's okay.

383
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.680
I'm not upset with you.

384
00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.479
- You're not?
- No. we're good.

385
00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.313
I-I promise.

386
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.631
Okay. cool.

387
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.030
That's the other thing.
celebrating the decimation

388
00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.874
of an indigenous culture
so a bunch of greedy colonizers

389
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.792
can get their turkey-lurkey on.

390
00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.576
Do you know about this?
Do you know about the sham?

391
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.717
The sham we call
"Thanksgiving."

392
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.712
Okay. I'm sorry.
am I missing something?

393
00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.110
Since when did you guys become
anti-Thanksgiving?

394
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.351
Since a bunch of guys wearing
hat-buckles

395
00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.518
fed us some old bull.
wrapped in lies.

396
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.831
<i>stuffed in propaganda.</i>

397
00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.832
It's a deception Turducken.

398
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.639
Actually.
I think the hat-buckles

399
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.030
- weren't real either.
- Don't encourage him.

400
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.271
- You get it.
- Okay.

401
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.640
Did you get anything
from Mardon?

402
00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.240
No. nothing that'll help us
find his daughter.

403
00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.456
What about you guys?
What'd you dig up?

404
00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.073
Meet Joss Jackam.

405
00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.550
She is a delinquent teen
turned amateur storm chaser.

406
00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.075
<i>A self-taught expert
in theoretical meteorology.</i>

407
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.640
How do we know
she's a storm chaser?

408
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.552
'Cause Helen Hunt
here has a blog.

409
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.314
Mm-hmm. She lost her grant
from the Science Center

410
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.456
for doing too many dangerous
experiments on the weather.

411
00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.235
Well. look like she's way
beyond the experimental phase.

412
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.391
Ooh. Weather Witch?

413
00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.795
I'll allow it.

414
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.872
Dad. that weathervane.

415
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.917
doesn't it look a lot like...

416
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.878
The staff she was carrying.
yeah.

417
00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.640
<i>Cisco. can you pull up
the security footage</i>

418
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.936
from her attack
on Iron Heights?

419
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.713
<i>Sure can.</i>

420
00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.319
<i>It's infected
with a satellite shard.</i>

421
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.869
- She's got meta-tech.
- Like Spencer Young's phone.

422
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.077
Look. she has instant
lightning on command.

423
00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.336
There's no way
you're gonna be able

424
00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.589
to get that staff from her.

425
00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.096
She's gonna have
to give it up willingly.

426
00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.474
Okay. listen.
we got 20 minutes

427
00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.936
before she destroys
the entire city.

428
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.679
so what is the plan?

429
00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.190
We only have one choice.

430
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.875
We give her what she wants.

431
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.073
No Weather Witch in sight.

432
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.576
<i>Okay.
Singh cleared the perimeter.</i>

433
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.034
so it's free of civilians.

434
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.271
And our satellites
are on weather watch

435
00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.272
for our Weather Witch.
Nothing yet.

436
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.953
Well...

437
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.872
I wouldn't say nothing.

438
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.758
<i>My data leaves me to conclude</i>

439
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.354
that there is
artificially-created

440
00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.079
pressure system
of uncertain origin

441
00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.675
headed <i>rapidement</i>
toward the downtown core.

442
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.479
Listen. Galileo.
you can lick your finger

443
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.074
and stick it in the wind
all you want.

444
00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.958
Why don't you leave
the actual calculations

445
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.278
to actual compu...
oh. for Christ's sake.

446
00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.000
And your exasperation
leads me also to conclude

447
00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.912
that you have realized.
although late.

448
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.799
that once again I'm right.
I'm right. I'm right.

449
00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.156
<i>I'm right. I'm right...</i>

450
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.430
That's enough out of you.

451
00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.474
She's here.

452
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.520
So the rotten apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

453
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.672
You're a poet.
Awesome.

454
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.114
Where's my dad?

455
00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.600
All right. Joss. we held up
our end of the bargain.

456
00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.875
You got your dad.

457
00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.394
There's no reason
to hurt anybody...

458
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.960
Ah. so boring. Come on.

459
00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.037
We'll handle it from here.

460
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.520
Hey. baby girl.

461
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.114
Dad.

462
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.714
That's a pretty cool staff.

463
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.440
Would you just... how about
you just power

464
00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.678
that thing off for a sec
and let your dad try.

465
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:47.759
Try this.

466
00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.310
Oh. no.

467
00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.154
Oh.

468
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.080
Oh. oh. don't feel bad.
He was a selfish dick

469
00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.197
who abandoned his family.

470
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.280
Anyway. thanks for helping me
drop a truck on my dad.

471
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.271
Uh... guys?

472
00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.477
What now?

473
00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.671
I didn't see the Hummer coming.

474
00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.116
I'm so pissed!

475
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.034
This city will drown.

476
00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.591
crumble. burn.
because of you!

477
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.719
Thanks.

478
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.757
I'm gonna follow her.

479
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.559
Wait. are you serious
right now?

480
00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.154
- What?
- You almost just died.

481
00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.118
Again. and you don't
seem to care.

482
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.429
Where is this coming from?

483
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.034
You know how dangerous
our job is.

484
00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.720
Yeah. but I don't want
to lose you again.

485
00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.320
but you don't seem to give
a damn if you lose me.

486
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.675
and... and all for your job.

487
00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.160
Nora.

488
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.439
How long you been holding
that one in?

489
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.796
My best guess...

490
00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.633
my whole life.

491
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.399
Growing up without you.
I was so angry...

492
00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.952
but you were my hero. so...

493
00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.556
it was easier to put my anger
for you not being around

494
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:56.238
on criminals
and meta-villains...

495
00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.232
a lot of times on Mom.

496
00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.160
But when I saw you die today

497
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.836
it reminded me that

498
00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:11.120
I'm mad at someone else
about losing you...

499
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.715
you.

500
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.359
I get it.

501
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.439
It's not easy having a parent

502
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.477
who puts their life on the line
for others.

503
00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.950
I remember feeling
the same way about Joe

504
00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:30.398
- being a cop when I was a kid.
- No. it's not the same thing.

505
00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.676
Did he ever have to say
good-bye to you knowing

506
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.793
that he wasn't coming back?

507
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.792
You did...

508
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.111
and you're gonna do it again.

509
00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.856
Nora. you got to remember
you're talking about

510
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.553
a future that we might be able
to avoid.

511
00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.677
We still have time to find
our way to a solution.

512
00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.274
<i>and we will.</i>

513
00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.000
But there is a solution.

514
00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.993
It's just one
that you don't want.

515
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.599
Give up being The Flash.

516
00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.717
Come on.
It's the only way to guarantee

517
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.598
that you won't disappear again
in the future.

518
00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.796
or any other time.

519
00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.520
- Nora.
- Come on. Think about it.

520
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.557
You're not the only hero.

521
00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.872
Let the others protect
the world.

522
00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.158
You don't have to keep
sacrificing yourself.

523
00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.550
You give your life
again and again.

524
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.075
How many times
does it have to be you?

525
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.197
It hurt so much

526
00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.114
losing you
when I didn't even know you.

527
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.238
but now
after all of these months

528
00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.232
getting to know you I just...

529
00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.317
please. Dad. don't make me go
through it again.

530
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.120
I don't want to go through
it again.

531
00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.832
Nora. people need The Flash.

532
00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.232
I need my dad.

533
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.720
<i>This is the third
ice cream of the day. you know?</i>

534
00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:24.515
Something fishy's going
on here.

535
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.434
Okay. you got me.

536
00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.840
We're celebrating

537
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.834
because this is
a very special day.

538
00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.599
One year ago today.

539
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.637
I made you a promise

540
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.279
that I would turn
my life around

541
00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.397
and make things better for you.

542
00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.314
I can honestly say
that my life

543
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.996
is a million times better
than what it was.

544
00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.720
And it's all because of you.
Gracie.

545
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.679
So I got you something.

546
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.712
It's the set I wanted.

547
00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:01.237
I thought your little
dollhouse could use a family.

548
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.715
I already have one.

549
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.917
I love you. kiddo.

550
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.393
- Purple.
- You know. I think four

551
00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.473
ice creams in a day
would be the...

552
00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.073
Gracie. run.

553
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.197
Run. Run. Come on!

554
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.356
Go this way!
Go this way!

555
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.793
Help me!

556
00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.360
Help me. please!

557
00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.353
- Sir.
- Somebody!

558
00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.716
Save her. please.

559
00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:42.350
Get him on a table.

560
00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.429
Move!

561
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.040
<i>Gracie...</i>

562
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.353
<i>Help her...</i>

563
00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.039
<i>On the eve of Thanksgiving.</i>

564
00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.635
<i>reports of devastating
weather phenomena</i>

565
00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.110
<i>are streaming in
from all over the city.</i>

566
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.432
<i>The exact cause of these
disturbances remains unknown.</i>

567
00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.896
I can't believe
she's actually willing

568
00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.310
to level the city
to kill one man.

569
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.153
She doesn't know
where Mardon is.

570
00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.336
It's overkill. but it's
the only option we've left her.

571
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.033
Well. Caitlin's on radar.

572
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.616
and Cisco's trying
to juice the satellites.

573
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.633
but there's interference.
We can't locate Joss.

574
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.514
You okay?

575
00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.193
Look. babe.
you're gonna find the words

576
00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.158
to make her understand.
I know it.

577
00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.233
Not sure I have the words
to make myself understand.

578
00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.073
She's got a point.

579
00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.875
We got a hit on Joss.

580
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.553
She's at
Sheldon County Airport.

581
00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.518
Barry. you got to move.

582
00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.216
- You're good?
<i>- Barry. do you have eyes</i>

583
00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.754
<i>- on Joss?</i>
- No. she's damaged

584
00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.155
the terminal so badly

585
00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.754
<i>the hangar's the
only safe place.</i>

586
00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.236
I'm evacuating everyone
trapped on the tarmac.

587
00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.549
I think I can bring
Frost out.

588
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.472
- What can we do?
- Flood control

589
00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:11.960
down at the Marina.

590
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.760
Guys. how do we fight
weather?

591
00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.635
We fight weather
with weather.

592
00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.200
Nora.

593
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.680
We still have
Mardon's weather wand.

594
00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.096
I need you to get it
from the archives

595
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.520
and take it to Barry. okay?

596
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.637
Okay.

597
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.957
- Hey.
- Hey.

598
00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.912
Mardon's wand?
Cisco says you can use it

599
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.753
to counteract Joss's weather.

600
00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.194
Where is she?

601
00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.512
Last chance.
Where's my Dad?

602
00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.000
Joss. you know
we can't give him up.

603
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.278
Then you know
what happens next.

604
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.432
Joss. I deceived you. okay?
Not them.

605
00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.159
You want make someone pay.
it's me.

606
00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.631
This is how you make
heroes pay!

607
00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.677
By the beard of Zeus.
she's making

608
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.753
a tornado out of lightning.

609
00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.757
Cisco. how do I use this wand
to stop this?

610
00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.536
<i>You can attract
all the lightning to the wand.</i>

611
00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.280
That'll take down the tornado.
but all that energy

612
00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.555
will go through your body.

613
00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.359
You'll be a human
lightning rod.

614
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.749
It's okay.

615
00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.354
I know you have to go.

616
00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.197
Run. Dad. Run!

617
00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.236
Back.
Everybody. back.

618
00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.200
Barry?
Nora. do you see him?

619
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.153
<i>I. uh...</i>

620
00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.596
I...

621
00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.632
I see him.
He's still here.

622
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.960
<i>We live in a world
full of meta-phones</i>

623
00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.360
<i>and meta-weathervanes.</i>

624
00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.193
What's next?
My electric toothbrush?

625
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.511
Till we figure out
how to remove those shards.

626
00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:45.109
better safe than sorry.
Yeah.

627
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.873
Well. now that Mardon
and his daughter

628
00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.191
are all tucked away
in Iron Heights.

629
00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.193
what do you say we spend
some time with our own family?

630
00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.159
Well. might just be
us and Nora this year.

631
00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.516
Caitlin and Cisco
are skipping Thanksgiving.

632
00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.954
What? Why?

633
00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.839
- Don't even ask.
- What?

634
00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.640
- A toast to...
- Mm-hmm.

635
00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.791
The thankless.

636
00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.678
- The thankless!
- The thankless!

637
00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.240
The thankless!

638
00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.595
<i>Allez-oop.</i>

639
00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.399
- Mm.
- Mm.

640
00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:16.120
Aw.

641
00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.790
All right. boys.
I'm tapping in.

642
00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.473
Okay. let me get this straight.

643
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.597
You two losers are sitting here

644
00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.912
in what I can only assume is
the cantina of a starship.

645
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.038
<i>drinking and eating
terrible food</i>

646
00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.794
when you could be drinking
and eating amazing food

647
00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.440
with people who actually
care about you.

648
00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.759
All right. all right. look.

649
00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.559
When you put it
like that...

650
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.597
- She has a point.
- You have a point. yeah.

651
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.354
And. by the way. I have the
least to celebrate this year

652
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.274
because I spent
most of it unconscious.

653
00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.231
You nerds coming
to Thanksgiving. or what?

654
00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:02.389
<i>So it wasn't so much
the taste as it was the crunch.</i>

655
00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.800
Wait. are you actually
saying...

656
00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.758
Yes. that was the year
I found out

657
00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.799
why Grandma Esther's yams
tasted so good.

658
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.792
because she never cleaned
her favorite skillet.

659
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.798
I take it this was
also the year

660
00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.520
you stopped eating
Grandma Esther's yams?

661
00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.399
Uh-uh. I didn't say all that.

662
00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.397
Allow me to propose a toast.

663
00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.917
Well.
first to clean dishware.

664
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.351
and also to... to family.
all right.

665
00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:35.638
and to friends.
old and new.

666
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.800
And to the colonizers
who conquered this land...

667
00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.917
<i>- What?
- And...</i>

668
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.435
<i>- the colonizers who grabbed...
- Remember... no...</i>

669
00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.056
What they want.
they just take what they want.

670
00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.936
- Yes. I know. but our...
<i>- To taking what you...</i>

671
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.111
That's not... you know what?
Let's go.

672
00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.456
- Right now.
- Okay. you know what?

673
00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.632
I think that it's time
to go carve the turkey.

674
00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:56.995
Great.

675
00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.231
Nora.

676
00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.671
Um. we didn't have a chance to
talk since the airport.

677
00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.240
Oh. Dad. I know
what you're gonna say.

678
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.674
and you don't have to.

679
00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.319
I saw what it was like

680
00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.357
when you hesitated
to save those people

681
00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:13.514
because of me.
and I felt...

682
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.160
- Horrible?
- Yeah.

683
00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.709
And I never want to feel
like that again.

684
00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.031
I get it.

685
00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:26.752
Sometimes you have to sacrifice
yourself to save others.

686
00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.196
Even if it means leaving
your family behind.

687
00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.397
Not exactly.

688
00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:35.713
Look. when I ran
into that storm I was thinking

689
00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.713
I want to save everyone.
but...

690
00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:42.874
the person I was thinking
about the most was you.

691
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.397
- Me?
- Yeah.

692
00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:51.236
I don't choose being The Flash
over being with my family.

693
00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.154
I'm The Flash for my family.

694
00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.038
and I don't have to run
to the future

695
00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.840
to understand why
I sacrificed myself.

696
00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:02.271
I'd do it to save you.
and your mom.

697
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.357
all the people I love.

698
00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.399
You know. maybe one day
if I train enough.

699
00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.358
I'll be able to save you.

700
00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.600
I don't doubt it.

701
00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.750
- All right. come on.
- Okay.

702
00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.274
- Ah. yes.
- All right.

703
00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.840
- Hey. thank God.
- Carve the turkey.

704
00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.957
- Yeah. baby.
<i>- Here we are.</i>

705
00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.474
- Each person gets a turkey.
- No.

706
00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.153
- Oh.
- We have the one for everyone.

707
00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.856
- You all right?
- Just Dad with a knife.

708
00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.536
- it's a little...
- It's the most fun part.

709
00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.856
<i>♪♪ I got all
my sisters with me ♪♪</i>

710
00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.678
<i>Oh. you're very good
at that.</i>

711
00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:34.035
Am I?

712
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.560
<i>Orlin.</i>

713
00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.316
I told you it's too risky.

714
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.189
CCPD's already looking for you.
What are you doing here?

715
00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:58.877
It's Thanksgiving. Doc.
I'm here to be with my family.

716
00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.952
<i>I want you to be optimistic.</i>

717
00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.520
but I'm not gonna lie to you.

718
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.273
As far as how long.

719
00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.556
with all the brain hemorrhaging
she suffered.

720
00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.757
<i>you have to prepare yourself
for the possibility</i>

721
00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.878
<i>that she may never wake.</i>

722
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:27.352
This is all my fault.

723
00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:30.512
<i>No. it's these metas.</i>

724
00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.637
Wreaking havoc unchecked.

725
00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.235
<i>She didn't deserve this.
Mr. Dwyer.</i>

726
00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.553
and neither did you.

727
00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.309
<i>This was the scene
Tuesday night as. once again.</i>

728
00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.598
<i>The Flash saved Central City
from certain destruction.</i>

729
00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.512
<i>After a world-wide
power outage</i>

730
00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.637
<i>blanketed every country
in darkness.</i>

731
00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:00.157
<i>a bizarre purple...</i>

732
00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.436
<i>The destructive phenomenon
emanated</i>

733
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.159
<i>from a satellite
that had fallen</i>

734
00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.118
<i>into a decaying orbit.</i>

735
00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.476
<i>Thankfully. before
the satellite could strike</i>

736
00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.075
<i>the city and create
what scientists believe</i>

737
00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.231
<i>would have been
"a catastrophic event."</i>

738
00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.199
<i>The Flash was able
to destroy it.</i>

739
00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:19.000
<i>Once again. residents
of our proud city.</i>

740
00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.914
<i>and perhaps the entire world
owe The Flash</i>

741
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.198
<i>and his allies...</i>

742
00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.918
<i>A new meta was last seen
jumping off a building</i>

743
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.674
<i>in order to evade capture
after stealing jewels...</i>

744
00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.200
<i>It was reported that
he escaped Flash's grasp</i>

745
00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.717
<i>after hijacking
an armored vehicle.</i>

746
00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.958
<i>I'm gonna make this
right. Gracie.</i>

747
00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:03.954
Every meta...

748
00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:06.475
will die.

749
00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.553
Guys. this better be good.

750
00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.480
Yeah. we've got an
after-Thanksgiving tradition

751
00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:20.473
called sleeping.
so what's up?

752
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.836
It's good. Trust us.
Detective.

753
00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.071
Well.
it occurred to me that if you.

754
00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.640
monsieur and madam West-Allen.

755
00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.599
you want to spend this holiday
with your family.

756
00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:32.479
Well. perhaps your meta-killer
does as well.

757
00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:35.234
So I had monsieur Cisco hack
into the CCTV footage

758
00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:39.234
<i>of the hospital
and this what we got.</i>

759
00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.755
Ever since Grace arrived.

760
00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:45.038
only one man has come
to visit her.

761
00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.112
<i>Every day.</i>

762
00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.634
<i>Including tonight.</i>

763
00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.194
Team Flash.
I give you...

764
00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:55.552
Orlin Dwyer.
also known as...

765
00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.120
Cicada.

766
00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.040
<i>Greg. move your head.</i>
