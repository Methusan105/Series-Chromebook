00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.110
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.237
- Caitlin!
- Dad.

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.270
I'll always love you.

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.676
You took our daughter
back to the future?

5
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.160
I can't trust her.

6
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.840
Thawne is manipulating her.

7
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.071
Follow my instructions
and we will defeat Cicada.

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.714
<i>destroy his dagger.</i>

9
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.870
and save your father.

10
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.758
You created
your own Speed Force?

11
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.035
Yes. I did.

12
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.576
<i>And I can access it
to go back in time.</i>

13
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.637
- How could he leave me?
- Nora...

14
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.518
How could he stop
loving me?

15
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.991
<i>- She's gone.</i>
- Gone where?

16
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.914
I don't know where.
I only know when: 2019.

17
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.952
Gideon. scan servers
for blueprints

18
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.271
from McCulloch Technologies.

19
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.871
Gotcha.

20
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.680
Gideon. infiltration analysis.

21
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.036
<i>Yes. Nora West-Allen.</i>

22
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.191
<i>The odds of accessing
this location on your own</i>

23
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.350
<i>are 1 in 3 million.</i>

24
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.080
<i>Shall I send a request
to Barry Allen?</i>

25
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.640
No. Gideon.

26
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.559
I need people
who can actually help me.

27
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.000
Tachyon scanners set up

28
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.117
at every half-mile interval
across the city.

29
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.396
And the seismometer
is searching for sonic booms

30
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.914
in the hundred-megahertz range.

31
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.913
As for the satellites.
I've got Carrie. Charlotte.

32
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.992
Miranda. and Samantha scanning

33
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.776
for her yellow-purple
lightning signatures.

34
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.871
I am clearly the Samantha
of this group. right?

35
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.231
- Yeah. okay. Miranda.
- Ugh.

36
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.279
So. technically.
if Nora uses the Speed Force...

37
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.591
We'll find her.

38
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.193
Kinda thought
she'd pop right up.

39
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.280
If she's even here.

40
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.440
How can you guys be so sure

41
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.576
that she even came back
from the future in the first place?

42
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.273
Because Thawne sent her.

43
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.696
He showed her a new way
to time-travel.

44
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.154
something that can't
be detected.

45
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.197
But as soon as she starts
running again.

46
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.456
we're gonna be able
to bring her home.

47
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.392
Well. Team Flash.

48
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.791
Nora West-Allen is not the only
time traveler who's absent.

49
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.792
We've been running down
abandoned buildings.

50
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.656
- foreclosed condos...
- Anywhere that Grace Gibbons

51
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.176
may have hidden
her younger self. but...

52
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.200
We got bupkis.

53
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.316
And we have no idea why

54
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.232
she stole the Cryo-Atomizer.

55
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.916
except that it was worth
killing my dad for.

56
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.435
Hey. if you need more time...

57
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.512
Yeah. we're more than capable
of chasing

58
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.479
a wild goose or two
on our own.

59
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.517
Thank you. I'm fine.

60
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.080
I'd rather be working.

61
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.976
On that note.
I'm happy to help you

62
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.216
follow that lead
on the atomizer.

63
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.435
Really?

64
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.871
- What about... Sherluck?
- Sherloque.

65
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.096
Do you think any of you will
get this right at any point

66
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.759
at any time in your life?
Sherloque.

67
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.639
No. I'm going to continue
the quest for Nora West-Allen.

68
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.839
I... feel somewhat responsible.

69
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.559
Hmm.

70
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.720
Hey. it's CCPD...
there was a break-in

71
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.757
at an architecture firm
on 34th and Williamson.

72
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.990
Meta-suspect.

73
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.878
Citizens reporting
an explosion there.

74
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.310
Sounds like you guys might
need an extra set of hands.

75
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.959
I'll grab my gear.

76
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.316
Oh.

77
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.551
There's an alert at my dad's
old lab in the Arctic.

78
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.438
We should check it out.

79
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.874
Yeah. better wash
my long johns.

80
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.960
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

81
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.236
You gonna get that or...

82
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.360
Yeah. I'm going to get it.

83
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.959
but I know already
it's Renee Aldler...

84
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.360
- Adler.
- Adler.

85
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.040
With these emoticon pictogram
things that she send me.

86
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.238
Oh. master detective like you
can't decode a few emojis?

87
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.591
I can decode these emojis
no problem. huh?

88
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.911
Heart. she like me.
Kissy face. want to kiss me.

89
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.776
Peach. eggplant.
she like fruit and vegetable.

90
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.315
At this point
with the other René Aldlers.

91
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.392
we are not keeping secrets
from one another.

92
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.550
Well. I did it.

93
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.872
Every exercise.
every intention.

94
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.310
and now that Kamilla and I
are hunky-dory...

95
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.312
You have completed
the Book of Ralph.

96
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.056
- I sure did.
- Thank you for your service.

97
00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.456
old friend.
but your job isn't done yet.

98
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.960
Shirley. I think you
could use this.

99
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.110
Oh. no. no. no. no. no.

100
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.536
What. do you think I need
help with a breakup?

101
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.960
Oh. come on.
Look. Addendum C...

102
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.952
Appendix four.

103
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.616
A guide to taking your
relationship to the next level.

104
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.120
It worked for Cisco.

105
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.873
Barely worked
for young Ralph Macchio.

106
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.792
No. no. no.
This guy. he's chicken. right?

107
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.394
Even in his
current relationship.

108
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.696
he's too afraid
to tell this girl

109
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.176
- that he's actually Vibe. right?
- I'm actually not afraid.

110
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.032
I'm gonna tell her
when I'm ready.

111
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.520
but it's just hard to navigate

112
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.976
the meta-life.
personal-life balance.

113
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.878
More like chicken-life
balance. hmm?

114
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.416
Man. you're a chicken
personal-life balance.

115
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.557
I can tell her whenever I want.

116
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.056
Well. then tell her
right now. why don't you?

117
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.136
You want me
to tell her right now?

118
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.216
- Yeah.
- I'll tell her right now.

119
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.296
I just got... well. you know.

120
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.536
I have spotty reception
in the elevator.

121
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.560
Come on out and do it.

122
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.016
Well. you know.
I gotta get to work.

123
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.880
- Come on out and do it.
- I gotta get to work.

124
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.277
I just talked to one
of the architects here.

125
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.953
and G. Simone & Associates
used to do

126
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.679
all of this high-profile
design work...

127
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.911
casinos. banks.
military bases...

128
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.799
but apparently. last year.
they had been working

129
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.155
with an anonymous client.

130
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.118
So because our thief
covered his tracks.

131
00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.919
we have no idea
who that client might be.

132
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.559
Hey.

133
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.518
Look at this.

134
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.239
Look at these hard drives.

135
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.074
Fried from the inside.
like in a massive power surge.

136
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.256
A server like this would
have a surge protector. right?

137
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.078
A typical
metal-oxide varistor

138
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.072
protects against
a thousand joules.

139
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.231
How many joules does
a lightning bolt have?

140
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.356
A billion.

141
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.635
What. you think
this was Nora?

142
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.074
No. this couldn't have been.

143
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.913
I mean. our scanners
would've picked her up.

144
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.799
Yeah. about that...
I just picked up a frak-ton

145
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.473
of background
particle radiation.

146
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.359
Particles?
Tachyons?

147
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.440
Negative tachyons.

148
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.749
That's a thing?

149
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.910
I mean. negative tachyons

150
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.176
can't generate
lightning. right?

151
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.759
Unless negative tachyons

152
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.514
don't just offset positive ones
like we thought.

153
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.434
Maybe they actually
siphon positive tachyons.

154
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.196
Stealing speed from the
Speed Force like a parasite?

155
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.039
That's what Thawne
taught her how to do.

156
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.158
She's using negative tachyons
to run and avoid our scanners.

157
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.357
Yeah. but why would Nora
be trying to avoid us?

158
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.591
I don't know. but if
she's stealing blueprints.

159
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.434
this ain't gonna be
her last stop.

160
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.040
Pretty paint job.

161
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.635
Predators know
these colors get you stung.

162
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.712
Yeah. it's always
a great idea

163
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.400
for a thief to draw
attention to herself.

164
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.393
At least I don't fly around
in a fuzzy green sweater.

165
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.757
Didn't think I'd recognize
Weather Wizard's kid?

166
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.799
It's Weather Witch.
I have a name. okay?

167
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.916
Bug-Eyed Bandit.

168
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.720
Don't call me that.
That's their name.

169
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.235
I heard you took your
robot bee act to Star City.

170
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.437
Something about
curing a spinal tumor?

171
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.558
Well. I heard you and your
other half were in Bolivia.

172
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.712
Or did Silver Ghost ditch you?

173
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.314
Van Zandt talked a big game.

174
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.312
She tried to recruit me too.

175
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.754
What did she want to call us?

176
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.840
Young...

177
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.033
Rag Doll. right?

178
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.271
You blew up
the Seaver Building.

179
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.033
Bee-utiful.

180
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.916
And whom do I thank
for my mysterious invitation?

181
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.431
Wait. I got
an anonymous offer too.

182
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.635
This wasn't your job?

183
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.154
I thought this was your job.

184
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.278
Actually. I invited you.

185
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.955
You want us to work for you?

186
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.794
Not for me.
With me.

187
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.951
One big score split four ways.

188
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.918
What's the catch.
goody two shoes?

189
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.914
No catches. no tricks.
Just one condition.

190
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.229
No killing.

191
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.231
Well. this has been
really fun. guys. I'm out.

192
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.437
If anybody dies.
the cops will be all over us.

193
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.830
Yeah.
you would love that. huh?

194
00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.656
I'm just surprised that the Flash
isn't already here.

195
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.114
I'm not working
with him anymore.

196
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.520
Look. you can
put on your leather

197
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.336
and you can act like
a bad girl all you want.

198
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.158
but you will never
be one of us.

199
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.118
What about the ice patch?

200
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.236
If you don't trust me.

201
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.520
why did you stop that test car

202
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.472
from running me over?

203
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.358
Is she for real?

204
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.352
It was cold.

205
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.440
Water freezes.

206
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.637
Not like that. it doesn't.

207
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.919
Look. these past few months.
I have been through a lot.

208
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.673
I'm not the same person I was.

209
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.956
Okay. Prove it.

210
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.315
What's the job?

211
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.400
McCulloch Technologies.

212
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.272
It's the largest manufacturer

213
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.113
of military-grade weapons
in the country.

214
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.078
So why does a speedster
need our help

215
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.833
to pull off a smash-and-grab?

216
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.355
McCulloch builds and tests
all of their weapons here.

217
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.079
The Forge.

218
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.992
And it's protected
by a meta-human dampener

219
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.958
that makes A.R.G.U.S.'
look like a bug zapper.

220
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.875
So. you need us for our tech.
because it won't be affected.

221
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.917
McCulloch's hosting
an expo tonight.

222
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.878
That'll give us cover
to get on the property.

223
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.759
but breaking into the Forge
is where things get tricky.

224
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.309
There's no way this score
is worth the risk.

225
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.960
Look. See these weapons?

226
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.475
There's a hundred more
like these inside.

227
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.394
Each will go for a million
on the black market. easy.

228
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.554
We just need to make
one quick pit stop first.

229
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.996
We need to rob the Flash.

230
00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.110
Okay. pretty safe bet
She-Cada was here.

231
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.475
Better check it out.

232
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.080
See if we can figure out
what she took.

233
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.471
Yeah. that is if I can get my
fingers to start moving again.

234
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.994
Whew.

235
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.914
You think there's any chance
Frost could help us out

236
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.071
with some sealant up there?

237
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.675
I don't think
she's coming out today.

238
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.991
She still having a tough time
with your dad's death?

239
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.436
I mean. Frost protected me
for so long

240
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.989
that I don't think she's ever
felt pain of her own before.

241
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.196
not like this.

242
00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.000
Well. I-I think I could
help with that.

243
00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.638
Here.

244
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.509
"Ralph's 27 Steps
to a Better Mourning"?

245
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.920
I don't think
Frost would respond

246
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.195
very well to a pamphlet.

247
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.999
Oh. come on. Look.

248
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.390
Uh. number 10:
go see your dentist because

249
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.936
you should be doing that
at least twice a year

250
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.110
and you've been slacking.

251
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.296
and it'll give
you something to do

252
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.879
other than dwell on the pain.

253
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.792
There.
Now will you shut up?

254
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.753
Told you I'd get her
to come out.

255
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.996
Guess what?

256
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.515
G. Simone & Associates
has spent the last year

257
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.592
working for
McCulloch Technologies.

258
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.796
The weapons manufacturer?

259
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.880
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

260
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.416
They just built
a factory in Keystone.

261
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.593
Missing blueprints.
Top-secret facility.

262
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.957
I think we might have
a heist on our hands.

263
00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.656
You think Nora's
going after these weapons?

264
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.536
No. maybe she's just trying
to get them off the market.

265
00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.472
You know. like the time
that Barry and Ralph

266
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.776
were gonna buy
the Toastmasters.

267
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.679
No. she's on a mission
for Thawne.

268
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.513
He doesn't think that small.

269
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.637
Hey. Barry is scanning
for negative tachyons.

270
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.989
Why don't you and I dig

271
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.992
into what kind of weapons
McCulloch is making?

272
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.231
I know this whistleblower
down at the DOD.

273
00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.456
Maybe she could offer
some insight.

274
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.994
Uh...

275
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.870
Iris. are you sure
there isn't anything else

276
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.280
you'd like to talk about?

277
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.590
Look...
when I saw Nora in 2049.

278
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.593
she was so upset and so angry.

279
00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.037
but she knew
that I wanted to bring her back.

280
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.600
Then she comes back
to this time

281
00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.160
and... and she doesn't even
come home?

282
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.714
I mean. even if
she's mad at Barry

283
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.396
or she wanted
some kind of sci-fi weapon...

284
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.040
Then why didn't she just come
to the rest of us for help?

285
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.871
There's gotta be
a good reason.

286
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.797
I know it.

287
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.680
Come on. Nora.

288
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.470
She's avoiding us.
She's stealing blueprints.

289
00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.870
I mean. she could really
get into trouble out there.

290
00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.316
But do you think she'll return
if you do find her?

291
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.710
After all. she has good reason
to be angry at all of us.

292
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.156
All... what?
Don't lump me in with you two.

293
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.640
I was pissed.
She was pissed.

294
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.758
But we've both had time
to... get over it.

295
00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.160
and she's still Nora.

296
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.879
If I tell her
she can come home again.

297
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.719
I'm sure she'll stop
working with Thawne.

298
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.030
Is that Nora?

299
00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.190
It has to be.

300
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.794
She's in the Starchives.

301
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.632
Nora.

302
00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.635
Hi. Dad.

303
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.552
Hey. where you going?

304
00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.154
Nora is my responsibility
as well.

305
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.511
I must speak with her.

306
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.954
Hey. hold that!

307
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.800
One of our motion sensors

308
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.111
just got tripped
in the sewage system.

309
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.554
Sewage system?

310
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.154
<i>Mais non.</i>
Nobody could fit down there.

311
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.230
Is that
Spencer Young's phone?

312
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.039
What are you doing?

313
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.679
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

314
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.433
Nora...

315
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.471
I shouldn't have left things
the way that I did.

316
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.960
All right?

317
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.955
I want you to come home.

318
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.313
We all do.

319
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.357
You just have to stop
working with Thawne.

320
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.393
<i>Target acquired.</i>

321
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.392
Copy that.

322
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.517
Are you talking to someone?

323
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.434
What do you think.
I'm talking to Thawne?

324
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.751
He's in the future. Dad.
I can't exactly call him up.

325
00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.194
I didn't say that.

326
00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.616
Yeah. but you did say
that I couldn't come home

327
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.199
if I was still working
with him.

328
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.634
- You still don't trust me.
- Nora. trust takes time.

329
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.791
Then what's to stop you
from sending me back

330
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.031
the next time
you get pissed at me?

331
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.395
Nothing.

332
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.791
Because you've given up
on me again.

333
00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.837
Given up on me
like you do

334
00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.276
every time!

335
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.589
Nora. what are you doing?

336
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.878
You know. I came back here
to meet you.

337
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.754
And the second I got here.
you started pushing me away.

338
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.196
And then you left me
in the future.

339
00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.237
You just dumped me
in the middle of the street

340
00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.549
and walked away!

341
00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.835
You have to stop.

342
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.720
And you didn't come with Mom
to bring me back.

343
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.510
Because you don't want me here.
You don't want me at all!

344
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.994
- Nora. please!
- I hate you!

345
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.114
Nora broke into
the Starchives.

346
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.357
I'm sorry. what happened?

347
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.796
Nora broke into
the Starchives.

348
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.997
I thought I could stop her.
but I couldn't.

349
00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.296
She stole
Spencer Young's phone.

350
00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.198
Spencer Young's
hypnotizing phone?

351
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.033
- Yes.
- Barry. it's okay.

352
00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.800
Did you at least find out
what she's doing?

353
00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.400
No. no. I tried.

354
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.995
I-I thought I could convince
her to come home.

355
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.400
But...

356
00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.075
her face started vibrating.
and...

357
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.436
and then her eyes. and...

358
00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.876
her lightning...

359
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.952
it was red.

360
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.633
Just like his.

361
00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.279
I thought we had time
to reach her.

362
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.360
but he got to her.

363
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.914
Thawne really got to her.

364
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.480
Uh. guys.

365
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.632
there's a blinky red light
thing on the computer.

366
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.316
Another alarm went off
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

367
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.232
Guys. this was only
five minutes ago.

368
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.198
Joss Jackam and Peter Merkel?

369
00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.656
How would they get
into S.T.A.R. Labs?

370
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.592
Nora had someone in her ear.

371
00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.593
It was a coordinated assault.

372
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.320
But that would mean
that she's working...

373
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.470
with them.

374
00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.040
Barium.

375
00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.349
We're in Keystone City.

376
00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.399
Well. we got a Rag Doll.

377
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.234
a Weather Witch. and. uh...

378
00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.960
hold up. is that
crazy bee girl?

379
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.793
Hey. girl!
What's going on?

380
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.397
What a throwback.

381
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.709
What the hell
is he doing here?

382
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.076
What the hell
are you doing here?

383
00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.799
Oh. no.

384
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.394
She's with them.

385
00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.711
I said I wanted Ramon.
No one else.

386
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.075
Yeah. well.
they were together.

387
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.311
and you said no killing.
so here they are.

388
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.880
Killing?

389
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.231
This phone was synced
to Spencer Young's DNA.

390
00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.680
We need you to hack past the
coding so we're able to use it.

391
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.230
Why are you laughing?

392
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.993
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to blow up

393
00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.912
your spot. fangirl.
you see. it's just. um...

394
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.118
I've done this exact
same thing before.

395
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.876
We need to hack a weapon.
Let's kidnap Cisco.

396
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.475
I mean. what. did you join a
Rogues cover band or something?

397
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.678
How's this for a cover band?

398
00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.271
Oldie but a goodie.

399
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.559
Look. XS.
I owe you an apology. hmm?

400
00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.791
Never should've exposed
your secret the way I did.

401
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.873
I put my pride in front
of the family that took me in...

402
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.271
your family...
and your family loves you.

403
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.510
I'm sure you heard.

404
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.512
Your father told you
as much today. right?

405
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.273
You saw your father?

406
00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.920
You said you were robbing
the Flash.

407
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.754
- No.
- No. don't you get it?

408
00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.832
Her old man is the Flash.

409
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.834
Look. you don't have to worry
about the Flash. okay?

410
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.913
Just get Ramon started
on that phone.

411
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.754
Hey.

412
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.036
Boot scuff marks.

413
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.674
I'm thinking
she hit this thing.

414
00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.479
Yeah.

415
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.991
Intravenous electrolytes.

416
00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.231
I mean. those can be used
to treat coma patients.

417
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.915
So maybe she grabbed them
for Grace Junior.

418
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.354
Hell yeah.

419
00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.150
I knew your <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>
thing would come in handy.

420
00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.880
Ralph. why did you
really bring me here?

421
00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.714
Was it to help
Killer Frost and me?

422
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.315
The same way you helped
Cisco get over Gypsy

423
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.472
and Sherloque with Renee?

424
00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.029
What are you talking about?
I mean. we're a team.

425
00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.376
It's what we do.
We help each other.

426
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.336
Yeah. but the minute you
got the Book of Ralph back

427
00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.353
from Cisco. you tried
to give it away again.

428
00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.715
Don't you want to use it?

429
00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.156
Try and find someone
special for yourself?

430
00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.432
Caitlin...

431
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.079
look...

432
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.311
Book of Ralph...

433
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.790
works great
for other people. but...

434
00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.316
never actually worked for me.

435
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.031
I know I'm not...

436
00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.271
built for love.

437
00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.673
And that's okay.

438
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.871
Ralph Dibny. you are kind.
intelligent. and compassionate.

439
00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:54.996
And most of all.

440
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.278
you put the needs
of others before yourself.

441
00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.036
So that means
you are built for love.

442
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.834
and you deserve someone
who loves you back.

443
00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.111
Caitlin...

444
00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.277
I'm sorry. I just don't
feel that way about you.

445
00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.636
Ugh. Gross!

446
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.433
Oh. come on. you idiot.

447
00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.160
Sorry. I got my...
I got my wires crossed.

448
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.197
Jeez.

449
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.556
Hey...

450
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.960
I think this might be
the fridge

451
00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.554
that Cisco was
telling me about.

452
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.200
the one that he rewired
as an incubator.

453
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.518
And now the top shelf is empty.

454
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.512
Okay. what was on
the top shelf?

455
00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:44.276
Cisco's prototypes
for the meta-human cure.

456
00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.034
I think I know
what Cicada is planning.

457
00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.998
Last time a group of women

458
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.434
had me tied up like this...

459
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.273
They were your ex-wives?

460
00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.874
No. their attorneys.
actually.

461
00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.191
Am I gonna end up like you?

462
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.634
Married to the job?

463
00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.433
Keeping secrets
from everyone I know?

464
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.352
Well. actually.
in my current romance.

465
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.999
I'm not the one
keeping secrets.

466
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.958
No. no.
I meet Renee Aldler...

467
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.033
- Adler...
- And then I discover...

468
00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.077
she's a meta-human.

469
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.349
And she hasn't told you yet?

470
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.113
No. monsieur.
Can you believe that?

471
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.999
So if you know the truth.
and you're bottling it in.

472
00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.676
doesn't that mean you're
kind of being dishonest?

473
00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.999
Chicken recognize chicken.

474
00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.315
Hmm.

475
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.153
And yet. are you
really a chicken...

476
00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.833
Monsieur Bawk?

477
00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.158
Or are you not sharing your
secret identity with Kamala...

478
00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.993
- Kamilla.
- Because...

479
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.835
you're not super-satisfied
with your secret identity?

480
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.117
Are you saying
I don't want to be Vibe?

481
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.079
Well. let's examine
the evidence. shall we?

482
00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.073
You spent this past year
sans powers for the first part.

483
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.675
and the second part
curing powers.

484
00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.513
Perhaps being honest
with Kamala...

485
00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.829
Kamilla.

486
00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.416
Begins with being honest
with yourself.

487
00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.999
Think about that.

488
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.911
So what we know is that
Nora put together a team

489
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.676
to break into here.
McCulloch Technologies.

490
00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.114
a weapons manufacturer.

491
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.476
But not just any weapons.

492
00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.360
The city has contracted
these guys to clean up

493
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.240
the shrapnel from
the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite.

494
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.456
Let me guess:
None of that crap

495
00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.073
ended up in the dump.

496
00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.994
They used it to make meta-tech
like Spencer Young's phone.

497
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.436
My source says
that McCulloch is debuting

498
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.194
a new line of products tonight.

499
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.352
That's a perfect cover-up
for a break-in.

500
00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.159
We have any theory
on Nora's motive?

501
00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.994
Actually. Cicada's dagger
dampens the abilities

502
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.639
of meta-humans nearby.

503
00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.951
but it wouldn't have
any effect on meta-tech.

504
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.397
So maybe Nora wants
to catch Cicada?

505
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.437
Or do something worse.

506
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.955
Barry. there's no way.

507
00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.555
This is exactly
what I was afraid of. Iris.

508
00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.233
Thawne's been manipulating her.

509
00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.710
Now she's acting like him.
talking like him.

510
00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.996
That doesn't mean that she's
capable of killing Cicada.

511
00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.480
She's working with Rogues.

512
00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.119
She kidnapped Cisco
and Sherloque.

513
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.396
We don't know
what she's capable of.

514
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.472
So what do you want
to do. Barr?

515
00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.710
We bring her in.

516
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.120
We use Cisco's force fields.

517
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.078
Ray's nanites...
we're bringing her in.

518
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.470
before she steps
anywhere near that building.

519
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.876
Hey. Barry.
Hold on.

520
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.360
Hey.

521
00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.358
We can't keep treating Nora

522
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.096
like she's some kind
of super-villain. okay?

523
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.296
- We're just gonna push her away.
- What are we supposed to do?

524
00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.776
Just let her keep
taking advantage of us?

525
00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.031
No.
We see where she's coming from.

526
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.696
We try to figure out
why she's doing this.

527
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.473
It doesn't matter why. Iris!

528
00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:31.960
This is Thawne.

529
00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.235
It's his plan.

530
00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.834
Well. maybe his plan
isn't so bad.

531
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.029
What?

532
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.995
Maybe...

533
00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.150
I thought...

534
00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.914
I thought we were
past this. it's...

535
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.040
it's not okay for her
to work with Thawne.

536
00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.237
You saw him.
You said he's manipulating her.

537
00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.680
And I said
that he cares about her.

538
00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.000
He's worried about her safety...

539
00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.276
No. he needs her. Iris.
He needs her.

540
00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.751
Or... he's changed.

541
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.390
Barry. Thawne is the one that
convinced me to come back home

542
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.472
and try and patch
things up with you.

543
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.639
Thawne.

544
00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.954
Thawne gave you advice?

545
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.474
Look. I know
it sounds insane.

546
00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.712
and I know this must be
hard for you to hear.

547
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.678
but. Barry.
ever since I got back home.

548
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.197
the same question
keeps running through my mind.

549
00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.397
What if Nora is right?

550
00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.995
What if Thawne really is
trying to redeem himself

551
00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.560
and that he does want
to stop Cicada

552
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.680
and the only reason
that Nora hasn't come back home

553
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.679
is because she knows
that you don't trust her?

554
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.520
Look...

555
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.195
Barry. having Nora in our lives

556
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.840
has made us better people.

557
00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.957
Isn't it possible

558
00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.271
that she did the same thing
to Thawne?

559
00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.877
Jenni Ognats?

560
00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.997
I thought the idea
was to not draw attention.

561
00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.536
Oh. what. so now that you
know my dad's the Flash.

562
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.789
you don't trust me?

563
00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.872
Hey. you're the one
who doesn't trust us.

564
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.633
Isn't that right...

565
00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.439
Nora?

566
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.998
Yeah. your secret identity.
it's really not worth much.

567
00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.151
Feels like nothing about me
is worth much lately.

568
00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.755
My dad left me.

569
00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:44.039
after everything that I've done
to try and help him.

570
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.796
You know what the most
embarrassing part is?

571
00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.389
There's this tiny. little.
weak part of me

572
00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.790
that still wants him
to walk through that door

573
00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.030
and take me home.

574
00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:04.551
My dad left my mom
at the maternity ward.

575
00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.913
She couldn't look at me
without seeing him.

576
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.151
She made sure I knew it too.

577
00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.278
So the day I turned 13. I ran.

578
00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.874
I didn't leave town at first.

579
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.271
I stayed under the overpass
with all the other runaways.

580
00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.319
And I thought for sure.

581
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.312
one night. I'd look up

582
00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.754
and I'd see my mom.

583
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.154
She never showed.

584
00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.070
- Sorry.
- I'm not.

585
00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.958
When people tell you that

586
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.919
family is always
gonna be there for you.

587
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.229
they're full of it.

588
00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.593
Mentors will always
let you down eventually.

589
00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.956
Parents will break you.

590
00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.633
Yeah.

591
00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.996
That's why we
have to stick together.

592
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.193
- Yeah.
<i>- Hey. it's done.</i>

593
00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.357
Come on.
Nerd's done with the phone.

594
00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.913
One reprogrammed
meta-tech phone.

595
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.471
now with visual and auditory
hypnosis capabilities.

596
00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.112
Plus unlimited data.

597
00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.796
You gonna let us go now?

598
00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.758
What. so you can run
right back to the Flash?

599
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.753
How stupid do you think I am?

600
00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.035
Any bugs in there?

601
00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.952
- It's clean.
- Good.

602
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.600
Now make sure
they can't try anything else.

603
00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:37.749
Come on.

604
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.911
This score's not
gonna steal itself.

605
00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.936
<i>You're not gonna
get away with this.</i>

606
00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.189
Hey.

607
00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.376
<i>I'm not gonna get away
with it?</i>

608
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.392
Cisco's old speedster trap.

609
00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.358
You think that's gonna
work for Nora?

610
00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.920
I don't know.

611
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.357
I'm not sure I'm ready
to find out. though.

612
00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.194
Hey. look. I'm sorry
about. um...

613
00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.512
how I was acting earlier.
I just...

614
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.796
seeing Nora
looking so much like him...

615
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.031
No. I get it. Barr.

616
00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.998
That guy's always
gonna be in your head.

617
00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.719
Mine too.

618
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.553
And you were right.

619
00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.359
Nora broke the law.

620
00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.716
And there should be
repercussions for that.

621
00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:27.360
But whenever you guys
step out of bounds.

622
00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.557
I always have to
remind myself.

623
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.109
the detective side says
there's the law.

624
00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:37.233
But the father side says
there's also what's right.

625
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:43.032
And... I'm always gonna choose
to be your father first.

626
00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.790
Maybe that's my problem.

627
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.234
What?

628
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.998
I was ready
to give up on her.

629
00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:58.232
You know? I mean.
If I'm ready to do that.

630
00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.999
it makes me feel like

631
00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.390
even after everything
we've been through.

632
00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.233
I'm not a good parent.

633
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.856
You know. I mean.
maybe I never will be.

634
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.520
Come on. Barry.
You know that's not true.

635
00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.638
You're going to be
an amazing father.

636
00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.235
I wanted her to leave.

637
00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.314
The second that she got here.
I did. I...

638
00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.471
I've held back from her.

639
00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.473
It still doesn't feel right
when she calls me Dad.

640
00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:27.713
Well. you didn't
call me Dad till...

641
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.678
it was here. in this room.

642
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.229
right after you got
your powers.

643
00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.312
But you know why that was.

644
00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.150
You already had a dad.
Henry.

645
00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.616
And when the whole world
thought that

646
00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.792
that man was a criminal.
Barr. you...

647
00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.359
You thought he was perfect.

648
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.954
Do you think Iris is right?

649
00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:56.519
Nora's plan. Thawne's plan...

650
00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.080
could be a good thing?

651
00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.833
I don't trust that man.

652
00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.238
I never have and I never will.

653
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.349
But I do...

654
00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.114
trust my granddaughter.

655
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.317
And if we're gonna
bring Nora home. Barr...

656
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.320
you're gonna have
to trust her too.

657
00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.280
Oh. thank Crom.

658
00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.317
I might've given you
unlimited data.

659
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.278
but I also gave you
spotty reception.

660
00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.714
Nice work.

661
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.216
All right.
The bees are in drone mode.

662
00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.278
So if we move very.
very slowly...

663
00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.033
Man. what in the world?

664
00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.236
What?

665
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.720
I was trained
in the art of escape

666
00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.320
by Thaddeus Brown
from Earth-51.

667
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.993
Yeah. well. help me escape!

668
00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.958
That's a good plan.
All right.

669
00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.440
So. um...

670
00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.318
- Count backwards from ten.
- Ten...

671
00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.400
Ow!

672
00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.755
How did you do that?

673
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.910
- Trade secret.
- Okay.

674
00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.954
So...

675
00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.840
You're not fireproof.
are you. Monsieur Ramon?

676
00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.513
Am I fire...
oh. God.

677
00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.910
Oh.

678
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.593
Ah.

679
00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.680
No. no.

680
00:30:05.681 --> 00:30:06.955
Hey!

681
00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.436
That's all of them?

682
00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.000
- I think so.
- Good.

683
00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.799
Because Nora West-Allen
is in grave danger.

684
00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.216
Thank you for your patience.
ladies and gentlemen.

685
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.039
With the kind of technology
we're displaying tonight.

686
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.919
security is our
highest priority.

687
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.116
Visitor IDs. please.

688
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.793
You bet.

689
00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.557
Okay. here we go.
Right this way. ladies.

690
00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.074
The last ten months have been

691
00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.958
very exciting
here at McCulloch.

692
00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.993
Buyers from the Army and Navy
are already waiting for us

693
00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.639
in our state-of-the-art
demo room.

694
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.632
Uh. what's behind that door?

695
00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.000
Ah.

696
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.960
That's what our engineers
have dubbed the Forge.

697
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.560
It's where we develop and test
our new weapons.

698
00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.200
Unfortunately. it's only
accessible to employees

699
00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:15.000
with the highest
security clearance.

700
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.714
Remember.

701
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.120
No killing.

702
00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:33.034
That's a Montgomery 4000.
30-ton vault door.

703
00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.879
It'll only open
from the inside.

704
00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.158
so the only way into the Forge
is through there.

705
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.755
Mm. cozy.

706
00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.638
Ready. clown?

707
00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.436
Are you sure you can fit
through that thing?

708
00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:20.072
This shall be my aria.

709
00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.616
Remember. once you get
to the other side.

710
00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.518
the dampener will take away
your powers.

711
00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.956
so get out quick.

712
00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.350
Yeah. I'm gonna vomit.

713
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.159
Mm. mm. mm...

714
00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.997
Open sesame.

715
00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:57.559
Stay with the hostages.
We'll grab you on the way out.

716
00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.394
See you soon.

717
00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.320
That's one serious
meta-dampener.

718
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.793
Whoa.

719
00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.993
Last part of the plan.

720
00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.914
Load up.

721
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.435
Sorry. XS.

722
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.159
Change of plans.

723
00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.556
Good evening. Central City.

724
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.597
We've prepared
a special show for you.

725
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.034
Tonight's festivities

726
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:48.080
will feature several
expendable worker bees...

727
00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.949
the employees
of McCulloch Technologies.

728
00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.316
Unless the Flash comes down
here in the next 30 seconds

729
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.232
and reveals his identity
to the world.

730
00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.470
Gucci?

731
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.270
You don't want the money?

732
00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.880
Oh. no.
We want the money.

733
00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.920
We just wanted to make
a name for ourselves first.

734
00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:10.113
So. what. outing my dad makes
you legitimate Rogues?

735
00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.200
I trusted you.

736
00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.630
Oh. God.

737
00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.712
You sound just like
Silver Ghost...

738
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.440
when I left her in Bolivia.

739
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.830
At least you'll die fast.

740
00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.639
I'd say it's been
about 30 seconds. right?

741
00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:25.313
- Yeah.
- Right?

742
00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.031
Okay.

743
00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.157
Wait!

744
00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.956
I am here.

745
00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.759
All right. Speedy.

746
00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.230
Show us your true identity.
Mask off.

747
00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.616
Dad. please.
You do not have to do this.

748
00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.359
I have to.

749
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:46.992
I am a man sitting alone
at the dinner table.

750
00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.595
Is he drunk?

751
00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.196
See. when you're in position

752
00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.074
to feed the world.

753
00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.516
it can make it hard
to be a father.

754
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.478
You have to constantly
ask yourself.

755
00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.600
is what's right for the world
what's right for your child?

756
00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.957
- Hey. can we get on with it?
- Yes. um... yeah. uh...

757
00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.713
- No.
- What?

758
00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.395
Did you seriously think I was
gonna fall for this again?

759
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.754
Ha!

760
00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.479
I phase right through
your blast.

761
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.040
Ha! You can't stop
the Flash!

762
00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.351
No. I think the jig is up.

763
00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.715
Confused?

764
00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.553
Don't be.

765
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.800
Holy shrap.

766
00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.439
How the hell
is this even possible?

767
00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.636
We bypassed security

768
00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.976
while you were busy
with General Cloud.

769
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.310
And then you walked
us worker bees right inside.

770
00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.871
You're outnumbered. ladies.
Drop your weapons.

771
00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.554
Don't let them
hit that dampener.

772
00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.800
Get the hostages out of here.

773
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.200
We'll handle the Rogues.

774
00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.760
This way. This way.

775
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.469
- We gotta get back in there.
- Yeah.

776
00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:05.638
What the hell is that?

777
00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.359
You don't want to know.

778
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.393
Cisco. we need
our powers back.

779
00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.896
Can you do something
about these bees?

780
00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.479
Hold tight.

781
00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.040
Iris!

782
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.560
All right. we're not gonna
last here much longer.

783
00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.856
I'm gonna create a diversion.
Get ready to shoot the dampener.

784
00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.314
No. no.
Dad. it's too dangerous!

785
00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:49.830
Dad!

786
00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.195
He's lucky I don't throw
his ass off a roof.

787
00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.754
Nobody out-techs me.

788
00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.153
Damn it.
Ramon's in my phone.

789
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.836
She's not getting out
of this one alive.

790
00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.077
Nora. wait!

791
00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.916
Dad! You've been hit.

792
00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:32.351
Are you okay?

793
00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.636
Yeah.

794
00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.916
I'm not the only one.

795
00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.799
You were here with me.

796
00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.200
The whole time.

797
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.754
I abandoned you once.

798
00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.593
I'm never gonna do it again.

799
00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.791
So we should probably...

800
00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:52.314
Oh. yeah.
Definitely.

801
00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.399
The young Rogues.

802
00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.631
Not the nicest friends
you made there. kiddo.

803
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:14.272
Yeah. I... thought
I could control them.

804
00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.352
steal the weapons back
after we lifted them.

805
00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.075
but I got in over my head.

806
00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:20.594
Even if it was
for a good reason.

807
00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.673
Nora. killing Cicada
is not a good reason.

808
00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:26.229
No. I-I wasn't trying
to kill Cicada.

809
00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.996
I needed this.

810
00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.390
It's a weapon built
from the solar reflector panels

811
00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.153
from the S.T.A.R. Labs
satellite.

812
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.438
capable of destroying
any object down to its atoms.

813
00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:47.514
and it's the only thing that
can destroy Cicada's dagger.

814
00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:51.916
Nora. why didn't you
just tell us this?

815
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.435
Because I wouldn't
have believed her.

816
00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.552
'Cause it's Thawne's plan.

817
00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.836
I knew how angry Dad was.

818
00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.072
And then you came
to the future without him.

819
00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.834
I just thought
he'd never believe me.

820
00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.355
Plus. I had to stay in
a seriously unschway headspace

821
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.797
to use the negative
Speed Force.

822
00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.431
But I know now.

823
00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.830
I don't ever want to leave
you guys again.

824
00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.913
And if that means not following
through with Thawne's plan.

825
00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.952
I'm okay with that.

826
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.271
I think we should use it.

827
00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.239
- You what?
- Barr. are you sure?

828
00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.754
We have to stop Cicada.

829
00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.514
I'm never gonna like
where this plan comes from.

830
00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.599
But if this thing works...

831
00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.911
sounds like our best shot.

832
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.037
You really believe him?

833
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.469
I believe in you. Nora.

834
00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.716
And I'm sorry
that I made you feel otherwise.

835
00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.153
Dad...

836
00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.336
that stuff I said earlier...

837
00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.511
I deserved it.

838
00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.557
I-I...

839
00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:02.599
I shouldn't have left you
in the future.

840
00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.833
I shouldn't have put
conditions on you coming home.

841
00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:08.957
I'm sorry.

842
00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:12.033
I love you.

843
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.516
We both do.

844
00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.235
We're never gonna
leave you again. Nora.

845
00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.118
We promise.

846
00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.000
So what's the verdict?

847
00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.400
Nora's story checks out.

848
00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.676
This thing has got
a prismatic battery

849
00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.717
supercharging
its reflector panels.

850
00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.110
So if anything's gonna
destroy that dagger.

851
00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:42.113
it's this mirror gun.

852
00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.759
That may be easier said
than done.

853
00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.240
Why's that?

854
00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.976
We figured out what Cicada
took from my dad's lab.

855
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.196
It's your cure prototypes.

856
00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.272
Why would she need those?
They're just prototypes.

857
00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.760
No. they're not
just prototypes.

858
00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.992
They're failed.
broken versions of the cure.

859
00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.595
If a meta-human takes that
without the proper treatment...

860
00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.353
They would die.

861
00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:02.875
Cicada has a lethal virus
on her hands.

862
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.440
That's why she stole
the atomizer.

863
00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:05.954
So she can spread the virus.

864
00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.997
She has weaponized the cure.

865
00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.230
This is it.

866
00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.473
This is the nightmare.

867
00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:16.349
Cicada's gonna kill
every meta-human in the city.

868
00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:31.510
A rare. old bird
is the pelican.

869
00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:36.277
whose beak can hold more
than his belly can.

870
00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:40.759
He can hold in his beak...

871
00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:45.232
enough food for a week.
But I'm...

872
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.437
Darned...

873
00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:51.872
if I know...

874
00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:55.431
how the hell he can.

875
00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.634
<i>Greg. move your head.</i>
