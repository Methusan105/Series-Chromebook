00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.829
<i>My name is Barry Allen.</i>

2
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.434
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.193
<i>To the outside world.</i>

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.192
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist.</i>

5
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.595
<i>But secretly. with the help</i>

6
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.319
<i>of my friends
at S.T.A.R. Labs.</i>

7
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.856
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans</i>

8
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.200
<i>like me.</i>

9
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.556
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help.</i>

10
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.359
<i>she changed the present</i>

11
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.475
<i>and now our world is
more dangerous than ever</i>

12
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.870
<i>and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

13
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.435
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

14
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.874
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

15
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.960
Save her.

16
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.310
<i>My life is a million times
better than what it was.</i>

17
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.153
<i>and it's all because
of you. Gracie.</i>

18
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.276
Got you some groceries

19
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.656
and some meloxicam
for your injuries.

20
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.114
We call it the cure.

21
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.079
It's a serum that suppresses
dark matter in meta-humans.

22
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.992
You're the first person
to take it.

23
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.640
I think we should offer
the cure to Cicada.

24
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.189
<i>From the journal
of Nora West-Allen:</i>

25
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.511
<i>"The timeline is malleable."</i>

26
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.398
<i>Why is she hiding
this interest?</i>

27
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.994
Tell me you know
what you're doing.

28
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.356
I am the only speedster
who knows what he's doing!

29
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.272
Stick with the plan.

30
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.593
The cure is finished.
and it works.

31
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.875
Now we can use it on Dwyer.

32
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.032
and then his connection
to the dagger will be broken.

33
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.840
What's wrong?

34
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.992
The timeline.

35
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.959
I've charted this timeline
from Anthro the First Boy

36
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.315
to Kamandi the Last.

37
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.840
I know all of it.

38
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.434
I know its crests.
I know its valleys.

39
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.080
I know what we must do
to defeat Cicada.

40
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.358
Or rather. I knew.

41
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.916
This is a photo of the last
public sighting

42
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.150
of the Flash and Cicada.

43
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.560
Their final confrontation.

44
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.280
Dad's last chance to use
the cure on Cicada.

45
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.200
I've been trying to engineer
a moment like this

46
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.376
the whole time I've been there.

47
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.120
Now. watch.

48
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.230
See this?

49
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.474
That is a new timeline
struggling to break through.

50
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.076
manifesting itself
right before our eyes.

51
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.880
Is it a good timeline.
or is it a bad timeline?

52
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.110
That doesn't matter.

53
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.999
What matters is it's new
and. as such. unpredictable.

54
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.073
and we may lose
our window of opportunity.

55
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.278
So we need to find Cicada
before the timeline changes.

56
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.638
Why did it change?

57
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.393
Did I screw something up?

58
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.312
No.

59
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.192
No.

60
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.351
You've done very well.
little runner.

61
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.719
But a new variable is coming.
something big is coming.

62
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.716
Or someone.

63
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.776
<i>Well. it's interesting
that you say that. sir.</i>

64
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.712
since it's your company
that's denying

65
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.837
the Robertson's family's claim.

66
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.470
Yes. of course. I have the
contract right in front of me.

67
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.515
And it says that animal attacks

68
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.398
do not fall under
Acts of God.

69
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.915
and that includes gorillas.

70
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.196
The Citizen looks forward
to your statement.

71
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.954
- Thanks. babe.
- Mm-hmm.

72
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.594
Are you ready
to do this thing now?

73
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.273
Hell yeah.
we just got to find Nora.

74
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.510
It's her big day after all.

75
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.096
You don't think she's too busy.
do you?

76
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.793
Okay. people. think!

77
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.760
We haven't seen Cicada
since the rooftop fight.

78
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.896
which means the only way to
track him down is to figure out

79
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.593
who his next meta-human
target's gonna be.

80
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.911
Have we double checked
every bank robbery.

81
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.514
every lab break-in?

82
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.496
Yes. yes! We have looked
at all of that. all right?

83
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.557
And all the criminals
that are in custody

84
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.279
are simply mere mortals.

85
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.680
What about the ones
on the street?

86
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.216
Frost says that no new metas
have shown up

87
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.640
since Norvock went into witsec.

88
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.791
Are the satellites tracking
for dark matter

89
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.519
or meta-gene bursts
or Element X?

90
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.353
Yes. yes. and yes.

91
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.113
They're scanning
for everything.

92
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.277
Congratulations.
you raised a menace.

93
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.716
Your daughter. so energetic.

94
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.032
This is pretty impressive.

95
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.956
Um. and I... and I know
with the cure working.

96
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.633
we're all ready
to put Cicada to rest.

97
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.473
but I'm sure
he'll resurface soon.

98
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.736
And then you're going
to give him the chance

99
00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.080
to take the meta-human cure?

100
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.310
Yes. exactly.

101
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.631
Even Dwyer deserves a choice.

102
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.536
We just got to convince him
to do the right thing.

103
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.835
Are you ready?

104
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.752
This is gonna be one
of the biggest challenges

105
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.120
of your career as a hero.

106
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.416
Do you know what
you're going to say?

107
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.792
Oh. yeah... you know. yeah.

108
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.396
I've... I've got
some loose thoughts.

109
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.480
Oh. great.

110
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.456
Well. that instills all of us
with confidence. right?

111
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.358
Loose thoughts?
What are you going to say?

112
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.352
"Hey. most bloodthirsty enemy!
Stop."

113
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.910
Guys. it worked for Marlize.

114
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.157
Maybe not so much
for Savitar. but...

115
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.391
I will figure out what to say
to him. all right?

116
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.516
I got this.

117
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.875
I know you do. Dad.

118
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.998
Which is why we need to try
everything to try and find him.

119
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.080
Okay?

120
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.440
Maybe we should go on patrol?

121
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.398
Patrol. you say?
What this is. World War Il?

122
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.359
Oh. wow.
Wow. this is crazy.

123
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.080
There is something nuts
going on at Jitters.

124
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.496
- Do you think it's a meta-human?
- Probably.

125
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.954
It might be.

126
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.111
- We should check it out.
- Yeah.

127
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.429
- For sure.
- Yeah.

128
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.670
Yeah. Go.

129
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.959
- You two did this.
- You made her.

130
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.040
You are responsible.

131
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.800
Well. well. well.

132
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.873
It is nice to see someone
back at his desk

133
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.599
Oh. hey. Foxy.

134
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.680
It's good to be back.

135
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.998
After three months of sipping
Wally's Tibetan butter tea.

136
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.879
I actually kind of missed
this break room coffee.

137
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.077
Ugh. Uh-uh.

138
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.936
Hey. you got any idea
where I can get my hands

139
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.440
on the Cicada task force file?

140
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.199
Babe. you're standing in it.

141
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.873
What?

142
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.270
I've been trying to catch up
on what I've been missing.

143
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.400
Oh.

144
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.631
Uh. speaking of which...

145
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.200
you ever seen this woman?

146
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.119
Uh. Dr. Vanessa Ambres.

147
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.720
Born and raised
in Central City.

148
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.951
got her MD from McNider U.

149
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.719
Oh. that's interesting.

150
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.076
This says she treated
Orlin Dwyer and Grace Gibbons

151
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.296
on the night
of the Enlightenment.

152
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.358
Yes. and she has been
treating Grace ever since.

153
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.238
even though
she's an ER doctor.

154
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.471
and the nurses report
a whole slew of drugs

155
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.755
missing from the coma ward.

156
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.150
You think
she's working with Dwyer?

157
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.118
The guy got stabbed.
struck by lightning.

158
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.839
He's got a hole in his chest.

159
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.296
Somebody has got
to be patching him up. right?

160
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.710
I think we should be asking
the doctor a few questions.

161
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.792
All right. let's do it.

162
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.673
Oh. you want to come with?

163
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.433
Yeah. I want to come with.
What?

164
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.000
Uh. yeah. yeah.

165
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.958
- Yeah!
- All right. partner.

166
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.077
- Partner. I like that.
- Yeah.

167
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.395
Okay. I thought something big

168
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.616
was supposed to be
going on down here.

169
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.677
Oh. I don't know.
It's pretty big.

170
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.677
Feast your eyes on the newest
addition to the Jitters menu.

171
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.870
The XS-presso.

172
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.096
I got my own drink!

173
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.191
It's pretty schway. right?

174
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.873
Think of what could be next.

175
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.077
An XS action figure?
XS Day?

176
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.992
Guys.
you are embarrassing me.

177
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.120
We're just really excited.

178
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.396
I mean. we still haven't
even gone on a trip together

179
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.240
or made Grandma Esther's famous
sweet potato pie recipe.

180
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.080
Did you put karaoke
on the list like I asked?

181
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.160
I think so. actually.

182
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.799
Just a sec...
let me see this.

183
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.429
Okay. there are so many things
on this list.

184
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.856
- Mm-hmm.
- Well. I mean. we've got time.

185
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.176
Okay. is that a real alert
or another fake one?

186
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.200
No. this one's real.

187
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.158
M20 at CCU Chemistry Department.

188
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.197
- A meta attack.
- Yeah. let's go. Come on.

189
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.480
Been a while
since high school chem.

190
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.200
but that does not look like
proper lab safety.

191
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.956
I need this!
Leave me alone!

192
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.879
Sodium bicarbonate
neutralizes any acid.

193
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.758
You have the cuffs?

194
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.874
Let's go get him.

195
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.713
- We don't need to.
- What?

196
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.393
Look at this burn mark.

197
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.195
That acid guy. he...
he must've been there

198
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.280
when the photo was taken.

199
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.158
What are you talking about?

200
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.995
Dad. today's the day
you stop Cicada.

201
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.576
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.
Slow down. Say that again?

202
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.796
There's a photo.
it's in The Flash museum.

203
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.111
of Flash and Cicada the last time
they were ever seen

204
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.480
confronting each other
in public.

205
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.079
and in the photo.
by Flash's feet.

206
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.073
the exact same burn mark
left by the meta

207
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.389
that we just fought.

208
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.676
This acid meta
was at their final confrontation?

209
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.752
He must be Cicada's
final target.

210
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.593
His final target
before I vanish

211
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.736
and he starts killing again.

212
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.436
Why you are just telling us
about this crucial meta now?

213
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.797
Because a lot of the stuff
from my timeline

214
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.880
is unreliable.

215
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.536
You know. different metas.
different victims.

216
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.040
different circumstances.

217
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.157
But this time.
everything's exactly the same.

218
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.560
So far.

219
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.632
If Cicada goes
after this acid meta.

220
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.717
that means that today's
the last day

221
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.154
we're going to confront him.

222
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.516
And our last chance
to stop him.

223
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.280
Yeah. all right. well. then.
I gotta figure out exactly

224
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.874
what I'm gonna say to him.

225
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.758
You'll find the words. Dad.
I'll help you.

226
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.196
And I am going to start
working on facial rec

227
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.396
for this Acid Master.

228
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.800
Yup. that's what
I'm going with.

229
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.394
Always trust your gut. kids.

230
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.016
And we'll figure out a way
for you to talk to Cicada

231
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.032
without him killing you.

232
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.752
Well...

233
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.674
if it all works out. then...

234
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.470
looks like today could be
the end of our journey.

235
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.597
Yeah.

236
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.797
And I guess
everyone starts moving on.

237
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.877
- Nora.
- Oh. hey. Mom.

238
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.156
Um. look. I've really gotta
hurry and go help Dad.

239
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.038
Yeah. I know. it's just...

240
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.396
I guess you might be
going home tomorrow.

241
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.318
Yeah. I guess so.
Um. mission accomplished.

242
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.000
Well. if you two need
a break after a while.

243
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.800
Papa Joe taught me the famous
West family right hook.

244
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.519
I-I would love to teach you.

245
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.992
- Nora?
- Sorry. uh. sorry. Mom.

246
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.390
I just. uh.
thought of something

247
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.597
that's going to help Dad...
I-I got to go.

248
00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.077
Babe. this is a first!

249
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.799
We've worked together before.

250
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.274
We have. Detective.

251
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.556
but anytime we did anything
even close to this.

252
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.791
I didn't have my abilities.

253
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.911
Okay. here we go.

254
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.755
Uh. if I fiddle with my ring.
you know.

255
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.354
assume that means she's lying

256
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.477
and then you just get in there
and. mm. mm.

257
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.960
do your thing.
You cop it up.

258
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.714
Prednisone. sirolimus.
abatacept.

259
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.996
All drugs classified
as immunosuppressants.

260
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.754
They also happen to have
all been reported stolen

261
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.840
from this facility.

262
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.115
I'm aware of the report.

263
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.200
What I'm wondering

264
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.576
is why it warrants the interest
of the DA?

265
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.592
We believe
that the missing medications

266
00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.990
are connected
to a much higher profile case.

267
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.753
Orlin Dwyer.

268
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.911
Grace Gibbons' uncle.

269
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.799
Is he still at large?
I don't really watch the news.

270
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.794
Yes. he's very much at large.

271
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.918
And we have reason to believe
that those exact medications

272
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.216
are the ones that Dwyer would
need to treat his injuries.

273
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.515
What are you saying exactly?

274
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.035
Your records
of the stolen meds

275
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.954
continued after Dwyer stopped
visiting the hospital.

276
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.872
Which means that someone here

277
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.713
may be still supplying them
to him.

278
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.598
Sounds like a good theory.

279
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.080
but I don't know
who that could be.

280
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.311
Everything I know
is in those reports.

281
00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.272
Okay. okay.

282
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.635
That's enough for now.

283
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.473
Thank you very much
for your time.

284
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.711
Of course.

285
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.314
What are you doing?

286
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.096
You're just gonna let her
walk away like that?

287
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.952
I-I didn't want to scare her.

288
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.396
We don't have enough evidence.
We don't even have a motive.

289
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.473
So. then. let me
keep doing my thing!

290
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.358
I'm not used to going
into an interview

291
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.397
factoring in
your meta-abilities.

292
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.199
I-I'm used to going in
using my gut.

293
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.078
What about my gut?

294
00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.312
All due respect.
this isn't about your gut.

295
00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.840
Huh.

296
00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.559
Look. Cecile.
what I meant to say was...

297
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.994
No. no. no. no. no. no. Joe.

298
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.878
You said exactly
what you meant.

299
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.679
and you know what? Right now.

300
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.195
I'm about to say
something that I mean.

301
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.636
Maybe we shouldn't be working
on this together after all.

302
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.395
Oh. man.

303
00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.994
<i>Okay. the clock's ticking.</i>

304
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.958
and we have no clue
how to convince Cicada

305
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.190
to take the cure.

306
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.476
but we still have
our best weapon.

307
00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.870
Your journal.
Your legacy.

308
00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.640
One of the biggest things
history remembers

309
00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.274
about The Flash is your ability

310
00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.352
to change people's
hearts and minds.

311
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.635
especially your enemies'.

312
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.360
and I have dozens of entries
about those times.

313
00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.193
Any chance you've got
the future words

314
00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.760
I say to Cicada in there?

315
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.036
Nope.
but I have your past words.

316
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.477
Magenta. she wanted to drop
an oil tanker on a hospital.

317
00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.597
but you convinced her
she was a good person.

318
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.673
You said. "Use that good
to beat the bad."

319
00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.400
Magenta had
split personalities.

320
00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.517
She literally had a good side
and a bad side.

321
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.353
That's not gonna work
with Cicada.

322
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.794
Leonard Snart.

323
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.200
he said he didn't want
to be saved

324
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.597
and you still found a way to
convince him to save himself.

325
00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.194
"There's a part of you
that knows

326
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.000
you don't have to let
your past define you."

327
00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.159
Except Snart had already
worked with us at that point.

328
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.870
Killer Frost.
you dared her to kill you.

329
00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.917
"Come on. live up to your name.
Killer Frost!"

330
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.354
- And what did she do?
- Nora.

331
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.272
Amunet. Plastique.
the list goes on and on.

332
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.320
Nora. all... all of these times
are... are different.

333
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.512
Cicada doesn't even care
if he lives when this is over.

334
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.798
What am I supposed to say
that he'll care about?

335
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.191
You'll know.
The Flash always knows.

336
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.633
So. when you think about it.
an anti-dampening array

337
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.313
is the way to stop him
in his tracks.

338
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.536
Sherloque. are you happy
to be going home soon?

339
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.960
Of course
I'm happy to go back.

340
00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.157
I just feel that...

341
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.277
somehow there's more work
to be done here.

342
00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.432
I think he's. uh.
talking about his lady friend.

343
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.592
You know. I have a bit
of experience with these. uh.

344
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.353
long-distance relationships.

345
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.875
I got one word for you:
holo-cube.

346
00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.679
These things work wonders.

347
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.000
Could I request that you stop
speaking. possibly forever?

348
00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.311
I can deduce from your
conversation when you came in

349
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.995
that you have indeed tracked
down Cicada's next target

350
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.117
but do need help
facilitating the conversation

351
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.400
between Cicada and The Flash.

352
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.834
Correct? Yes?
Oh. good.

353
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.720
Come with me and I will
give you the solution.

354
00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.479
When did you figure it out?

355
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.036
I will miss you both
very much.

356
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.992
But you will miss me more!
<i>Allez!</i>

357
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.152
Philip Master!

358
00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.754
We good?

359
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.753
Yes. Philip Master is secure
in the pipeline.

360
00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:00.197
Wait. Acid Master's real name
is Philip Master?

361
00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.432
This is it.
Just like in the photo.

362
00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.592
The last confrontation
between Flash and Cicada.

363
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.115
Oh. what's the matter?

364
00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.032
You don't have one of these?

365
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.760
Bye-bye.

366
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.039
Cicada!

367
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.200
How long does he have?

368
00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.119
He has to hold that dagger
for 60 seconds. maybe less.

369
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.391
Flash better figure out
what he's going to say fast.

370
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.472
He will. I know he will.

371
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.199
I don't want to fight.

372
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.198
We have a cure.

373
00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.670
What are you talking about?

374
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.037
We have a way
to cure meta-humans.

375
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.874
We have a way to take
their powers away.

376
00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.234
We want you to take it.

377
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.280
And why would I agree
to do that?

378
00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.840
Your legacy.

379
00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.796
<i>I know how this ends.</i>

380
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.111
You keep killing.

381
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.358
and you're remembered
as a monster. not a hero.

382
00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.193
But we can change that
together.

383
00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.397
you can have
a different legacy.

384
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.119
You just have to choose it.

385
00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.958
I don't give a damn
about my legacy.

386
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.638
That was it.
That was our last chance.

387
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.879
We ran citywide
facial recognition scans

388
00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.474
and scanned
for dark matter signals

389
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.636
from Cicada's dagger.

390
00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.712
That was our last shot
at confronting Cicada.

391
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.154
We don't know that.

392
00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.296
We're changing the timeline.

393
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.437
That photo that Nora saw
at the Flash museum.

394
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.636
it could be different now.

395
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.840
Maybe it doesn't even exist.

396
00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.195
After all...

397
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.317
the timeline is malleable.

398
00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.271
I just don't understand
why our plan didn't work.

399
00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.556
Yeah. you guys
did everything right.

400
00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.736
The only reason it didn't work

401
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.160
is because
I couldn't convince him.

402
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.072
Dad. you're the Flash.

403
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.790
When the Flash speaks honestly
from his heart. people listen.

404
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.480
Not all people.

405
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.789
Let's keep searching.

406
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.236
I'm gonna check
the Cicada files at CCPD.

407
00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.959
See if I missed anything.

408
00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.635
Nora.

409
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.712
We just... we just
need to create

410
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.757
another window
of opportunity. okay?

411
00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.718
Dad can convince Cicada
to take the cure.

412
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:13.476
He just... he just needs
to find the right words.

413
00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.640
Barr.

414
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.074
What are you doing here
so late?

415
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.880
We hit a wall at S.T.A.R. Labs
tracking Cicada.

416
00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.953
Thought a change of scenery
would help. but...

417
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.714
Keep your head up. man.

418
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.634
We'll find him.
We always do.

419
00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.873
Honestly. I'm more worried
about what happens when we do.

420
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:43.113
Our whole plan depends on me
being able to convince Dwyer

421
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.760
to just take the cure.

422
00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.320
The last time I tried...

423
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.076
I don't think I've ever struck out
so hard.

424
00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.640
Wow. that's saying a lot

425
00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.552
considering your track record
at the plate.

426
00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.838
Wait. what exactly
did you say to him?

427
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.639
That he was creating
a legacy of fear.

428
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.519
one that would go down
in history.

429
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:10.197
but that we could work together
to change that.

430
00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.956
That sounds like
something the Flash would say.

431
00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.315
Well. I am the Flash.

432
00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.880
Look. that man's a zealot.

433
00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.360
He sees you in that suit

434
00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.896
and all he sees
is the thing he hates.

435
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.240
Meta-human. superpowers.

436
00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.936
the thing that took his niece
away from him.

437
00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.917
He can't see past the Flash.

438
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.080
but what he doesn't know...

439
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.516
there's a whole lot
more to you than that.

440
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.999
Be more Barry Allen.
Human.

441
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:35.996
Yeah. you're right.

442
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.958
Thanks. I'm gonna dive back in.

443
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.800
I'll let you get back
to running down Ambres.

444
00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.758
Actually...

445
00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.833
me and Cecile ran
into a wall ourselves.

446
00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.596
We are... uh. she... like.
working together.

447
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.196
I mean. ever since
she got her powers.

448
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.115
it's like she's
a human lie detector.

449
00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.350
How is that a bad thing?

450
00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.238
You know I've always
prided myself

451
00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.960
on being able to read people.
right?

452
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:07.035
But Cecile and these powers.
I mean. she puts me to shame.

453
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.395
Well. you just
got to remember

454
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.800
that you guys are a team.

455
00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.599
That makes her strengths
your strengths

456
00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.956
and yours hers.

457
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.536
So if you let her
do what she's great at.

458
00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.233
it's only going to
create more room

459
00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.136
for you to do more of what
you're great at too. right?

460
00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.313
Well. damn.

461
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.313
You're getting real good
at these pep talks. Barr.

462
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.710
Well. I had
a pretty good teacher.

463
00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.039
Hey. Nora.

464
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.120
Hi. Nora.

465
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.270
Yeah.

466
00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.272
Do you want to turn
that down a little bit?

467
00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.352
Hmm? Oh. sorry.

468
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.119
What are you listening to?

469
00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.192
Sped-up archives
of the Flash's comm recordings.

470
00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.034
I thought that if I listen
to his best appeals.

471
00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.351
I could figure out
what exactly worked so well.

472
00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.073
And did you?

473
00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.514
No. not yet.

474
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.592
But if I run the transcripts
through the computer.

475
00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.797
I can extrapolate
recurring key words

476
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.473
from his most successful
appeals

477
00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.553
and create a sort of
"best of speeches" speech.

478
00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.791
Well. um.

479
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.872
why don't you let your dad
think about it

480
00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.475
and we could go
to the rooftop of Jitters.

481
00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.631
It's a great place
to clear your mind.

482
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.256
plus it's got the best views
in the city.

483
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.079
You want to go sightseeing?
Right now?

484
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.038
What... is this from
that list of yours?

485
00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.191
Well. yeah. but...

486
00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.896
All day I've been trying
to figure out a way

487
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.479
to stop Cicada

488
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.120
and all day you've been
trying to pull me away.

489
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.793
Why are you pushing this list?

490
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.234
I mean.
it's just the last time

491
00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.880
that we may get
to spend together.

492
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.997
Nora. I mean.
once we stop Cicada.

493
00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.640
you'll go back to your time
and...

494
00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:48.598
us like this together will end.

495
00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.034
Mom. it doesn't end.

496
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.753
We have our whole future
together.

497
00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.696
Yeah. for you it'll feel
like no time has passed

498
00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:58.237
but for me.
it'll be decades before I...

499
00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.357
see you like this again.

500
00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.477
Uh. no. it's okay.

501
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:10.874
Um. I will catch up
with you later.

502
00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.555
Joe.

503
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.640
What's going on?

504
00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.080
Why'd you want me
to meet you here?

505
00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.352
Look. I know the last time
we tried to work together

506
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.715
went a bit south.

507
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.200
Oh. a bit?

508
00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.636
You're right.
I'm sorry. Cecile.

509
00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.679
I let my pride get in the way.

510
00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.150
and I didn't lean
on your strengths

511
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.072
when I should have.

512
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.038
But you know me.

513
00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.555
I'm not a man who makes
the same mistake twice.

514
00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.711
So...

515
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.600
Would you do me the honor

516
00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.474
of joining me
in this interrogation?

517
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.355
You do what you do best.
I'll take care of the rest.

518
00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.716
Get 'em. girl.

519
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.840
Detective. DA.

520
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.673
This is starting to border
on harassment.

521
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.513
I have told you
everything I know.

522
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.670
That's not true.

523
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.673
We know that you've been
funneling meds to Orlin Dwyer.

524
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.760
Well. if you knew that.

525
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.071
then I'd be arrested
and not sitting here.

526
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.039
Let me correct myself.

527
00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.113
We have a strong hunch.

528
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.759
but I bet if we were
to go through

529
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.036
the video camera footage
from the hospital.

530
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.158
we'll find proof
that you were assisting Dwyer.

531
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.276
I'm a doctor.

532
00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.829
I mean. why would I condone
a vigilante murderer?

533
00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.116
Because of what happened
to Darius.

534
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.676
Darius.

535
00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.236
It hurts you
to even think about him.

536
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.471
My fiancÃ© was killed
by meta-humans

537
00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.560
during Zoom's rampage.

538
00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.233
So. yes. it hurts
to think about him.

539
00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:00.439
Hurt enough for you to help
Dwyer kill other meta-humans?

540
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.670
Correct me if I'm wrong.

541
00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.831
you took an oath to do no harm.
right?

542
00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.839
Can you truthfully say
you upheld that oath?

543
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.193
That guilt that you feel
right now?

544
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.158
There's a way
to make up for it.

545
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.960
All you have to do
is help us find Orlin.

546
00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.997
What. so... so you can put him
in jail? Kill him?

547
00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.231
No. so we can cure him.

548
00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.470
It's not possible.

549
00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.836
Maybe not with the medicine
you've been giving him.

550
00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.116
but S.T.A.R. Labs
has created a treatment

551
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:32.513
that turns metas back
into normal human beings.

552
00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.919
I can't take you to him.

553
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.560
Okay. okay.
then help us set up a meet.

554
00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.711
Look. Dr. Ambres. it's clear.

555
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.315
You've come to truly care
for Dwyer.

556
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.598
So we're asking you now...

557
00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.751
help us save his life.

558
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.437
I can make contact.
and I can share the location.

559
00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.554
I have rounds in an hour

560
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.359
and patients
that I can save tonight.

561
00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.119
So am I free to go. please?

562
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.793
I love my job.

563
00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.349
I can stay here all night.

564
00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.070
And we will. unless you tell us
what you're keeping hidden

565
00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.594
right now.

566
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.596
Yo. yo. I got your text.
You talked to Ambres?

567
00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.718
Cecile and I together
got through to her.

568
00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.315
She's going to show us
where to find Dwyer.

569
00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.470
Joe. that's amazing.

570
00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.791
Yeah. Ambres told us
something else.

571
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:45.510
Dwyer's niece. Grace?
She's a meta.

572
00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.915
So <i>le petit</i> Dwyer is a meta.

573
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.720
Wait. I thought we scanned Grace
for meta powers

574
00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.439
when Nora entered her brain.

575
00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.080
We did. but that was back
when her DNA was 100 percent human.

576
00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.560
Her powers must have
activated

577
00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.154
in just the last few weeks.
right?

578
00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.677
Yeah. Ambres told Joe
that the wound in Grace's head

579
00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.672
recently started glowing
and mutating.

580
00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:15.437
Now all we need to do is get
Dwyer to listen to you. again.

581
00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.080
Killer Frost can put him
on ice from the neck down.

582
00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.675
Better yet. I can re-sequence
the Speed Force Bazooka

583
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.638
to overload him
with negative tachyons

584
00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.176
so that he's just stuck there.
listening to him.

585
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.096
Tachyon. shmack-yon.
No. no. <i>La Machine Ã  MÃ©moire!</i>

586
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.360
We could go inside
Dwyer's mind.

587
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.196
- Guys...
- No. <i>La Machine Ã  MÃ©moire!</i>

588
00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.715
Guys. hey!

589
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.110
I appreciate the enthusiasm.

590
00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.438
but I think we need to take
a different approach.

591
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:44.833
No powers. no crazy plans.

592
00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.071
The Flash can't convince
Cicada to stop this.

593
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.551
but... maybe...

594
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.597
I can.

595
00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.032
- Hey.
- Hey.

596
00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.120
Dad's back.

597
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.954
He says Papa Joe's
got news about Dwyer.

598
00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.953
Okay. good. I guess we should
get over to the Cortex.

599
00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.914
You know. I had a list too.

600
00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.470
Your wedding.
Auntie Jenna's baby shower.

601
00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.598
Jitters. The Enlightenment.

602
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.671
Those were all
the moments in time

603
00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.353
you wanted to go back
and see us?

604
00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.194
Yeah. so I could have
memories and experiences

605
00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.272
with all of you.

606
00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.794
I get it.

607
00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.669
I should've been sensitive
and I-I'm so sorry.

608
00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.639
- It's okay.
- No. it's not.

609
00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.952
I was so focused on making sure
Flash beat Cicada.

610
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:45.956
I forgot what I was supposed
to really be focused on.

611
00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.760
You and Dad.

612
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.719
You're the reason
I came back to this time.

613
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:56.477
not fighting big bads
or getting my own XS-presso.

614
00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.917
It was so that I could spend time
with my parents.

615
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.560
My family.

616
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.996
I don't know how much time
we have left together

617
00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.238
or how much of your list
we're going to get done.

618
00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:12.394
but from now on.
every moment we have left.

619
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.199
we're going to make it
a memorable one.

620
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.555
I promise.

621
00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.278
Well. I guess we can cross off
"hugging while drinking tea"

622
00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.079
- off our list.
- Yeah.

623
00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.959
Hey. guys.
sorry to interrupt.

624
00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.191
No. it's fine.
We were just...

625
00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.511
We were just talking
about Mom's list.

626
00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.000
Um. so I heard Dad
has a lead on Dwyer?

627
00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.799
We have a location.

628
00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.360
I'm going to head there
any minute.

629
00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.239
Does Flash know what
he's going to say this time?

630
00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:51.035
Actually. I think
I'm just gonna talk to him.

631
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.237
father to father.

632
00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.198
That's a really good idea.
Dad.

633
00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.879
Hey. Doc.

634
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.477
Dr. Ambres told us
where to find you.

635
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.869
I just want to talk.

636
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:23.273
There's no more talking.

637
00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:28.480
Every time one of you metas
comes near the rest of us.

638
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.234
good people get hurt.

639
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.358
This is what you all deserve.

640
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.352
Does that include Grace?

641
00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.798
Ambres hasn't told you.

642
00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.351
Grace. She's a meta.

643
00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.716
The night
the satellite crashed.

644
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.678
she was hit
with a piece of shrapnel

645
00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:50.955
infected with dark matter.

646
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.396
That's... that's why
she's in a coma.

647
00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.716
and now it's changing her.

648
00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.951
That's a lie.

649
00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.430
And that's why Ambres
told us where to find you.

650
00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:01.874
She's afraid.

651
00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.536
She's afraid you're going
to do the one thing

652
00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.880
you can't come back from.

653
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:14.312
I know how much you care
about Grace.

654
00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.074
You're trying to make the world
a better place for her.

655
00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:20.039
She didn't choose to be a meta.

656
00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.873
but she is.

657
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.236
Does that mean
she deserves to die?

658
00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.551
No.

659
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.997
I would never hurt Grace.

660
00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.675
Then you'd let her grow up
in a world of fear.

661
00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:35.958
Where there's someone out there
hurting people like her.

662
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:42.871
The cure.
it will heal Grace and you.

663
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.714
And why should
I believe you. Flash?

664
00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.875
Because I'm a father too.

665
00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.031
My daughter.

666
00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:15.831
I love her more than
I ever thought possible.

667
00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.832
I would do anything
to make the world

668
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.400
a better place for her.

669
00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.473
And I think you would too.

670
00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.634
So do it.

671
00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.876
We made an arrangement.

672
00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.873
We cure him and then Grace.

673
00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.280
Okay.

674
00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:54.479
Why are we here
and not at a hospital?

675
00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:58.270
We have to be sure
that the cure is successful.

676
00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.840
We created it.

677
00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.593
We're the ones who know
how it works.

678
00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.718
Once administered.
the cure will take 60 seconds

679
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.599
to eliminate the meta-human
powers in your system.

680
00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.798
That means the wound
in your chest will then open.

681
00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.280
You'll need me
to suture it shut

682
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.794
so you don't bleed out.

683
00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.439
Why not Doc Ambres?

684
00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.000
She's being held
for questioning.

685
00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:21.797
No. it's Ambres.
or we're done.

686
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.759
All right. we'll get her.

687
00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.395
If anything goes wrong.

688
00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.790
or if you're lying to me.

689
00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:37.591
I'll kill every... last...

690
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.955
one of you.

691
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.515
And we're certain everything
in this room is sterile?

692
00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:48.876
Of course.

693
00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.713
Everything except that.

694
00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.794
That thing's not negotiable.

695
00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.751
That rage of his. it's...

696
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.915
Joe. I can't.

697
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Are you going to stay?

698
00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.311
Uh. yeah. just in case.

699
00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.359
- Okay.
- All right. babe.

700
00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.715
Good job today.

701
00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.917
You too. Partner.

702
00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.514
We never could have done this
without you guys.

703
00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.159
Well. I'm glad
it worked out.

704
00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:29.358
but when this is over.
he's going to jail.

705
00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.671
for a long time.

706
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:37.956
Okay. one fresh serving
of piping hot meta-human cure.

707
00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.936
I'm just supposed to trust
that that thing works?

708
00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.191
Has it gone through
any human testing?

709
00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.192
It's gone through
giant shark testing.

710
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.554
It's a long story.

711
00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.990
It's okay. Doc.

712
00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.436
I wanted to tell you
the truth about Grace.

713
00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.274
I just couldn't find the words.

714
00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.671
You were just trying
to keep her safe.

715
00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.070
I'll always be thankful
for that.

716
00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.591
See you on the other side.

717
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.514
Here we go.

718
00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.597
Injecting the cure.

719
00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.916
His vitals are spiking.

720
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.696
How can we tell
if the cure is even working?

721
00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.757
Oh. it's working.

722
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.593
My powers are back.

723
00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.717
Which means Dwyer's powers
must be gone.

724
00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.794
Well...

725
00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.520
It appears your sojourn
into the past was a success.

726
00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.040
Congratulations.

727
00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.679
Thank you.

728
00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.639
You as well.
It's your. uh. 38th Cicada?

729
00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.074
That's right. yes.

730
00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.753
38th Cicada.
<i>Trente-huit</i> Cicada.

731
00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.956
<i>Allez-hop!</i>

732
00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.997
But. of course.
there's some business here

733
00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.912
that remains unfinished.

734
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.469
For instance. how did you know
before you saw the burn marks

735
00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.029
in the photograph
that it was a meta-human

736
00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.356
that would lead us to Cicada?

737
00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.750
Uh. I...

738
00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.320
You know. I just had
this feeling

739
00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.551
that something big was coming.

740
00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.191
They're working on him now.

741
00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.273
I will be so happy
when this is all over with.

742
00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.078
What's going on?

743
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.799
What happened to the power?

744
00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.395
I have no idea.

745
00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.630
I should check the Med Lab.

746
00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.952
- Someone's coming.
- Who?

747
00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:38.319
Cicada?

748
00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.357
Where's that coming from?

749
00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.440
Cisco!

750
00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.193
- Hold on!
- Iris.

751
00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.397
- Careful.
- I can't see anything.

752
00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.880
Here.

753
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.514
Cisco. we need power.

754
00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.159
We got a much bigger problem.

755
00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.709
Cicada?

756
00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:19.960
How the hell did that happen?

757
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.296
I don't know.
but he's coming here

758
00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.320
and he looks pissed.

759
00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.834
We have to move now.

760
00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.016
I've got to keep
patching him up.

761
00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.759
Stand back.

762
00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.951
There.

763
00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.477
- He's in the hallway.
- Get the hell out of here.

764
00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.954
Iris! Get down!

765
00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.919
Come on!

766
00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.153
Who are you?

767
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:40.794
Please. whoever you are.

768
00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.236
I only came here
to make him human again!

769
00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.391
I helped him!

770
00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.635
Please!

771
00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.757
Please don't do this!

772
00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.832
Nope. They're all toast.

773
00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.479
Well. better the computers
than us.

774
00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.517
Joe.

775
00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.670
Are you okay?

776
00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:37.480
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I'm a little bruised. but...

777
00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:38.994
Everybody else?

778
00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.270
Yeah. we're okay.

779
00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.794
Guys...

780
00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.359
Dr. Ambres didn't make it.

781
00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.271
There's no sign of them
anywhere.

782
00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.192
I don't understand
what happened.

783
00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.749
I mean. we got Dwyer.
we gave him the cure.

784
00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:58.753
If... if Cicada doesn't exist
anymore. who was that?

785
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.912
Someone worse.

786
00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.070
I've missed you...

787
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.912
Uncle Orlin.

788
00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.954
<i>Greg. move your head.</i>
