<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.199
<i>You're no longer you.</i>

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.590
<i>You're a part
of a negative force.</i>

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.593
Thawne's Speed Force
is fueled by negative emotions.

5
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.736
- What do you do?
- Trust me.

6
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.096
you wouldn't believe
me if I told you.

7
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.794
You're not super satisfied
with your secret identity.

8
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.156
Are you saying
I don't want to be Vibe?

9
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.277
<i>There won't be any future
for any metas</i>

10
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.794
<i>if we don't get rid
of that dagger.</i>

11
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.758
<i>If anything's gonna
destroy that dagger.</i>

12
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.840
<i>it's this Mirror Gun.</i>

13
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.916
It works.

14
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.480
Follow my instructions

15
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.596
<i>and we'll defeat Cicada.</i>

16
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.680
<i>destroy her dagger.</i>

17
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.876
<i>and save your father.</i>

18
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.350
Thawne is manipulating her.

19
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.080
<i>He's on death row.
How is he manipulating her?</i>

20
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.514
<i>Something doesn't add up.</i>

21
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.279
The dagger
is Thawne's plan.

22
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.518
Don't shoot it!

23
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.115
<i>I always wanted
to be a hero.</i>

24
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.150
<i>to use my extraordinary
abilities to help people.</i>

25
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.078
<i>That's why I came here.</i>

26
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.995
<i>To meet my family.
to stop Cicada.</i>

27
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.197
<i>help fix
the Flash's legacy.</i>

28
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.920
<i>and save him from
disappearing in the future.</i>

29
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.078
<i>I believed I could
do the impossible.</i>

30
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.358
<i>but I never imagined
it would turn out like this.</i>

31
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.637
No. no!
What's he doing?

32
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.192
Cicada... Thawne.
dagger.

33
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.875
<i>How's Ralph?</i>

34
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.016
I've never seen
anything like it.

35
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.360
I can't quite figure it out.

36
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.397
His cells are
kinetically inverted.

37
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.616
It's like they're
the reverse of themselves.

38
00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.336
I should've spent more time
trying to figure out

39
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.760
how this thing works.

40
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.336
I just don't understand
why he would jump

41
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.589
in front of that blast.

42
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.776
I mean. why would
he do that?

43
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.678
That's the question.
isn't it?

44
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.355
That's the question.

45
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.871
In other news.
Cicada deuce is still MIA.

46
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.496
All right.
we should get to CCPD.

47
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.080
see if we can find anything
that could help us track her.

48
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.034
What?

49
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.958
I'm supposed to meet up
with Kamilla later.

50
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.696
I thought things were going
really well for you two.

51
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.074
They are.

52
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.470
I just haven't told her about

53
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.677
my vibratory alter ego yet.

54
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.514
Cisco. if you're serious
about being with her.

55
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.193
you have to tell
her the truth.

56
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.793
I know.

57
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.674
All the metas that we
couldn't cure.

58
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.991
we got safely evacuated.
and they're waiting

59
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.753
at a protected
holding facility.

60
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.513
Nice work. both of you.

61
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.760
Well the work's not done yet.

62
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.200
I mean. the metas
are safe for now.

63
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.600
but Cicada's still out there.

64
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.114
so the people
are still in danger.

65
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.759
Fill me in
on the details.

66
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.116
I'm ready for
this nightmare to end.

67
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.993
It should've been
over already.

68
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.594
Nora. look.

69
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.115
I'm sure Ralph
had a good reason.

70
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.112
Until we figure out
what it is. we just gotta

71
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.112
concentrate on this.
all right?

72
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.270
Wait a second.

73
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.233
What is that?

74
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.589
Looks like wood.

75
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.720
From what?

76
00:03:21.721 --> 00:03:23.074
I mean. the floor is marble.

77
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.355
furniture's untouched.

78
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.120
and the skylight's made
of glass and metal.

79
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.270
Well if it didn't come

80
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.600
from Cicada's point of entry...

81
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.479
She must've brought
it from somewhere else.

82
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.074
<i>What do we do now?</i>

83
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.516
You know what to do.

84
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.071
Hit them when they
least expect it.

85
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.516
When they least
expect it.

86
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.760
The Time Sphere.

87
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.240
If I repair it.

88
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.357
I can bring the
last of the virus back

89
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.716
to the night
of the Particle Accelerator.

90
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.158
When meta-humans first
appeared in Central City...

91
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.233
And the Flash becomes
a hero to stop me.

92
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.111
<i>Destroy the meta-humans
before they destroy the world.</i>

93
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.638
They'll be born
only to die.

94
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.517
Definitely some
kind of wood fragment.

95
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.115
And you think those will lead
us to where Cicada's hiding?

96
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.475
We can find out.

97
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.234
We can cross-reference this.
see what kind of wood it is.

98
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.840
then see where we end up.

99
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.558
Is there any
progress on Ralph?

100
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.456
No. he's still unconscious.
and I can't figure out

101
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.199
a way to reverse his cells.

102
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.936
So I guess that means we
still don't know why

103
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.696
he jumped in front
of that Mirror Gun. do we?

104
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.154
We do.

105
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.480
We do...

106
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.394
because Dibny solved
the greatest mystery of all.

107
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.314
The Flash legacy.
how to stop Cicada.

108
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.551
repentance for his past sins...

109
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.314
all the reasons
Eobard Thawne was helping you.

110
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.835
And stopping Dad
from disappearing in the future.

111
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.720
Disappearing in the future
is part of it. hmm?

112
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.031
But this has nothing
to do with your father.

113
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.399
The real reason that Thawne
wishes to defeat Cicada

114
00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.915
and destroy Cicada's dagger

115
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.640
is because this dagger

116
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.077
is the only thing keeping
the Reverse-Flash in prison.

117
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.755
Guess this is it.

118
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.071
Looks like it.
doesn't it?

119
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.594
Mm.

120
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.712
I almost forgot.

121
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.757
I contacted the Flash Museum.

122
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.912
had them send
something over for today.

123
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.390
I thought it should
be buried for good...

124
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.840
along with you.

125
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.679
Consider it
a parting gift.

126
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.589
Destroying Cicada's
dagger in the past

127
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.400
will save Thawne
from dying in the future?

128
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.755
That's right.

129
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.553
Cicada's dagger
has been dampening

130
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.597
Thawne's powers
all this time.

131
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.195
So if we get rid
of the dagger now.

132
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.555
it disappears
in the future?

133
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.239
And Thawne gets out
of Iron Heights.

134
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.152
A reverse time hack.

135
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.516
Everything you said
about Thawne is true.

136
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.274
The only person
he ever helps is himself.

137
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.496
Nora. this is not your fault.

138
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.874
Yes. it is.

139
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.039
Now. the question
we have to ask...

140
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.194
do we stop Cicada
or do we stop Thawne?

141
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.476
No. we're not gonna let
thousands of meta-humans die.

142
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.153
now or in the future.

143
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.390
We find Cicada.

144
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.234
We destroy the dagger
once and for all.

145
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.475
You gotta get
out of here.

146
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.597
No. we gotta wait
for the results...

147
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.433
We can handle
it until you get back.

148
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.273
Go see Kamilla.

149
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.360
How do you choose?

150
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.638
That's more of a question
for Iris than for me.

151
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.234
Hey.

152
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.789
Hey.

153
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.714
She seems to be happy
with my photos.

154
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.837
I was kinda hoping
she'd send me over to CCPD

155
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.400
to take photos of
the meta-humans

156
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.616
when they were
getting that cure.

157
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.316
Can you imagine being there
when that Cicada guy attacked?

158
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.313
Cicada woman. actually.

159
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.635
A woman?

160
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.310
Her name's
Grace Gibbons.

161
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.074
Her uncle was
the first Cicada.

162
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.234
She killed him after he took
the meta-human cure.

163
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.319
The cure that I made.

164
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.312
The cure you made?

165
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.635
You're serious.

166
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.360
That's the scientific project
you've been working on?

167
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.194
At S.T.A.R. Labs.

168
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.069
You never told me your lab
was S.T.A.R. Labs.

169
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.951
There's a lot
I haven't told you.

170
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.077
What is that
supposed to mean?

171
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.153
You're Vibe.

172
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.954
Look. Kamilla.

173
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.834
I've seen firsthand
how hard it is

174
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.680
to have two lives
like this.

175
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.433
And I tried to separate
you from that.

176
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.070
but I don't want to keep
this from you anymore.

177
00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.800
I can't keep lying
to you like this.

178
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.156
I'm sorry.

179
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.597
I'm sorry.

180
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.313
Cisco. wait.

181
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.517
I totally get it.

182
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.717
I've read a lot
of comic books.

183
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.315
I know all the tropes
that go with

184
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.551
revealing secret
identities.

185
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.439
But in real life.
I would never expect you

186
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.477
to tell me something
like this right away.

187
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.400
You're amazing.
you know that?

188
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.870
Cisco. this isn't
about me.

189
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.394
It's about you.

190
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.110
If being Vibe is a part
of the life you want.

191
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.192
I would never get
in the way of that.

192
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.992
You know.
you really are a lot like me.

193
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.072
Trusting.

194
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.320
And you always blame yourself
when things go wrong.

195
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.477
How do I fix this?

196
00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.155
I don't know
if you can. Nora.

197
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.837
You made a mistake.

198
00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.798
you know?

199
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.031
A big mistake.

200
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.880
Sometimes in life.
all we can do is just

201
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.917
live with the consequences.

202
00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.350
So what you have to ask
yourself is

203
00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.750
what kind of hero
are you gonna be?

204
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.715
One who takes a do-over
after every mistake.

205
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.880
or one who lives with it
and moves forward?

206
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.715
Nothing?

207
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.156
Nope. I still cannot
figure out how to reset

208
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.240
his cells back
to normal.

209
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.595
He's till Humpty Dumpty'd.
huh?

210
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.909
Yep.

211
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.096
He hasn't been
this much of a mess

212
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.032
since he first got his powers.

213
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.271
Since...

214
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.194
And what did you do
to help him then?

215
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.636
We introduced a stabilizing
enzyme that reset

216
00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.997
his body back to its original
form using vulcanization...

217
00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.080
and muscle memory.

218
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.600
Muscle memory.

219
00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.155
Well then. it appears
all that we need to do

220
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.310
is wake him up.

221
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.680
How would you
suggest we do that?

222
00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.080
Simple.

223
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.676
We blast him.

224
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.319
We blast him?

225
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.512
If you blast him.
right. the vibrational jolt.

226
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.957
it will be more than enough
to kick-start his consciousness.

227
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.235
I'm sure of it.

228
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.470
Can't we just play some Gaga

229
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.630
and hope he wakes up?

230
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.473
Gaga is not the solution
to everything.

231
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.710
You have to blast him.

232
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.096
<i>Allez.</i> young Ralph Macchio.
please.

233
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.316
Be careful.
This could get a little ugly.

234
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.632
Okay.

235
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.916
Sorry. deuce.

236
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.109
WrestleMania!

237
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.031
Voilà!
Good as new.

238
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.520
Blasted why
you happen what?

239
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.600
Hmm?

240
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.911
B-b-blasted why
you happen what?

241
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.200
Except for
the language skills.

242
00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.670
Those will return.
probably.

243
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.640
Come on.

244
00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.000
Everybody going.
where is?

245
00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.271
Everybody going
where... every...

246
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.560
What is it?

247
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.016
It's the wood particles
you guys found.

248
00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.110
Swiss ash.

249
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.079
Part of the flowering ash trees
indigenous to Europe.

250
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.231
but also make up
our biggest wood space

251
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.596
not 12 miles
from Central City.

252
00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.909
Kolins Woods.

253
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.176
That's where Cicada
almost killed me.

254
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.856
That's also one of the
largest wooded parks

255
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.473
in the country.
We need a better plan.

256
00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.835
I've got one...

257
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.594
that can stop
Cicada and Thawne.

258
00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.756
Out to sniff? So really
we're using her Cecile?

259
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.196
Well. she is a highly
sensitive empath

260
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.357
and Cicada emanates hate.

261
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.874
DA Cecile Horton will serve

262
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.873
as our early warning
detection system.

263
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.429
If we're lucky.
Cicada won't see what's coming.

264
00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.876
<i>Then once we find Cicada Il
and trap her.</i>

265
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.031
we give Young Grace
the choice to take the cure.

266
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.396
And hopefully. when
she's no longer a meta...

267
00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.709
That bitch will
cease to exist.

268
00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.554
That way we can stop her
without destroying the dagger

269
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.233
and Thawne never goes free.

270
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.616
Now all you have
to do is help Grace

271
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.640
make the right choice.

272
00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.160
What do I say?

273
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.197
Whatever's in your heart.
She'll listen.

274
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.033
What a bunch
of sentimental crap.

275
00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.396
You two sound like
a friggin' Hallmark movie.

276
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.795
I hear ya. sister.

277
00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.473
I think we're close.

278
00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.520
You good?

279
00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.751
Oh. yeah. jeez. sorry.

280
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.672
Uh. this way.

281
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.352
Here we go.

282
00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.111
The Sphere is ready.

283
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.356
We can leave.

284
00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.397
Guys. we found her.
Get ready.

285
00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.954
I'm actually glad
you found me before we left.

286
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.918
Now I can end your lives
twice today.

287
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.912
Not on my watch.

288
00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.512
- We got her.
- Nora. you're up.

289
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.160
If you can connect
to Grace as an adult.

290
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.576
you can connect
with her as a child.

291
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.671
You just have to tap
into her anger.

292
00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.114
You can do this.

293
00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.313
You shouldn't
have come back here. Nora.

294
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.629
I had to. Grace.

295
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.960
because a lot of people are
gonna die unless you help me.

296
00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.034
If I can help it.
you'll be the first to die.

297
00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.513
Uh. the force field's integrity

298
00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.434
just went down to 86 percent.

299
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.036
Grace. I know you think your
uncle wanted all metas dead.

300
00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.514
but he was a meta.

301
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.000
That's why he took the cure

302
00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.520
and why he wants you
to have it too.

303
00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.155
You're a meta.
just like your uncle.

304
00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.879
No I'm not!
Take it back.

305
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.237
70 percent... 52...

306
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.880
Don't listen to her.
Gracie.

307
00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.156
This hate.
It's consuming you.

308
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.799
turning you
into a monster.

309
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.190
And what's worse.
you're all alone.

310
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.953
Uncle Orlin
wouldn't leave me.

311
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.190
He had no choice.

312
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.670
Take the cure
just like your uncle did.

313
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.399
No.

314
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.475
40 percent..

315
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.870
Nora's gotta
convince Grace now.

316
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.469
Metas killed your parents.
Gracie.

317
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.870
They all deserve to die.

318
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.314
Don't believe him. Grace.

319
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.675
This is just
in your mind.

320
00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.950
She's right. Gracie.

321
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.599
It's why you created him.

322
00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.040
He's the man
who took care of you.

323
00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.914
19 percent.

324
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.616
I know a part of you knows
that this is wrong.

325
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.552
But the other dark
part of you is out there

326
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.711
in the real world
killing innocent people.

327
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.917
You can make a choice
to stop it.

328
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.195
How?

329
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.800
Wake up
and take the cure.

330
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.800
Shut up.

331
00:16:11.801 --> 00:16:13.201
You can do this. Gracie.

332
00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.560
Get ready.

333
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.640
Grace.

334
00:16:21.641 --> 00:16:22.560
- Gracie.
- Grace.

335
00:16:22.561 --> 00:16:24.199
- Grace. Grace
- Grace. Grace.

336
00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.999
<i>Grace!</i>

337
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.034
Okay. I don't
want people to die.

338
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.351
I'll take the cure.

339
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.231
Thank you.

340
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.358
Here she comes.

341
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.832
Okay.

342
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.311
<i>Did it work?
Guys. what's happening?</i>

343
00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.872
Joe. no!

344
00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.871
Now I'll finish
what I started.

345
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.996
It didn't work.

346
00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.634
That shard in her head.

347
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.393
It's still part
of the dagger.

348
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.597
Its dark energy is enough
to counteract the cure.

349
00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.878
If we want to cure Grace.
we must destroy that dagger.

350
00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.520
No. no. no.

351
00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.353
No. no. no!

352
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.159
Nora!

353
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.958
You took my family
away from me. Flash.

354
00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.396
Now watch me take yours.

355
00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.358
- No!
<i>- Barry!</i>

356
00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.472
Just in time.

357
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.797
Gentlemen.

358
00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.475
I hate to inform you. but...

359
00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.113
You're all dead.

360
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.751
Thawne...

361
00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.036
I... I... I can help you.

362
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.477
Isn't this ironic?

363
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.556
Time to repent.

364
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.919
Consider this
a parting gift.

365
00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:16.636
Just... in...

366
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.875
Well. well.

367
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.156
It appears as if someone
has figured out

368
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.153
how to reverse time.

369
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.038
Clever girl.

370
00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.679
We figured
out everything.

371
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.832
Oh. really?

372
00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.479
What have you figured out?

373
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.951
We figured out why
you sent Nora back.

374
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.680
why you had her punch
DeVoe's satellite...

375
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.911
to create a Cicada
we could stop.

376
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.070
Right?

377
00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.160
A dagger

378
00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.953
we could destroy.

379
00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.496
It was the dagger
that was keeping you

380
00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.352
in prison all
along. wasn't it?

381
00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.476
That's right.

382
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.040
15 years.

383
00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.635
The second time I've
been stuck somewhere

384
00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.679
against my will
for 15 years.

385
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.160
Boring.

386
00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.312
Except for your visits.
of course.

387
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.199
You're leaving out
the most delightful part:

388
00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.590
how you both
helped me escape.

389
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.200
We helped you?

390
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.634
That's right.
When you traveled

391
00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.359
to the Time Vault.
remember that?

392
00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.397
<i>Oh. we need help
trying to figure out</i>

393
00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.795
<i>how to drain dark energy</i>

394
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.190
<i>from the
"one who got away."</i>

395
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.033
Cicada's!

396
00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.909
Remember that?
When you blurted that out

397
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.231
in the middle of the Time Vault.
so that years later.

398
00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.696
when I ended up
with Cicada's dagger

399
00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.760
strapped to my chest.
I knew exactly what I had to do:

400
00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.718
get Nora Allen to trust me.

401
00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.029
Easy.

402
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.477
Just like when I got
you to trust me.

403
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.473
and then everything starts
falling into place.

404
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.153
Why?

405
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.392
Because I am
the only speedster

406
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.473
that knows how
to manipulate the timeline

407
00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.712
to get what I want.

408
00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.759
orchestrate the changes
that I need.

409
00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.309
some of which...

410
00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.874
are happening right now.

411
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.838
to ensure one thing:

412
00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:08.039
That I go free.

413
00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.351
We don't need
a dagger to stop you.

414
00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.397
Well then.

415
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.637
let's just see how much
your father taught you.

416
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.072
I guess you're not
as good a teacher as I am.

417
00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.038
You can't save him. Nora.

418
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.191
No matter what you do.

419
00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:06.230
no matter what you try.
the Flash will always vanish.

420
00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.438
That is his legacy.

421
00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.274
Isn't this nice?

422
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:51.877
Team Flash.
back together again...

423
00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.713
with a new guy.

424
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.836
Ralph Dibny.

425
00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.558
Welcome.
You should be dead.

426
00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.353
Yeah. I guess
we have that in common.

427
00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.553
We'll take care of that
in a moment.

428
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.154
Iris.

429
00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.560
Always a pleasure.

430
00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.074
Frost.

431
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.152
Cisco.

432
00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.351
It warms my heart
to see you again.

433
00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.716
I want to apologize for...

434
00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.359
But had I not done that.

435
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:24.599
you never would've had the means
to become extraordinary.

436
00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.194
I don't need
powers for that.

437
00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.637
Now!

438
00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.719
It's not my father's legacy
that's gonna disappear. Thawne.

439
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.200
It's yours.

440
00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.999
- Nora!
- Hey!

441
00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.915
So close.
Little Runner.

442
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.356
It was never going
to work anyway.

443
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.238
- Mom? Dad?
- No.

444
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.398
- No. no. no. no.
- Mom. what's happening?

445
00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.673
A new timeline is setting in.

446
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.117
- What?
- A new timeline that you created

447
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.192
when you destroyed
the dagger!

448
00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.193
I'm sorry.
Little Runner.

449
00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.272
for trading you in like this.

450
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:55.673
But I had to be sure
that I could go free.

451
00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.192
You can still
save her. Barry.

452
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.198
There's still time.
You can still save her.

453
00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.999
How?

454
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.151
The Negative Speed Force.

455
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.640
She has to go there.

456
00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:11.270
It's the only place immune
to timeline changes.

457
00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.397
But you have to go now.

458
00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.199
You have to go. Barry!

459
00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.596
Or we lose her forever.

460
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.271
That's right.
I've grown fond of her too.

461
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.714
In many ways...

462
00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.874
she's shown me what it's like
to have a daughter.

463
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.440
See you in our next crisis.

464
00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.880
I can't do this.

465
00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.456
Yes you can. yes you can.
You have to. all right?

466
00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.709
Just hold on
a little longer.

467
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.598
No. Dad. I can't.

468
00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.000
Nora!

469
00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.555
I can't.

470
00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.999
- Nora. what are we doing?
- It's too late.

471
00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.256
What? No. it's not.
We gotta go back.

472
00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.999
- Dad. no.
- Barry. you have

473
00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.296
- to take her back.
- I know. I know.

474
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.549
- Mom. Mom.
- I know. I know.

475
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.313
Nora. you have
to go back now.

476
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.880
No!

477
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.317
If I go back in.
the Negative Speed Force

478
00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.039
will be a part
of me forever.

479
00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.554
No. we'll get
it out of you. Nora.

480
00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.936
We can get it out.
we can save you.

481
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.839
- Please. I promise.
- Mom. you can't.

482
00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.355
Mom. you can't.

483
00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.554
None of you can.

484
00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.830
It's making me like Thawne.

485
00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.991
Full of anger and hate.

486
00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.635
I... I don't want that
to be my legacy.

487
00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.154
- This is all on me.
- No.

488
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.913
All of it.

489
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.190
My mistake.

490
00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.318
And I'm not gonna
make another one.

491
00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.996
Sometimes all you can do
is live with the consequences.

492
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.519
Nora...

493
00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:07.714
Oh. my god.

494
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.440
It's okay. It's okay.

495
00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.798
It's okay.

496
00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.995
We love you.

497
00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.834
Thank you
for everything.

498
00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.435
No...

499
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.159
We're so sorry.

500
00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.597
We have to believe
that we'll see her again.

501
00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.111
We will.

502
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.360
Nora...

503
00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.478
made sure that we didn't
lose everything tonight.

504
00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.438
She saved every meta
in the city.

505
00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.432
And she gave Grace
a new future.

506
00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.954
Gave all of us. right?

507
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.156
Especially me.

508
00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.516
Without Nora.
I never would've met

509
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.080
the love of my life. Renee.

510
00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.834
And you wouldn't
have stopped your 38th Cicada.

511
00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.116
Or your 39th.

512
00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.910
Right.

513
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.514
It's been quite
a journey.

514
00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.999
Pleasure.

515
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.515
An honor. Flash.

516
00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.115
We never could've solved
this mystery without you.

517
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.476
Well. don't be too sure.

518
00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.473
You already have a master
detective in your midst.

519
00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:55.076
Congratulations. Adult Giraffe.

520
00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.757
Well done. Sherloque.

521
00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.519
Sherlock.

522
00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.720
Well. all right then.

523
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.757
Without further ado...

524
00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:18.637
<i>Mes amis.</i>

525
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.473
Good luck. Team Flash.

526
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.000
It's Singh.

527
00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.357
Yeah. he. uh... he wants us
to meet him at CCPD

528
00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.874
and bring Barry.

529
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.319
Yeah. go.

530
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.756
I kinda want
to be alone anyway.

531
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.319
Is everything okay?

532
00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.912
What Thawne said...

533
00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.918
I don't want that.

534
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.714
I don't want
the extraordinary thing

535
00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.759
about my life
to be my powers.

536
00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.710
No one feels that way.

537
00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.031
Here's the thing.

538
00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.270
I do.

539
00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:06.072
All these years
I thought that Vibe

540
00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:09.394
was the person
I was supposed to be.

541
00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.593
I think it's time Cisco
finally got his turn.

542
00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.116
So what does
that mean?

543
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.914
It means I want
to take the cure.

544
00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:36.274
- If you do this...
- There's no going back.

545
00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.750
I know.

546
00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.720
Killer Frost and I
are really gonna miss Vibe.

547
00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:04.960
Me too.

548
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.354
How do you feel?

549
00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.912
Scared.

550
00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.076
But I'm hopeful.

551
00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.272
Before I forget.

552
00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.114
I left you something
in the workshop.

553
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:56.320
Just. you know.
my way of saying thank you.

554
00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.520
For what?

555
00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.193
For being a great friend.

556
00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.197
Well. Grace Gibbons
is currently scheduled

557
00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.496
to meet with our
county counselor.

558
00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.056
and as soon as possible.
we'll get her in

559
00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.833
with a good foster family.

560
00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.957
Look. I won't
keep you long.

561
00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.554
but I just wanted
to thank you

562
00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.160
for being at the forefront
with Cicada.

563
00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.072
Just doing
our job. sir.

564
00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.756
Well. you went way beyond
just doing your job.

565
00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.196
And I know you did it
because of how much

566
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.351
you care for
the people of this city.

567
00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:47.719
which is how I know I can leave
it in your capable hands.

568
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.598
What do you mean.
leave it?

569
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.195
The mayor's
offered me the job

570
00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.000
as the new
chief of police.

571
00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.116
What?

572
00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.554
- David.
- David.

573
00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.438
- Congratulations.
- That's great.

574
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.751
Thank you. thanks.

575
00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.752
Of course that leaves me
responsible for finding

576
00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.433
my own replacement.

577
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.115
And. uh...

578
00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.920
I would like that
to be you. Joe.

579
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.311
Re... replace you?

580
00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.033
As... as captain?

581
00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.918
Captain Joe West.

582
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.639
Oh. I like
the sound of that.

583
00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.393
And don't worry.

584
00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.995
If things get dicey.
as they tend to around here.

585
00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.720
you'll have
plenty of help.

586
00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.200
Isn't that right. Flash?

587
00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.717
But... wait. I'm not...

588
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.200
Oh. come on. Barry.

589
00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.555
I'm a detective too.

590
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.278
Sir.

591
00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:43.755
Congratulations.

592
00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:44.840
I'll do my best.

593
00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.235
Hey.

594
00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.519
Now I know what my dad
meant when he said

595
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.200
being a parent is like
wearing your heart

596
00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.516
on the outside
of your body.

597
00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.319
Yeah.

598
00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.437
Thawne got away.

599
00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:24.080
Again.

600
00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:28.040
Nora's gone.

601
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.152
It should feel
like a loss but.

602
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.319
I also feel...

603
00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.995
- Pride?
- Pride. yeah.

604
00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.430
She did good.

605
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.633
Yeah.

606
00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.919
She was the best
of both of us.

607
00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.755
She was my legacy
all along.

608
00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:00.754
And us. together.
as a family.

609
00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.917
that's how I want
to be remembered.

610
00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.439
As a good man.

611
00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.877
a loving husband...

612
00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.679
a supportive father.

613
00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:17.035
You're already
all of those things.

614
00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.760
Nora felt that way too.

615
00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.278
- Time language.
- Mm-hmm.

616
00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.919
No matter what changes
with the timeline.

617
00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.280
that'll never change.

618
00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.714
Yeah.

619
00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.233
We'll always have this
to remember her.

620
00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.670
<i>Hi. Mom and Dad.</i>

621
00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.353
<i>If you're watching this.</i>

622
00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:16.274
<i>it means that
something went wrong.</i>

623
00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.750
<i>But I don't want you
guys to be sad.</i>

624
00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.433
<i>I'm not.</i>

625
00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:24.230
<i>I always wanted
to be a hero.</i>

626
00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.916
<i>to use my extraordinary
abilities to help people.</i>

627
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.639
<i>That's why I came here:</i>

628
00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.958
<i>To meet my family.
stop Cicada.</i>

629
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.396
<i>help fix the Flash's legacy.</i>

630
00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.712
<i>and save him from
disappearing in the future.</i>

631
00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.633
<i>I believed I could
do the impossible.</i>

632
00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:47.598
<i>but I never imagined
it would turn out like this.</i>

633
00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.115
<i>I'm glad it did.</i>

634
00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.471
<i>I wouldn't
change anything</i>

635
00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.995
<i>about my time with you.</i>

636
00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.840
<i>my sweet parents.</i>

637
00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:01.516
<i>the most important people
to me in the world.</i>

638
00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:09.080
<i>I wish I could be there
to celebrate every new chapter.</i>

639
00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:12.551
<i>to witness every success.</i>

640
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.398
<i>Just know...</i>

641
00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.949
<i>that no matter where
I go in my life.</i>

642
00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:25.554
<i>you'll always
be my side.</i>

643
00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.279
<i>Because of you.</i>

644
00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:37.640
<i>I know I will never.
ever. truly be alone.</i>

645
00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:43.520
<i>and I will feel your love
and support like a warm hug</i>

646
00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.557
<i>comforting me.</i>

647
00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.552
<i>wishing me to be the best
person I can be.</i>

648
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:55.117
<i>Thank you
for everything...</i>

649
00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:00.556
<i>For making me a hero</i>

650
