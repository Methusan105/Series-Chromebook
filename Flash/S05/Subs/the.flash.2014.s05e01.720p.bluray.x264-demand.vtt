<i>Last season. on</i> The Flash.

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.274
Melt.

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.473
<i>- Killer Frost...</i>
- Is gone.

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.598
It says there's still another
cryogenic anomaly in my DNA.

5
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.936
Killer Frost
is still a part of you.

6
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.713
Hang on.

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.598
<i>That's me. right there.</i>

8
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.637
<i>Killer Frost.
she was part of you.</i>

9
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.393
<i>Even then.</i>

10
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.800
How is that possible?

11
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.792
To the newest member
of Team Flash.

12
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.996
- Hi.
- Hey.

13
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.230
We need to talk.

14
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.357
- Who are you?
- I'm your daughter. Nora.

15
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.800
<i>Sally's in a decaying orbit.</i>

16
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.296
<i>Okay. how do we
stop something</i>

17
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.016
that's going to send us
back into the Stone Age?

18
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.776
<i>Barry. you've got
to destroy that satellite.</i>

19
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.510
<i>That satellite...</i>

20
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.478
<i>it wasn'tjust me
who took it down.</i>

21
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.637
<i>There was another speedster.</i>

22
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.951
<i>Okay. let's back up.</i>

23
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.038
<i>My name is Nora West-Allen.</i>

24
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.918
<i>the fastest woman alive.</i>

25
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.957
<i>When I'm from.
30 years from now.</i>

26
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.157
<i>I'm the guardian
of Central City.</i>

27
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.034
<i>I'm a speedster.
just like my dad.</i>

28
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.157
<i>People call me XS.</i>

29
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.840
<i>Every day. I hope to live up
to the legacy of The Flash...</i>

30
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.877
<i>But I've still got
a long way to go.</i>

31
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.760
You're saying
you're our daughter?

32
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.196
From the future?

33
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.919
Named Nora?

34
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.196
After your mother.

35
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.034
Anybody need a refill?

36
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.718
No?
Just me?

37
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.709
Mm.

38
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.154
<i>Cisco Ramon.</i>

39
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.476
always cutting the tension
with a joke.

40
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.194
You know our names?

41
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.431
Of course.
I know all of you.

42
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.876
You're Caitlin Snow.
Ralph Dibny.

43
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.191
Papa Joe. Mama Cecile.

44
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.680
Little Auntie Jenna.

45
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.910
She's so cute.

46
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.195
And Uncle Wally.

47
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.875
Uh. and your nickname is XS?

48
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.440
Clearly not my doing.

49
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.000
No. uh. it's a nickname

50
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.437
that you gave me
when I was a kid. Mom.

51
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.079
"Mom"?

52
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.119
You said I did
everything in excess.

53
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.396
Guess I've always
been like that.

54
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.035
Overdoing things.
getting in way over my head.

55
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.157
Like. uh. recently.

56
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.879
This mistake that you made?

57
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.076
Big mistake.

58
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.514
Which was...

59
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.034
Helping you save the city

60
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.430
by destroying the STAR Labs
satellite last night.

61
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.749
You were the other speedster?

62
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.115
I just couldn't
stop myself

63
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.396
from getting involved.

64
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.120
But something happened
when I did. because now.

65
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.113
I can't seem to go fast enough
to open up the Speed Force.

66
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.634
Par... pardon me.

67
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.916
Are we talking about
actual time travel here?

68
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.560
Do you just like.
not pay any attention

69
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.040
when we have our briefings?

70
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.998
Y'all didn't teach him
about the Legends?

71
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.311
Look. nobody said bubkes
about time travel.

72
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.874
Shh. shh. shh. Oh!

73
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.096
Come on. Ralph.
You're scaring the baby.

74
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.176
<i>Yeah. you're scaring the baby.</i>

75
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.519
No. no. she's not scared.

76
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.954
She just said she's hungry.

77
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.751
She said that she's...
Joe!

78
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.160
I heard her!

79
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.476
<i>I read her mind!</i>

80
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.597
I might not
be losing my powers!

81
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.718
I might not be losing
my powers!

82
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.519
Awesome.

83
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.353
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

84
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.160
I know how bizarre
this must seem.

85
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.757
meeting your daughter
from the future as an adult.

86
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.951
But really. this wasn't
my plan at all.

87
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.839
but I'm kind of stuck here now.

88
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.196
and you're the only people
who can help me.

89
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.320
So... anybody know what to do?

90
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.275
This is so. so weird.

91
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.118
Yeah. I mean. I can't believe
that's our daughter up there.

92
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.557
- We have been lied to before.
- Barry.

93
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.599
Yellow lightning like yours.
purple lightning like mine?

94
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.717
I mean. it's...
it's got to be her.

95
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.435
We're meeting our daughter
for the first time. Barry.

96
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.273
Yeah. well. look.
If it is true. Nora

97
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.398
could say the wrong thing
or step on the wrong butterfly

98
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.153
and screw up
the whole timeline.

99
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.336
I mean. she could Marty McFly
herself out of existence.

100
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.431
Mm. <i>Terminator 2.</i> yeah.

101
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.118
No. that's <i>Back to the...</i>
It doesn't matter.

102
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.192
Look. we just need to
be responsible. all right?

103
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.456
I mean. I think we need to find
a way to send her home. fast.

104
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.676
Barry. don't you think
future us taught our daughter

105
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.558
how not to screw
with the timeline?

106
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.836
Wow. this Speed Lab
sure is archaic. huh?

107
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.354
La-la-la-la-la.
you don't know...

108
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.999
you know what. um...

109
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.656
Sorry. just... no future talk.
all right. please?

110
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.149
Right. I don't want
to wreck the timeline.

111
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.471
- Right.
- All right. Nora.

112
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.392
This is gonna link us up
with your biometrics.

113
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.834
Ow!

114
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.276
And this little
scrunchy doohicky

115
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.558
is gonna analyze your
connection to the. um. uh...

116
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.790
The Speed Force.

117
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.599
The Speed Force.
Thank you.

118
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.716
Great.

119
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.757
I'll be back in a... flash.

120
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.714
And what does it say?

121
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.439
A quick analysis
of her DNA shows

122
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.671
patterns that are similar
to both of yours.

123
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.400
I knew it.
She's our daughter.

124
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.233
What about her
being stuck here?

125
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.549
Everything's normal.

126
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.677
She definitely has
Speed Force in her system.

127
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.877
She's just not going...
fast enough

128
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.674
to. uh. open up
a time portal. so.

129
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.480
How much champagne did you
have at Joe and Cecile's?

130
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.519
This is the first
opportunity I have

131
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.832
to process my breakup
with Gypsy. okay?

132
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.354
<i>How was I supposed to know</i>

133
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.874
that your future daughter

134
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.553
was gonna come show up

135
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.994
and crash my pity party?

136
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.833
<i>How was I supposed
to "ancipitate" that?</i>

137
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.080
Crap. I was supposed
to meet Singh

138
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.640
- at CCPD an hour ago.
- Okay.

139
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.074
Hey. Wally. can you
do me a favor?

140
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.456
Can you take the sample
to the Legends

141
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.656
to see if they
have any insight?

142
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.920
And maybe.
worst comes to worst.

143
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.056
we can take her home
on the Waverider?

144
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.355
- Yeah. I got it.
- All right.

145
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.960
Okay. just...
I'll hurry back.

146
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.594
Keep an eye on her.

147
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.915
<i>New ID. keys to the lab.</i>

148
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.595
You are officially reinstated
as our CSI tech. Allen.

149
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.040
Thanks. Captain.

150
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.510
Oh. one more thing.

151
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.896
We didn't fill your position
while you were away.

152
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.276
so there are a few cases
waiting for you in your lab.

153
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.597
<i>Get to them fast as you can.</i>

154
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.034
<i>Welcome back. Allen.</i>

155
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.311
"A few"?

156
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.840
- Ahh!
- What you working on?

157
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.152
- I don't...
- You are crazy behind.

158
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.240
Hey. so I thought you were
gonna stay at STAR Labs.

159
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.710
with. um... with your...

160
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.598
Iris... mom.

161
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.353
With your mom.

162
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.159
You know
I'm a forensic scientist too?

163
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.153
CCU grad. just like you.
5.6 GPA.

164
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.754
I could help you
get through this.

165
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.718
Oh. I don't know.
I mean. it's...

166
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.953
So the fire marshal
at this site says

167
00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.431
crazing in the melted glass
suggests a liquid accelerant.

168
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.194
Mm. any petroleum-based
household product

169
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.112
could cause crazing.

170
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.034
Well. like floor wax.
or shag rugs. even balloons.

171
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.874
Yeah. the glass
melts under the surface.

172
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.000
like ice cream in the cracks
of a waffle cone.

173
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.271
Oh. like when
you get two scoops

174
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.636
of cookie dough ice cream
with extra sprinkles

175
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.552
<i>at the Mason Family
Ice Cream Shop in...</i>

176
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.791
Happy Harbor. Rhode Island.

177
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.349
My parents used to
take me there when I was a kid.

178
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.473
It's my favorite dessert.

179
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.795
Mine too.

180
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.433
Hey. look. I'm sorry.
um. you're obviously

181
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.194
good at forensics.
but you shouldn't interfere.

182
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.433
I mean. people like us.
we need to be responsible.

183
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.796
Right! Uh. timeline.

184
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.996
The timeline. yeah.

185
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.480
<i>All available units.</i>

186
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.119
<i>M-0-3 in progress.
10th and Neely.</i>

187
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.112
M-0-3. that's a meta attack.

188
00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.600
Yeah. my suit's all torn up.

189
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.273
I don't have anything to...

190
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.317
Direct from Cisco's
back closet.

191
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.518
One first-edition
red emblem OG super suit.

192
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.432
Total fan favorite.

193
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.159
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

194
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.755
Uh. I'm...
I'm gonna handle this.

195
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.840
You just... no. no. no.

196
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.118
Uh. you... stay.

197
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.429
- Okay?
- Okay.

198
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.000
Seriously. please.

199
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.276
Now I'm gonna...

200
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.119
Going old-school
today. Flash?

201
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.590
Yeah. it's a little tighter
than I remember. though.

202
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.712
Hey. uh. you might
want to do something.

203
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.156
Now it's my turn. Flash.

204
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.718
Gridlock? Schway!

205
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.029
- What are you doing?
<i>- No. no.</i>

206
00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.077
I just... I just wanted...

207
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.280
Nice.

208
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.156
Oh. grife.
You're mad at me.

209
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.596
No. Nora. we're not.
We're just...

210
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.239
Please don't say
"disappointed."

211
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.800
That's so much worse.

212
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.576
I mean. I just didn't think
it was a big deal.

213
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.273
It was only Gridlock.

214
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.680
Oh. Gridlock. huh?

215
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.399
Boy. the future's got some
great names.

216
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.835
This lighting!

217
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.593
How did you know
who he is?

218
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.796
Flash Museum.

219
00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.712
Did you say...

220
00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.200
- "Flash Museum"?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

221
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.751
It has all the villains and
battles in chronological order.

222
00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.399
I've studied everything.

223
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.199
So you know this guy's
real name?

224
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.033
Mr. Myles. the curator.

225
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.396
he scrubbed all the names
for legal reasons.

226
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.755
But it really shouldn't matter.

227
00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.236
I mean. Gridlock
was a one-and-done.

228
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.277
You guys beat him in one try.

229
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.875
or at least...
you were supposed to.

230
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.350
Ugh. now. because of me.
he's on the run.

231
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.955
and the timeline's
all messed up again. and I...

232
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.520
Nora. hey. look. look.

233
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.718
I've made way bigger mistakes
than this time traveling.

234
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.696
We'll get this guy... you don't
need to worry about that...

235
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.496
but the longer you stay here.
the more things might change.

236
00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.795
We need to get you home.

237
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.111
But I can't go fast enough
to get home.

238
00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.358
What about the tachyon
absorption enhancer?

239
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.056
The one that Thawne used
to increase his speed?

240
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.753
Ooh. and if we charge it up.

241
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.877
we could uh. boost
the Speed Force in her cells.

242
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.156
like some kind of. um...

243
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.799
thing that boosts
Speed Force in cells.

244
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.376
<i>Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.
That's a good idea.</i>

245
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.993
Let's... okay.
finding Gridlock

246
00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.960
and getting Nora home
need to be our priorities.

247
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.430
No. no. no.
Stop. stop. stop. stop. stop.

248
00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.000
- Wait.
- Loud!

249
00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.154
Okay. so... but this
needs to be our priority.

250
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.072
<i>Now. I realize that
you're all way ahead of me</i>

251
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.753
in this time-travel business.
but guys.

252
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.136
I think I just
discovered something.

253
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.231
So if... if Nora can time travel.

254
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.597
that means she can create
new timelines. right?

255
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.357
New timelines means that
parallel timelines can exist.

256
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:24.676
So. guys. I think that a whole
other universe could exist.

257
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.114
<i>I know. I know. I know.</i>

258
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.416
<i>It sounds crazy.
but think about it.</i>

259
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.353
There could be an Earth
where we're all bad guys.

260
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.114
or another Earth where
there's no world hunger.

261
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.079
or... or another Earth where...

262
00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.039
where they never made that
last "Indiana Jones" movie.

263
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.359
Think of the possibilities.

264
00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.511
It's like some kind
of a manyverse.

265
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.878
And everybody knows
about the manyverse.

266
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.112
Multiverse.
and so do you. Ralph.

267
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.590
Breacher? Gypsy? Harry?

268
00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.816
What did you think we meant
when we said

269
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.399
Harry was from Earth-2?

270
00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.552
That he is from Earth "also."

271
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.960
Oh. my God.

272
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.616
You guys really need to make.
like. a welcome pamphlet.

273
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.597
or at least a PowerPoint
or something.

274
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.353
<i>Hey. Ralph. buddy?</i>

275
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.591
Can we get off time travel.
maybe. please?

276
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.336
Let's focus on finding
Gridlock. all right?

277
00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.430
Thank you.

278
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.590
I'm gonna go to CCPD.

279
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.034
see what I can dig up.

280
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.236
Okay. I'll stay with Nora.

281
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.152
- Let's just make sure...
- I know.

282
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.152
Protect the timeline.

283
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.318
You thirsty?

284
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.230
Okay. latte for me.
and a decaf Flash for you.

285
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.039
Wow.

286
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.635
Dad's lightning bolt is way
cooler than Lightning Lad's.

287
00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.877
And do you think
he's gonna be back soon?

288
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.633
Well. you know your dad.

289
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.235
Whenever there's a problem.
he's gotta run off and fix it.

290
00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.840
But. you know.

291
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.391
this gives us
a chance to connect.

292
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.195
You're not worried about
messing things up. like he is?

293
00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.114
I... well. I just. I...

294
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.680
want to get to know you
a little.

295
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.676
How about this?

296
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.553
I will ask you questions

297
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.474
about your life.
and if I'm right.

298
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.280
you just blink twice.

299
00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.670
I mean. blinking never
broke the timeline. right?

300
00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.991
Okay. yeah. I mean.
if you really want to.

301
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.992
Yeah. I think
it'll be really fun.

302
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.356
Okay. um. so let's see.

303
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.673
You are a reporter
for a newspaper

304
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.320
that you can only read
on Instagram.

305
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.672
Um. okay. you... you are a cop.

306
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.595
You're a... a CSI?

307
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.837
You're a CSI.

308
00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.754
Just like your dad.

309
00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.355
Okay. well.
what about you and I?

310
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.080
Do we... do we. like.
have dinner every Sunday?

311
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.514
Do we talk on the phone?

312
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.438
Do we still get coffee
at Jitters?

313
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.717
- Uh...
- Was that a blink?

314
00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.157
Uh. no. I just...
I have something in my eye.

315
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.034
You know. a coffee in my time
at Jitters is $43 a cup.

316
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.236
- Wow.
- That's one thing

317
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.470
I really like about now.

318
00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.517
2018 is way schway.

319
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.398
- "Schway"?
- Oh.

320
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.312
Yeah. I guess it's
a future thing.

321
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.835
Oh... oh. no. Oh. "schway."

322
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.656
No. I know. I'm hip.
I know what schway means.

323
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.036
Like. I'm schway.
you're schway.

324
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.589
We're... we're schway. baby.

325
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.479
Stupid.

326
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.280
Do you think maybe Caitlin
and Cisco need any help?

327
00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.836
I can't believe I'm wearing
the same tachyon enhancer

328
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.276
my dad used to meet Supergirl
for the first time.

329
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.880
All set.

330
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.520
Wait. what happened
to the second version?

331
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.056
The smaller one that was
inside the emblem

332
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.878
of my dad's second suit?

333
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.077
Um. if he wore that one.
he could harness tachyons

334
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.270
and share them with me.

335
00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.192
Hey. fangirl. relax.

336
00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.475
We know.

337
00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.392
Did all these suits shrink?

338
00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.551
And why does it smell so bad?

339
00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.438
Because it's the one you used

340
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.751
when you swam against
King Shark.

341
00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.360
Oh. yeah. yeah.

342
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.954
Flash!

343
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.190
Zoom wants you dead!

344
00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.919
Yeah. yeah.

345
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.798
I know King Shark
is technically a bad guy.

346
00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.917
but you should see...
just wait.

347
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.878
- When he fights Grodd. it's...
- Um!

348
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.440
Spoiler alert.

349
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.998
We should get going.
actually. let's...

350
00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.080
Right.

351
00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.595
Then this is goodbye.

352
00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.798
From your guys'
perspectives. at least.

353
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.873
I'll see you again
in a minute and 27 seconds.

354
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.714
but when you see me again.
I'll be a baby.

355
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.314
Get home safe. Nora.

356
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.629
I'm sorry

357
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.473
we didn't get to spend
more time together.

358
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.560
Oh. it's fine. Mom.

359
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.199
We spend our
whole lives together.

360
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.070
All right.

361
00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.835
Did they already leave?

362
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.149
Yeah. why?
What's up?

363
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.390
We have to stop them.

364
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.074
I'm sorry I was too late.

365
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.616
<i>It took me a while to find
where the Legends were.</i>

366
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.869
Well. when they were.

367
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.440
<i>But we got their Gideon</i>

368
00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.079
to scan Nora's blood sample.

369
00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.437
- What'd she find?
- Negative tachyons.

370
00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.352
Negative tachyons?

371
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.750
So. what. instead of speeding
you up. they slow you down?

372
00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.680
Yeah.

373
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.240
Oh. damn. I was just joking.

374
00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.595
That's a real thing?

375
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.280
Yeah. Ava and her team
at the Time Bureau

376
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.896
have encountered them before.
but no one knows

377
00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.832
where they come from
or how they're generated.

378
00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.640
Like dark matter
for the space time continuum.

379
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.195
Exactly. and they're
saturating Nora's body

380
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.080
and keeping her from
entering the Speed Force.

381
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.595
What about the Waverider?
Can the Legends take her back?

382
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.239
If negative tachyons
come anywhere near

383
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.674
the Rider's time drives.

384
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.831
uh. the reaction
will vaporize the ship.

385
00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.456
Well. there's got to be a way
to get rid of them. right?

386
00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.856
I mean. I don't know
about getting rid of them.

387
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.872
but maybe we can offset

388
00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.872
the tachyon
absorption enhancer

389
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.111
to negate the reaction somehow.

390
00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.296
<i>A new meta
was last seen...</i>

391
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.320
Hey. guys.

392
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.656
<i>Jumping off a building
in order to</i>

393
00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.353
<i>evade capture
after stealing...</i>

394
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.669
How did we miss this?

395
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.671
I guess this is a parting gift
from DeVoe.

396
00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.176
Without our STAR Labs
satellite. we've lost

397
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.396
our eyes. our ears.
our dark matter scanner.

398
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.136
our facial recognition...
I mean. we're always

399
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.760
gonna be one step
behind these metas now.

400
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:55.956
I'll work on this.

401
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.176
Why don't you guys
go help Ralph

402
00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.296
with the Gridlock
crime scene. okay?

403
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.040
- Uh. I can come help.
- Please. no. just...

404
00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.112
we just can't let this
get any worse. all right?

405
00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.879
Just relax. okay?

406
00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.879
How's your
investigation going?

407
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.679
Uh. it just
doesn't really add up.

408
00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.856
I mean. if Eddie wanted to
erase Thawne from existence.

409
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.520
why didn't he just
have a vasectomy?

410
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.478
Right. uh.
nobody's talking.

411
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.096
<i>Probably because
they're afraid</i>

412
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.554
<i>Gridlock will attack them.</i>

413
00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.871
Right. but maybe if I had
Killer Frost at my side.

414
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.336
people would be
a little more willing

415
00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.953
to tell us what they know.

416
00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.396
Ralph. Killer Frost
has been gone

417
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.836
since the night that DeVoe
took over your body.

418
00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.594
Jeez Louise.
no one tells me anything.

419
00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.353
- Is she gone for good?
- I hope not.

420
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.079
But I've tried everything
I can think of

421
00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.435
to get her to reappear.

422
00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.113
You don't have
any other leads?

423
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.119
Cisco vibed me back to when

424
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.237
Killer Frost and I
were younger.

425
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.880
You've been a meta
since you were a kid?

426
00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.440
- I guess so.
- How?

427
00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.989
- I have no idea.
- Did you see anything else?

428
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.914
- Just that my dad was there.
- Well. that's something.

429
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.832
Except my dad's
been dead for years.

430
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.513
But none of this
matters right now.

431
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.638
We have much more pressing
things to deal with.

432
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.632
<i>Hey. come look at this.</i>

433
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.279
<i>I present Gridlock.</i>

434
00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.359
A mystery in three acts.

435
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.800
Please note
the dark matter levels.

436
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.396
Act One. Gridlock attacks the
cops before Barry shows up.

437
00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.736
Okay. but these
dark matter levels

438
00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.216
are perfectly normal
for a man of his size.

439
00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.312
Until Act Two.

440
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.790
He gets lightning punched
by Barry.

441
00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.633
His dark matter levels
increased.

442
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.599
Which brings us
to our third and final act...

443
00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.034
Gridlock hits back.

444
00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.236
Even higher.

445
00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.754
How... how is that possible?

446
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.400
It isn't. unless every time
Gridlock got hit.

447
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.676
his cells absorbed
the kinetic energy.

448
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.256
That would increase
his dark matter quotient.

449
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.033
thereby increasing his powers.

450
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.557
If this is true. then whatever
movement he's exposed to...

451
00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.994
The stronger he's gonna get.

452
00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.830
So. if Gridlock keeps moving.
he becomes unstoppable.

453
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.035
So. figure it out yet?

454
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.713
Whatever these negative
tachyons are.

455
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.296
it feels a lot more
like science fiction

456
00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.720
than actual science.

457
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.632
I wasn't asking
about the science.

458
00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.315
I was asking about
the scientist.

459
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.759
You and Nora. you guys
have such a strong connection.

460
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.435
I mean. it's...
it's effortless.

461
00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.991
So why are you so intent
on sending her back?

462
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.515
I mean. what do you mean?

463
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.576
First of all. she can't
stop talking about the future.

464
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.594
But... I mean. you know
the danger that her being here

465
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.034
poses to the timeline.

466
00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.796
Yeah. I do.
but I also know you. Barry.

467
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.391
Look.

468
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.439
You're the guy
that went back in time

469
00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.760
to borrow Snart before he died.

470
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:44.800
I know.

471
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.440
You're also the same guy
that travelled to 2020

472
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.275
to figure out who Savitar was.
and 2015 to train with Wells.

473
00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:56.151
You changed fate
to save my life.

474
00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.675
So. now that our daughter
is here in front of us.

475
00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.672
asking for our help.
you expect me to believe

476
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.433
that you're worried
about the timeline?

477
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.637
Nora shouldn't be here.

478
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.480
Look. I'm...

479
00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.598
- I've always wanted a family.
- I know.

480
00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.433
You know. and when
we got married.

481
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.560
I knew that one day.
we'd decide to have a baby.

482
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:20.476
We would try.
and you'd get pregnant.

483
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.270
I'd be there for the sonogram.
I'd hear her first heartbeat.

484
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.079
and then she'd come.

485
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.870
And we'd take her home.
see her first smile.

486
00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.873
her first tooth.
the first time I read to her.

487
00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.956
Her first steps.
The first time she ran.

488
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.679
But her being here now.
don't you feel like

489
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.433
we missed all those firsts?

490
00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.034
That we skipped
all the good stuff?

491
00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.670
Baby. we will still have
all of those firsts.

492
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.752
Just not in that order.

493
00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.071
But my whole life's
been out of order.

494
00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.436
These powers. time travel...

495
00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.796
that's the reason
my mom was killed.

496
00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.076
why I grew up
with my dad in prison.

497
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.470
They missed so many firsts.
They missed our wedding.

498
00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.199
I know.

499
00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.960
I don't know. I just thought
that when it was our turn

500
00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.556
to have a kid.
that life would let us

501
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.872
have this one little thing
the normal way.

502
00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.191
Just once.

503
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.078
But we lost that chance.

504
00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:26.200
No. we're not losing anything
by having her here now.

505
00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.119
We're only gaining
something extra. Barry.

506
00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:33.075
And look.
if we figure this out.

507
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.879
I mean. by the time
we do have a baby.

508
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.079
we are gonna be
the best parents ever.

509
00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.959
- Maybe you're right.
- I know I'm right.

510
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.194
You're gonna be there to put
that quarter under her pillow.

511
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.714
and you're gonna be there

512
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.837
to drive her to her
first day of school.

513
00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:56.153
and you're gonna be there
to cheer on her first run.

514
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.436
And we are gonna have
all of those firsts.

515
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.160
I promise.

516
00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.471
And think about it.

517
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:12.032
We have a kid
who defied the laws of physics

518
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.753
to hang out with her parents.

519
00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.799
I mean. that's pretty...
that's pretty schway.

520
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.115
Yeah. as eager as she is.
you'd think that she's the one

521
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.194
that grew up
with a parent in...

522
00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.398
What's wrong?

523
00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.517
Nothing.
Um. nothing.

524
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.353
I'm... I'm gonna be right back.

525
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.312
<i>Nora.</i>

526
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.115
Um...

527
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.874
What happens to me
in the future?

528
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.754
You said that you spend
your whole life with your mom.

529
00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:06.470
but you didn't
say the same for me.

530
00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.155
My poker face
is that bad. huh?

531
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.550
I need to know.

532
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.912
How long?

533
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.991
You never come back.

534
00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.714
How old were you
when it happened?

535
00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.316
I was born. um. a few years
before you vanished.

536
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:04.360
but I don't have
any memories of you.

537
00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.597
So the wedding was...

538
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.593
Was pretty much
the first time I met you.

539
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:13.230
I'd imagined so many
different things to say to you.

540
00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.880
Still can't believe I went with
"Remember to say 'I do.'"

541
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.433
I guess things don't always
go the way you plan them.

542
00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.917
You're not stuck here.
are you?

543
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.480
I found it
in the museum archive.

544
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.997
Negative tachyons.
harnessed on demand.

545
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:44.313
Really should work
on that poker face. I guess.

546
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.834
This didn't have to
be a secret.

547
00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.639
Why did you keep this from us?

548
00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.871
Because if you knew
I could have gone home.

549
00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.235
you would have sent me back

550
00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.272
the second I walked
into Grandpa's house.

551
00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.760
<i>I mean.
it's like you said. Dad.</i>

552
00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.832
<i>Speedsters have
to be responsible.</i>

553
00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.314
But... but I'm
not responsible. am I?

554
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.076
I'm... just selfish

555
00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:09.838
and really. really bad
at being a speedster.

556
00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.474
Nora. you're not bad.

557
00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.520
I mean. I can do
some cool things. you know?

558
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.399
Sometimes. I run so fast.
I reverse time a bit.

559
00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.075
but I can't do
the things you can.

560
00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.991
I don't even know
how to phase yet.

561
00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:35.198
Guess there's only so much
you can learn from a museum.

562
00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.031
What about your mom?

563
00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.830
Yeah. I... she's around.
you know?

564
00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.958
It's just. uh...
just me and her.

565
00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.514
I'm sorry.

566
00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.478
Yeah. I know.

567
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.119
I shouldn't have lied.

568
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:54.750
I just wanted
to see you so badly

569
00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.111
and spend a day with you.

570
00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:02.673
Go for a run
for the first time together.

571
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.116
I missed all your firsts.

572
00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.232
I was so worried about
screwing up your childhood

573
00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.996
and screwing up
our family. but...

574
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.958
I'm not even there.

575
00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.559
<i>Barry. we need you
in the Cortex.</i>

576
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.791
<i>It's about Gridlock.</i>

577
00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.600
- I...
- I'm fine. Um...

578
00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:30.435
you need to go fix my mess.
and then I can go home.

579
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.960
I scanned the crime scene
photos and got a match.

580
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.117
This is not Lang's first rodeo.

581
00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.999
CCPD put out a warrant
for him for carjacking.

582
00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.434
He killed
the whole crew inside.

583
00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.074
And now he absorbs
kinetic energy?

584
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.913
He only gets stronger
if you punch him.

585
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.673
you shoot him.
you throw him into traffic.

586
00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.136
Which could only
make the traffic worse.

587
00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.958
God. I'd hate to be stuck
in that gridlock.

588
00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.636
Gridlock... Gridlock...

589
00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.996
I came up with the name.

590
00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.879
I am fortune's fool.

591
00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.920
So how do we find this guy
without Sally the satellite?

592
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.999
We don't need a satellite
to hack a cell phone.

593
00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.673
And if we want to find his
cell phone. we'll find it...

594
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.994
By the airport?

595
00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.040
Got it. 'cause he's on a plane
that just took off.

596
00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.794
Central City Air.
flight number 5201.

597
00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.237
Why would he get on a plane?

598
00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.073
Because he's gonna crash it.

599
00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.277
<i>We are currently cruising
at 34.000 feet.</i>

600
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.874
<i>We anticipate
a smooth flight.</i>

601
00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.030
<i>so sit back and enjoy...</i>

602
00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.833
Excuse me. sir.

603
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.513
If you could please
fasten your seatbelt

604
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.840
until we reach
cruising altitude

605
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.076
and the captain turns off
the seatbelt sign.

606
00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.872
Are you gonna buckle
that thing in too?

607
00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.960
Well. it must be
something priceless

608
00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.430
to get its own seat.

609
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.512
Jewels. maybe.

610
00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.200
The plane just lost
an engine.

611
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.391
It's headed for downtown.

612
00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.278
If Gridlock takes out
the other engine.

613
00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.856
the pilot won't be able
to avoid the buildings.

614
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.593
Thousands of people will die.

615
00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.030
Not if you phase the plane
through the buildings.

616
00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.918
I read about you
doing the same thing

617
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.311
to a plane in the future
when you were fighting Mob Rule.

618
00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.199
Can you two do that?

619
00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.112
A plane?

620
00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.839
No... I mean. no.
I don't think so.

621
00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.080
I mean. I think it's too big.

622
00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.319
The three of us.

623
00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.056
I mean. the three of us
might be able to do it.

624
00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.673
No. I can't phase anything.

625
00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:13.912
I can't even phase myself.
let alone at G-Force.

626
00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.111
Wait. G-For...
G-Force. that's it.

627
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.793
The plane is still ascending.

628
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.200
Once he blows up
the other engine.

629
00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.311
it's gonna slow down
and point downwards

630
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.595
before it starts its descent.

631
00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.034
That'll give us
about ten seconds

632
00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.873
- of zero Gs on the plane.
- Yeah.

633
00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.216
And zero Gs
means no kinetic energy.

634
00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.720
means Gridlock has no powers.

635
00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.553
Can you breach them
onto the plane?

636
00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.796
A plane goes way too fast.

637
00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.200
I'd need to see it in person.

638
00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.839
- Then go.
- But I don't have a suit.

639
00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.559
I actually have a backup.

640
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.632
I got more than just a list
of metas from that museum.

641
00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.076
Damn. Gina. I made that?

642
00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.992
Uh. Ryan Choi. actually.

643
00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.720
Oh. this is a supersuit.

644
00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.752
- No offense.
- None taken.

645
00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.256
Guys. he just took out
the other engine.

646
00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.560
You can do this.

647
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:36.277
Uh. don't drink and vibe.
I feel like I'm gonna hurl.

648
00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.670
It's slowing.

649
00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.353
Guys. you've got
ten seconds.

650
00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.393
<i>Ten.</i>

651
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.199
<i>Nine.</i>

652
00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.634
Eight.

653
00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.513
Seven.

654
00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.120
<i>Six.</i>

655
00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.476
<i>Five.</i>

656
00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.831
<i>Four.</i>

657
00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.196
<i>Three.</i>

658
00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.158
<i>Two.</i>

659
00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.276
<i>One.</i>

660
00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.511
Okay. everybody stay calm.
all right?

661
00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.637
Just stay calm.

662
00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.040
All right. come on.

663
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.832
Hey. take a wall. all right?

664
00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.111
We got this.

665
00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.800
Barry. hurry.

666
00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.315
- It's not working.
- What?

667
00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.153
I can't do this.

668
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.914
All right. yes...
listen to me. just breathe.

669
00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.274
Feel the floor
beneath your feet.

670
00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.635
Feel the rumble of the plane.

671
00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.473
Feel the air.

672
00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.791
Feel that wind on your face.

673
00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.752
<i>- and the lightning.</i>
- And the lightning.

674
00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.395
Feel its electricity
pumping through your veins.

675
00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.073
traveling to
every nerve in your body

676
00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.913
like a shock
you never want to end.

677
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.136
<i>You are no longer you now.</i>

678
00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.196
You're no longer you.

679
00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.576
<i>You're part of
something greater.</i>

680
00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.034
You're part of
something greater.

681
00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.713
Part of the Speed Force.

682
00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:23.950
That's right.

683
00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.635
All right. it's ours.

684
00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.234
Now. let's do it.

685
00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:38.036
Everybody hold on!

686
00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.235
Hold on!

687
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.712
Are you okay?

688
00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.917
Nice.

689
00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.479
You phased.

690
00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.233
For the first time!

691
00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.376
<i>Well. Gridlock's off
to Iron Heights' meta wing.</i>

692
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.711
Where he won't be moving
from for a very long time.

693
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.598
Thanks to your help.

694
00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:48.512
I'm glad we got to team up.

695
00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.875
Me too.

696
00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.553
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

697
00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:55.429
say hello to the tachyon
absorption enhancer 2.5.

698
00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.716
now complete with
completely recalibrated

699
00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.075
Time Bureau technology.

700
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.669
We haven't tested it yet.
but it should counterbalance

701
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.752
the negative tachyons
in Nora's cells.

702
00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.399
Here you go. Billy Pilgrim.

703
00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.790
Consider yourself
unstuck in time.

704
00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.599
So I can run home now?

705
00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.673
Or...

706
00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.275
maybe we hit pause
on this thing.

707
00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.829
You want Nora to stay?

708
00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.230
Um. yeah. I thought

709
00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.879
getting her home
was our priority.

710
00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.917
No. it is. I just...

711
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.196
now. I'm thinking that
maybe we should make sure

712
00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.078
her powers
are working correctly

713
00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.356
before we send her home.

714
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.949
And what about the timeline?

715
00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.360
It's risky. but I don't know.

716
00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.352
I mean. Wally and I
were talking about it.

717
00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.079
Yeah. the Legends
have a theory.

718
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.880
Uh. there are some historical
events that are soft.

719
00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.314
Basically. you change those.

720
00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.153
it's not going
to affect much else.

721
00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.754
like catching Gridlock late.

722
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.638
<i>And then. there are those
that are fixed.</i>

723
00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.440
You mess with them.
and all sorts of craziness

724
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.670
starts to happen.

725
00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.194
Like the night my mom died.

726
00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.034
Changing that
created Flashpoint.

727
00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.794
It looks like Nora
is gonna need a place to stay.

728
00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.556
Uh. yes. and I'll stay
in the lounge.

729
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.239
What lounge?

730
00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.834
This lounge.

731
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.195
Ah.

732
00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.030
- Damn.
- Dad.

733
00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.476
- You found my spot.
- You knew about this?

734
00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.837
I've been napping in here
since day one.

735
00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.277
Uh. well. Nora
was gonna stay here.

736
00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.033
if that's all right with you.

737
00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:33.797
Okay. well. now I can
get to know my granddaughter.

738
00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:37.874
Mm.

739
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.394
I'm sorry. you met Elvis?

740
00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.278
Met him?

741
00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.512
Uncle Wally fought the ghost
of his twin brother.

742
00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.757
I. uh... I went to a monastery.

743
00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.638
and I was trying
to find myself.

744
00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.200
but I was really close.

745
00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.960
Then. the Legends came.
they swooped me up.

746
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.469
and life got even more crazy.

747
00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.711
You want to go back.
don't you?

748
00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.917
I can't.
I mean. I just got here.

749
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.834
I don't want to leave the team.
I don't want to leave you.

750
00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:11.712
Wally. everybody in this room
loves you. especially me.

751
00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:16.750
But you didn't finish
what you set out to do.

752
00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:20.072
<i>and nobody's
gonna get in your way.</i>

753
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.189
So promise me. when you find
what you're looking for.

754
00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.431
come back.
or you're gonna have

755
00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.831
a very angry-looking dad
in your Zen garden.

756
00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.119
Will you take care of him.
XS?

757
00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.873
You got it. Kid Flash.

758
00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.031
Hmm.

759
00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.597
You okay?

760
00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.637
Yeah.

761
00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:47.440
I thought I missed out on
my chance to connect with Nora.

762
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:52.470
but now that she's staying.
I get another shot.

763
00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.472
If you could have seen her
on that plane.

764
00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.438
you'd know that you guys
are already connected.

765
00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.671
Really?

766
00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.720
She was fearless.
just like you.

767
00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.672
- We have a daughter together.
- Yeah.

768
00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:14.037
We make a person.

769
00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:17.716
In the end.
everything works out.

770
00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.871
We get our happy ending.

771
00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.200
Hey.

772
00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.078
If Barry can go back in time.

773
00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.392
why didn't he stop
the Thinker from killing me?

774
00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.709
Kidding. I'm kidding.

775
00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:40.950
Guys. I'm kidding.

776
00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.256
I realize that could have upset

777
00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:44.033
the delicate balance
of the universe.

778
00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.480
Besides. if he did that.
who knows?

779
00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.597
He might have created
a timeline where

780
00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.996
I died in that particle
accelerator explosion.

781
00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.639
Wishful thinking.

782
00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.632
Kidding.
I'm glad you're here.

783
00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.296
and I'm glad that we don't
have to hold your hand

784
00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.896
through the time travel thing;
you're figuring it out.

785
00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.515
Yeah. well. time travel's
not the only mystery I solved.

786
00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:00.656
While you guys
were fighting Gridlock.

787
00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.912
I was. uh. running this down.

788
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.913
- What's this?
- An answer.

789
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.593
And a lot more questions.

790
00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.360
It's my father's
death certificate.

791
00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.511
<i>A friend at county
helped me out with that.</i>

792
00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:22.276
The ME who signed off on it.
Cameron Mahkent?

793
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.158
He doesn't exist.

794
00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:25.959
So then.
this death certificate...

795
00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.191
Is a fake.

796
00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.874
You should get some rest.
You've had a long day.

797
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.440
Ooh. I'll try.

798
00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.597
I'm just so excited.
Like. literally.

799
00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.036
Phasing excited all of
the electron clouds in my body.

800
00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.918
Well. if you're not tired.

801
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.560
two scoops of cookie dough
ice cream sound good right now.

802
00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.676
From Happy Harbor?

803
00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.433
If that's okay with you.

804
00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.272
It is. yeah.

805
00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:55.034
Just. uh. bring me back
some mint chip.

806
00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.672
<i>My name is Nora West-Allen.</i>

807
00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.877
<i>and I'm the
fastest woman alive.</i>

808
00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.872
<i>When I was a child.
my father disappeared</i>

809
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.633
<i>in something impossible.</i>

810
00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.231
<i>Then I grew up
and became the impossible.</i>

811
00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.074
<i>Now I'm trying to live up
to the legacy he created</i>

812
00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:19.392
<i>so that one day. I'll stop him
from ever disappearing.</i>

813
00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.239
<i>I'm XS.</i>

814
00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.596
<i>How schway is that?</i>

815
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.356
<i>CCPD!
Stay where you are.</i>

816
00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:58.954
<i>Freeze. don't move.</i>

817
00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.590
Who the hell are you?

818
00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.634
Wh... what do you want?

819
00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:43.115
For all of you to die.

820
00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.080
<i>Greg. move your head.</i>
