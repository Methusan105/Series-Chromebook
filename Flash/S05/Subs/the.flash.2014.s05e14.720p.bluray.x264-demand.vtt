00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.315
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.999
<i>I can do some cool things.
you know.</i>

3
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.720
Sometimes I run so fast.
I reverse time a bit.

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.871
Dark and Stormy on the house.

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.155
Do I look that pathetic?

6
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.096
You look like you belong here
about as much as I do.

7
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.554
- Cisco.
- Kamilla.

8
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.030
We may have found a way
to suppress the meta genome.

9
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.629
Great. then we can use it
to de-power Cicada.

10
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.256
- stop him for good.
- Who the hell are you?

11
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.509
I'm a reporter.

12
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.960
We're gonna beat you.

13
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.110
Damn. you're good.

14
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.157
real good.

15
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.152
Maybe too good.

16
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.199
We did it.

17
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.554
We did it!

18
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.280
Oh. my.

19
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.239
Cisco Ramon.
tonight you've got yourself

20
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.119
a hot date
and a meta-human cure.

21
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.669
We're unstoppable.

22
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.714
Ooh. shrap...

23
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.113
We have to wait how long

24
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.913
before we can use
the meta-human cure?

25
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.753
Not even that long.

26
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.309
- Cisco.
- It's gonna go by like that.

27
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.880
Cisco.

28
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.157
- 29 days.
- A month?

29
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.599
I know. right?
Just one. teeny. tiny month

30
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.637
until we stop Cicada's purge.
You know.

31
00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.216
historically speaking.
this is way faster

32
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.799
than we've ever
stopped a big bad so...

33
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.236
We can't wait that long.
If he finds another meta

34
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.199
or comes after us... we have
to speed this up somehow.

35
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.776
We have to wait for the
compound to fully synthesize

36
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.560
or it won't be able
to effectively neutralize

37
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.637
the dark matter in
a meta-human's pituitary gland.

38
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.394
Without any way to expedite
the exotic evolution...

39
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.576
Barry.
we're gonna have to wait.

40
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.670
I think we have to wait.

41
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.752
Unless...

42
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.197
you took it into
the Speed Force.

43
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.717
- Hmm?
- What. you want him to go into

44
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.757
the Speed Force for a month
and then. what.

45
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.320
come out the same
day that he left?

46
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.633
Oh. no. no. I'm not saying
you manipulate time.

47
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.916
I'm saying you manipulate
dark matter.

48
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.196
So very simple.
It's simple chemistry. right?

49
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.034
When you are synthesizing
a compound. you use a...

50
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.271
commodity. uh. substrate. uh...

51
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.670
- A catalyst?
- Catalyst. right.

52
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.594
And the most efficient catalyst
you can use when synthesizing

53
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.273
a compound that negates
dark matter

54
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.352
is superluminal particles.

55
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.517
- Tachyons?
<i>- Très bien.</i>

56
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.069
Tachyons. and the place where
tachyons are the most dense?

57
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.914
- The Speed Force.
<i>- Et voilà.</i>

58
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.590
That might actually work.

59
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.876
Yeah. it will.
It'll be like nuking it

60
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.316
in a pan-dimensional microwave.

61
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.959
- Nice work.
- I know.

62
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.719
So how much time
would this save?

63
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.238
From 29 days
down to 60 minutes.

64
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.674
Yeah. it's gonna be faster.

65
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.594
And also since Cicada
has been quiet

66
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.160
since your last encounter.

67
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.311
maybe there's no time
like the present.

68
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.077
- Do it.
- All right.

69
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.389
I'll see you in an hour.

70
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.438
Nora. you need to stay here.

71
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.590
You don't want my help?

72
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.433
I just...
I got this one this time.

73
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.830
Are you sure that now
is a good time to go?

74
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.277
I mean. I just mean.
the city will be Flash-less.

75
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.434
and an hour is a long time
to be without the Flash.

76
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.797
The city is not gonna be
Flash-less. It'll have XS.

77
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.196
Yeah. but what about the time
you had to spend 24 hours

78
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.840
in the Pipeline cell and
Weather Witch and Silver Ghost

79
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.000
- stole that A.R.G.U.S. car...
- And you stopped them

80
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.793
without me.

81
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.032
But with what happened to Mom
because of Cicada...

82
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.512
Nore. Iris is fine. and this
is the key to stopping Cicada.

83
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.511
I gotta go.
If anything happens.

84
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.816
just do what
I've trained you to do:

85
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.559
Slow down and think clearly.

86
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.393
- Yeah.
- I trust you.

87
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.153
You just gotta
trust yourself.

88
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.560
You'll be fine.

89
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.075
60 minutes.

90
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.274
Nora. Cisco hasn't left
for his date yet. has he?

91
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.589
Uh. I don't think so.

92
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.713
Great. we get another
chance at this.

93
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.880
Well. it is... that's why
you don't do it.

94
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.599
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

95
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.795
Oh. God.
Not the <i>Book of Ralph</i> again!

96
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.792
Yeah. buddy.
You successfully completed

97

my 27 steps to getting over
the love of your life.

98
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.715
Gypsy is in the past.
You have a new siren.

99
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.190
so now it's time for...

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.550
Um. Caitlin?

102
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.680
I've gotta finish working on
the device to inject the cure.

103
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.589
Also I have to inject
the device for the cure.

104
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.040
I... I... I... Iris?

105
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.271
Oh. no. this is all you. man.

106
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.560
I got an article
I gotta write.

107
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.114
Let me know when Barry
gets back.

108
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.192
<i>Help me.</i>

109
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.789
"Chapter one:
Initial Planning."

110
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.237
Initial planning?
It's a first date. Sun Tzu.

111
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.040
- not an incursion.
- Trust me. Grasshopper.

112
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.358
love is war. but. fine.
if you wanna skip

113
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.909
to chapter six.
"Know Your Terrain."

114
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.397
- We're meeting at Jitters.
- Ah. familiar territory.

115
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.880
You are learning.

116
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.316
Uh. you know.
he really should be going.

117
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.176
- I really should.
- Hang on. hang on one second.

118
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.238
This one's really important.
Chapter thirteen.

119

"Intelligence
and Reconnaissance."

120
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.636
Wh...
you cyber-stalked Kamilla?

121
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.518
No. no. no. no.
of course not.

122
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.319
That's her public profile.

123
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.800
But it did happen to have
some info

124
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.336
on the types of guys
that she might be into.

125
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.511
The types of guys
that she's into?

126
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.038
Yes. and. unfortunately.
you are nothing like them.

127
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.555
but. hey. if you don't wanna
get a second date. be my guest.

128
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.280
Just don't come crying to me
when everything inevitably

129
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.795
goes horribly. horribly wrong
and you die alone.

130
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.234
No big deal.

131
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.476
See. now he's in my head.
Okay. no thank you.

132
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.074
I didn't take these.

133
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.800
- You saw nothing.
- Nothing.

134
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.280
One Cicada on the bar
for Ian?

135
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.194

137

Hey. Kamilla.

138
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.393
Cisco.
Wow.

139
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.120
Sorry I'm late.
I got held up at a meeting.

140
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.240
That's okay.
I just got here.

141
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.976
If I'd had known.
I would have dressed up more.

142
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.912
Oh. this old thing?

143
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.038
No. please.
this is work clothes.

144
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.874
You have to wear a suit
to your lab?

145
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.076
My lab?

146
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.560
When we met at the bar.

147
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.279
you were talking about
DNA and genomes.

148
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.352
so I assumed you were
some kind of scientist.

149
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.638
Right. I said that.
scientist.

150
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.077
Yes. No. Well.
I'm what you would call

151
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.313
a science businessman.

152
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.111
So. what. you make money
off of other people's discoveries?

153
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.195
Well. somebody has to.

154
00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.669
It's just a little joke.
something I always say.

155
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.394
So. uh. what is the name
of the company you work for?

156
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.629
It's called Ramon Industries.

157
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.637
It's named after yourself?

158
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.035
That's humble.

159
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.677
Maybe I should grab us
a couple coffees.

160
00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.479
Sure.

161
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.270
- Decaf Flash.
- Decaf Flash. right. okay.

162
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.669
You're not the only one
who does their research.

163
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.674
I know who you are.
Iris West-Allen.

164
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:53.398
I know you work with the Flash
and the other heroes.

165
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.075
You said you were
gonna beat me.

166
00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.952
but tonight.
I'm gonna beat you.

167
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.235
all of you.

168
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.991
One Zoom
and one decaf Flash.

169
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.437
That's the decaf.
Men in this city...

170
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.117
Tell me about it.

171
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.511
Uh. I'm sorry. it's work.
I have to go.

172
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.877
Uh. could we just have.
like. a do-over. please?

173
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.634
It's Mom.

174
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.274
Get away from her.

175
00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.113
She's not who you want.

176
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.551
No. she's not.
but you are.

177
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.314
Then come and get us.

178
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.716
Ah!

179
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.433
Caitlin!

180
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.154
Told ya.

181
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.836
Nora. Cisco hasn't left
for his date yet. has he?

182
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.593
Uh. I don't think so.

183
00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.117
Great. we get another chance
at this.

184
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.036
We do.

185
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.193
- What's wrong?
- Uh. nothing.

186
00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.476
I just have to fix this.
Okay.

187
00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.956
Oh. God. not the...

188
00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.156
"Book of Ralph."

189
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.656
- Again!
- Yeah. buddy.

190
00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.592
You have successfully
completed my 27 steps

191
00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.200
to getting over
the love of your life.

192
00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.670
Gypsy is in the past.
you have a new siren.

193
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.956
so now it's time
for <i>The Art of Love.</i>

194
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.679
Um. Caitlin?

195
00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.991
I gotta go finish
the device to inject the cure.

196
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.391
Also have to inject
the device for the cure.

197
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.234
- I... I... I... Iris?
- Oh. no. this is all you. man.

198
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.919
I got an article I gotta write.

199
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.673
Let me know when Barry
gets back.

200
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.240
So not shway.

201
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.915
"Chapter one:
Initial Planning."

202
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.360
- Uh. you can't leave.
- What?

203
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.511
I mean. you just shouldn't go
to your office.

204
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.592
- not right now.
- Why?

205
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.674
Because Dad is gonna be back.
like. any minute

206
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.816
and by the time
that you get there.

207
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.536
you're just gonna
have to turn around anyway.

208
00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.336
Yeah. I know. but I need
to get this article out tonight.

209
00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.560
Yeah. but. I mean. you have
your laptop with you. right?

210
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.154
So why don't you just
write it here

211
00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.074
in the lounge where it's safe?

212
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.594
Safe?

213
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.878
I mean cozy.
It's cozy.

214
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:07.920
Um. yeah. I mean. yeah.
I guess I could.

215
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.071
Great. I'll make you coffee.

216
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.112
- Okay.
- Okay.

217
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.351
You end up dying alone.

218
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:24.633
Okay. see. now he's in my head.
No thank you. Ralph.

219
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.952
Dang it.

220
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.191
Last bottle.

221
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.795
One Cicada at the bar
for Ian.

222
00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.190
- It's I-an.
- Sorry. I-an.

223
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.151
- Kamilla. hey.
- Cisco. wow.

224
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.197
Sorry I'm late.
I just came from the gym.

225
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.999
You gotta get your steps in.
you know?

226
00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.391
That's okay.
I just got here.

227
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.233
You work out a lot?

228
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.597
You kidding me?
I'm. like. a gym rat. you know.

229
00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.831
I live there.

230
00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.400
So what kind of workouts
do you do?

231
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.993
What kind of workouts
don't I do? I mean. like.

232
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:09.596
Pilates for the core.
plyometrics for the quads.

233
00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.416
circuit training. I mean.
pretty much anything

234
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.056
I can get my hands on.
even my hands. you know.

235
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.480
I've been known to do some

236
00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.976
you know. finger pushups
every once in a while.

237
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.835
- What?
- When we met at the bar.

238
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.594
you were talking about
DNA and genomes. so...

239
00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.037
So you thought maybe
I wasn't your type?

240
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.880
I thought I had finally met
a guy who was more concerned

241
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.236
with flexing his brain
than his muscles.

242
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:43.155
Okay. um. maybe I should
grab us a couple coffees.

243
00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.631
Sure. decaf Flash.

244
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.030
Decaf Flash.
I was gonna ask you.

245
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.798
I know who you are.
Elongated Man.

246
00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:05.312
I know you work with the Flash
and the other heroes.

247
00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:13.235
Iris West-Allen told me
you were gonna beat me.

248
00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.960
But tonight.

249
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.431
I'm gonna beat you.

250
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.958
all of you.

251
00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.759
One Zoom and one decaf Flash.

252
00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.638
Thanks.

253
00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.432
- The men in this city.
- Tell me about it.

254
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.398
That's the decaf.

255
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.233
The men in this city...

256
00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.199
Tell me about it.

257
00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.317
Uh. I'm sorry.
it's a gym emergency.

258
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:58.873
I have to go. Um. can we just
have a do-over. please?

259
00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.639
- Ralph.
- Get Caitlin.

260
00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.235
Okay.

261
00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.716
Move!

262
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.437
Ralph?

263
00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.839
Told ya.

264
00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.673
Nora. Cisco hasn't left
for his date yet. has he?

265
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.594
Uh. no. I'm pretty sure
he hasn't.

266
00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.757
Great. I'm gonna get
another chance at this.

267
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.471
Yeah. we do.

268
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.038
What's wrong?

269
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.240
Nora?

270
00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.720
Nothing.

271
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.520
Come on.
you can figure this out.

272
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.956
Not the "Book of Ralph"
again!

273
00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.953
Yeah. buddy. you successfully
completed my 27 steps

274
00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.520
to getting over
the love of your life.

275
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.876
Gypsy is in the past.
You have a new siren.

276
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.759
so now it's time
for <i>The Art of Love.</i>

277
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.910
Um. Caitlin?

278
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.071
I gotta go work on the device
to inject the cure.

279
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.959
Also I have to devise
the cure.

280
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.190
I... I... I... Iris?

281
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.192
Ooh. nah.
that's all you. man.

282
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.475
I gotta go write an article.

283
00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.736
Let me know
when Barry gets back.

284
00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.240
Uh. no. you know what?
Don't go.

285
00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.194
Uh. why don't you write
the article here?

286
00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.437
Uh. I can make you coffee.

287
00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.830
I mean. I know that there's coffee
over there. but I...

288
00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.336
I just think it's really
important for the team leader

289
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.079
to stay here
until Dad gets back

290
00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.231
just in case something
happens. okay?

291
00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.516
Okay. lounge it is.

292
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.672
All right. "Chapter one:
Initial Planning."

293
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.235
It's a first date. Sun Tzu.
not an incursion.

294
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.596
Trust me. Grasshopper.
love is war.

295
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.280
Yeah. and I couldn't agree more.
so read these.

296
00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.056
They'll help you.
and you'll know what to do.

297
00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.256
Wait. wait. how...
And if anything goes wrong.

298
00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.919
just give us a call.

299
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.390
You and I are gonna stay here
and have our own coffees

300
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.477
in the lounge.
There's brownies.

301
00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.630
- Brownies?
- Yes.

302
00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.713
Ralph.
did you cyber-stalk her?

303
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.875
You were talking about
DNA and genomes.

304
00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.496
I thought I'd finally met
a guy who was more concerned

305
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.398
with flexing his brain
than his muscles.

306
00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.159
<i>Ça va?</i>

307
00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.472
Yeah. yeah.
Sorry. I just...

308
00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.553
I'm having the most
wicked déjà vu right now.

309
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.830
Is that right?

310
00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.069
Why don't you want your
mother to come here. hmm?

311
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.675
Because you time-travel.

312
00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.594
- It's I-an.
- Sorry. I-an.

313
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.509
Kamilla the thrilla.

314
00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.751
Cisco?

315
00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.111
- Wow.
- Sorry I'm late.

316
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.793
I just came from a photoshoot.

317
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.759
The things you do
for the 'gram. am I right?

318
00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.116
Hey. maybe next time you should
be my photographer.

319
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.395
What do you think?

320
00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.960
So you're a...

321
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.760
I'm an aspiring
social media influencer.

322
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.479
This is my card.
You can keep that.

323
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.640
When we met at the bar.

324
00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.712
you were talking about
DNA and genomes.

325
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.554
so I assumed you were
some kind of scientist.

326
00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.360
Really?
When we met at the bar.

327
00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.160
you were talking about
DNA and genomes. so I...

328
00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.995
You assumed
I was some kind of scientist?

329
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.232
Yeah. exactly.

330
00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.720
Is everything okay?

331
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:33.154
Yeah. I'm just having
some déjà vu again.

332
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.277
Maybe I should grab us
a couple of coffees?

333
00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.080
Oh. yes.
Yes. that'd be great.

334
00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.800
Will you get me a Zoom.
please?

335
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.678
Okay.

336
00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.672
What?

337
00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.920
Okay. here we go.

338
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.275
Thanks.

339
00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.590
One Zoom and one decaf Flash.
Thank you.

340
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.513
Something's wrong.

341
00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.399
- and I think I have to go.
- Right now?

342
00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.598
No. right now.

343
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:19.477
Yep. gotta go.
Um. I'd ask if we could have

344
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:24.038
a do-over. but. um. something
tells me I already have.

345
00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.390
- The men in this city.
- Tell me about it.

346
00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.277
- Come on!
- It's Sherloque.

347
00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.033
What? I thought he was here
with Caitlin.

348
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.476
- We gotta get Frost.
- No. no. I got this.

349
00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.200
You guys just stay here.

350
00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.230
<i>- Garçon.</i> look out!
- Ah!

351
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.991
Told ya.

352
00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.158
Cisco!

353
00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.233
Why can't I fix this?

354
00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:39.880
Ugh! Why can't
I go back any further?

355
00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.395
- Nora?
- Cisco hasn't left yet.

356
00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.709
Great.

357
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.393
So we get another
chance at this.

358
00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.920
We do.

359
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.390
I'm fine.
Sherloque.

360
00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.312
I have to fix this.

361
00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.630
Okay.
you guys have to stay here.

362
00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.319
- Why?
- Because Dad put his trust

363
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.039
in me that I would protect
all of you

364
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.856
and I'm the only speedster here
for the first time

365
00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.720
and if something were to go
wrong. I don't know

366
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.496
if I could fix it. In fact.
I'm pretty sure that I couldn't

367
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:29.070
fix it. so just.
for one hour. stay here.

368
00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:34.396
I have to go finish...

369
00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.154
- No. no!
- I got a date with...

370
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.835
Were you
cyber-stalking Kamilla?

371
00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.296
No. no. no.
of course not.

372
00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.039
This is her public profile.

373
00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.376
You were talking
about DNA and genomes.

374
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.153
so I thought I'd finally
met a guy

375
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.119
who's more concerned with
his brain than his muscles.

376
00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.157
- Kamilla.
- Oh. I got some details on

377
00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.656
- the kinds of guys she's into.
- Mm-mm.

378
00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.876
Wait.
were you cyber-stalking her?

379
00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.714
No. I'm not stalking her.
It's her public profile.

380
00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.919
Guys! I'm sorry. but you're
just gonna have to stay here.

381
00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.038
- I-an.
- Sorry. I-an.

382
00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.391
You have got to be
kidding me.

383
00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.439
You got the first one.

384
00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.496
- I got the next one.
- I think we all got one.

385
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.056
- Please. please. please...
- What did you get?

386
00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:14.232
- It's Cecile.
- Guys. um. just stay here.

387
00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.713
Told ya.

388
00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.594
Nora?

389
00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.114
I was supposed
to protect you.

390
00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.271
but I can't.
I don't know how to.

391
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.756
But my dad does.

392
00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.553
I can't get into
the Speed Force either?

393
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.713
You're reversing time.
aren't you?

394
00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.598
And I can't fix it.

395
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.199
So all of us die?

396
00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.999
Sometimes.

397
00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.754
or just one of you.

398
00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:55.960
Sometimes Cecile. but every time.
there's at least one.

399
00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.838
I thought I was having
déjà vu.

400
00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.195
Hmm?

401
00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.956
I keep seeing my date
with Kamilla again and again.

402
00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:08.240
me failing miserably every time
by using these.

403
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.630
I'm not having déjà vu.

404
00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.353
I'm vibing the past hour
over and over.

405
00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.635
Yeah.

406
00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.791
How many times
has this happened?

407
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.714
- 52.
- 52?

408
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.080
This is one
of those fixed points

409
00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.152
the Legends theorized.
isn't it?

410
00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.232
There's no way to
keep one of us from dying.

411
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.074
- We have to get Barry.
- No. I tried that.

412
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.296
but there's something
wrong with me.

413
00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.913
I can't get into
the Speed Force.

414
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Well. then we'll just wait
here until he gets back.

415
00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:37.272
No. if we do that.
Cicada will kill Cecile.

416
00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.136
So just reverse time
and go back to before he left.

417
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.358
No. I've tried that too.
but I can't control it.

418
00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:46.832
It doesn't matter what I try
to do. Nothing works!

419
00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:00.670
Believe it or not.
this ain't the first time

420
00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.480
I've died in a past timeline.

421
00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:09.033
I once got a vibrating hand
through the chest

422
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.636
courtesy of Eobard Thawne.

423
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.598
Well. more than once.

424
00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:18.196
I actually kept vibing
that moment until I realized

425
00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.795
that it actually happened.

426
00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.776
I guess I should have known
the same thing

427
00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.075
was happening now. huh?

428
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.553
I keep trying my absolute hardest
to change the outcome.

429
00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.350
but I end up failing
every time.

430
00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.432
What if we can't fix this.
Cisco?

431
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.994
Nora. sometimes
we fail because...

432
00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:50.471
all we worry about
is not failing.

433
00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.231
I'm so worried about
my first date since Cynthia

434
00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.518
that I don't feel free
to be myself around Kamilla.

435
00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.877
and then I'll just end up
screwing it up even more.

436
00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.556
This... this intelligence
and reconnaissance mess.

437
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:10.554
I don't need this.
All I need is to be myself.

438
00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.791
Duh! And I sure as hell

439
00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.032
don't need to dress up
like Ozone

440
00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.197
just to impress Kamilla.

441
00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.556
Sorry. that is
an outdated reference.

442
00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.472
No. from the movie
<i>Breakin'.</i>

443
00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.234
Yeah. I've seen
<i>Electric Boogaloo</i> too.

444
00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.616
I've seen them both.
like. a hundred times.

445
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.869
I know every move.

446
00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.191
Wow. fangirl.

447
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.680
Wait.

448
00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.160
Wait. that's it.

449
00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.154
Every time I fail.
I take notes in my journal

450
00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.936
so I can do something
different the next time.

451
00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.794
We know every move.

452
00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.839
So all you need to do
is just tell us

453
00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.957
everything you've done
and how it went wrong.

454
00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:56.319
So we can figure out
how to make it right.

455
00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.960
52 kidnappings.
52 combinations

456
00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.560
leading to 52 deaths.

457
00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.519
- None of them were Cicada's?
- Exactly.

458
00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.273
Yes. exactly.

459
00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.080
Wait. does that mean you want
to use Cicada's dagger

460
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.629
against him by having Nora
reverse time?

461
00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.234
That's exactly
what I'm suggesting.

462
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.039
Yeah. but how are we
gonna do that?

463
00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.096
I mean. Nora can't control it
when she reverses time.

464
00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.793
She could control
her abilities

465
00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:21.317
if we help her slow down.

466
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.039
Slowing it down.

467
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.840
If she can do that.
we bring the fight to him.

468
00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.799
And we all live
through the night.

469
00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.200
I like the sound of that.

470
00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:33.876
Well. we have
everything we need.

471
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.514
Looking for me?

472
00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.272
I know you did your research.

473
00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:21.798
You know who I am. you know
that I work with the Flash

474
00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.917
and the other heroes.

475
00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.278
I told you
we were gonna beat you.

476
00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.680
and tonight we will...

477
00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:36.599
All of us.

478
00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.000
<i>Allez.</i> now!

479
00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.836
Ah!

480
00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.231
Told you.

481
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:25.393
No dark matter anywhere.
Dwyer's gone. again.

482
00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.278
Maybe after the ass kicking
he just got.

483
00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.317
he'll think twice
before coming after us again.

484
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.234
And if he doesn't think
twice. now you can make him.

485
00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.797
Thanks for helping me
slow it down.

486
00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.355
Now that I've experienced
a sense of control.

487
00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.318
maybe next time.
I can do it on my own.

488
00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.679
Well. thank you for saving us.
all of us.

489
00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.275
I didn't save everything.

490
00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.317
Maybe you can now?

491
00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.676
No. no. that date is over.

492
00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.797
There's no way Kamilla's
still at Jitters.

493
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.634
Well. if she is still there.
there might be some stuff

494
00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.360
in here that can help you
smooth things over.

495
00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.555
But you can handle it.
You're Cisco Ramon.

496
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:08.474
Come on.
you gotta get a move on.

497
00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.472
Okay.

498
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.233
- Giddyap. Romeo.
- I'm moving.

499
00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.039
Okay.

500
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.674
Sherloque was right.
One hour. it's cooked.

501
00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.119
Something happen
while I was gone?

502
00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.030
Kid Flash on the bar
for Steven?

503
00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:36.555
- It's Stephan.
- Sorry. Stephan.

504
00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:44.314
- Kamilla. hey.
- Cisco. wow.

505
00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:51.432
I am so sorry I'm late.
I had an emergency at work.

506
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.039
That's okay.
I just got here.

507
00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.950
So you're a scientist.
right?

508
00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.440
When we were at the bar.

509
00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:05.230
you were talking about
DNA and genomes. so...

510
00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.516
Well...

511
00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:11.833
I'm more of a tech nerd.
actually. but the project

512
00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:15.391
that we're working on now.
it gets very scientific.

513
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.656
You sound like
you're really excited about it.

514
00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.149
Oh. my God. I am.
I'm so excited about it.

515
00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.799
You have no idea. Um...

516
00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:26.671
I think we might have made
a breakthrough recently.

517
00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.150
a breakthrough
that could change a lot of lives.

518
00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.315
One Zoom
and one decaf Flash.

519
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.120
I hope you don't mind.
I called it in ahead of time.

520
00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.873
It's the least I could do.

521
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.998
- That's the decaf.
- How did you know what I like?

522
00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.198
I had a feeling.

523
00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.158
Not like most of the men
in this city.

524
00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.311
Tell me about it.

525
00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:58.073
Listen. I know I screwed up royally
showing up late

526
00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:02.552
like this. but it would make me
very happy if...

527
00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:09.471
Can we just
have a do-over. please?

528
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:11.835
That sounds nice.

529
00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.229
52 times?

530
00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:23.316
53. if you include now.

531
00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.869
That's a lot.

532
00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.637
What was I supposed to do.
let one of them die?

533
00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.633
The thing is. Nora. there are
consequences to time travel.

534
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.632
- Oh. I know.
- No. you don't.

535
00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.880
not like I do.

536
00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.518
Let me show you something.

537
00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:56.240
Imagine this coffee cup
is the space/time continuum.

538
00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:00.997
Whenever you go back in time.
it breaks.

539
00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:08.154
Now. you can try and reset
the timeline.

540
00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:13.076
try and fix it. but no matter
how hard you try.

541
00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.800
it's never
gonna be exactly how it was.

542
00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:21.073
It seems like things worked
out this time.

543
00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.719
but that's not
always gonna be true.

544
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:26.635
and it's impossible to know how
these changes are gonna unfold.

545
00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:30.600
the ripples you'll cause.
whose life you're gonna affect.

546
00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.990
No one can do that.

547
00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.594
No one?

548
00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:35.680
No one.

549
00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.512
We're not gods. Nora.

550
00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.956
We've just been given
extraordinary abilities.

551
00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:31.240
Thawne. I need to know
we're not making this worse.

552
00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.680
Tell me you know
what you're doing.

553
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.594
I am the only speedster
who knows what he's doing!

554
00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.036
Stick with the plan.

555
00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:48.319
Follow my instructions
and we'll defeat Cicada.

556
00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.750
we'll destroy his dagger.

557
00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:55.073
and then we will
save your father.

558
00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.674
<i>Greg. move your head.</i>
