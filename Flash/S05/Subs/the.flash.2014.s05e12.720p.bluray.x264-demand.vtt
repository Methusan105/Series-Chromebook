00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.954
<i>My name is Barry Allen.</i>

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.474
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.199
<i>To the outside world.</i>

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.192
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist.</i>

5
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.313
<i>but secretly. with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs.</i>

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.154
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

7
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.550
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help.</i>

8
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.871
<i>she changed the present.</i>

9
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.475
<i>and now our world is
more dangerous than ever.</i>

10
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.870
<i>and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.277
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

12
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.874
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

13
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.880
I'll deliver it myself.

14
00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:32.917
<i>That is Eobard Thawne.
the Reverse Flash.</i>

15
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.616
- He killed my mother.
- I didn't know that.

16
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.154
My life is a million times
better

17
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.799
and it's all because of you.
Gracie.

18
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.836
<i>She may never wake.</i>

19
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.836
Every meta will die.

20
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.991
This is a DNA sample
from Cicada.

21
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.992
We can make
a meta-human cure.

22
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.400
What if the key to defeating
him is appealing to his heart?

23
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.551
- How do we do that?
- By saving his child.

24
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.632
<i>We need to wake up Grace.</i>

25
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.000
<i>I want you to think about</i>

26
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.878
<i>the biggest secret
in your life.</i>

27
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.913
The one you keep from
the people that you love

28
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.196
or even from yourself.

29
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.112
I want you to imagine
what would happen

30
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.079
if that secret got out.

31
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.629
Remember when you asked
me that?

32
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.832
<i>I've been using all of
your training.</i>

33
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.880
<i>Steadying my pulse.
managing micro-expressions.</i>

34
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.713
<i>limiting non-congruent
gestures.</i>

35
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.952
<i>destroying any piece
of evidence.</i>

36
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.078
<i>I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.</i>

37
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.596
<i>And not just because of
the risks.</i>

38
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.437
<i>But because the closer
I get to my parents.</i>

39
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.589
<i>the more I feel like
I'm hurting them.</i>

40
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.473
Data entry complete. Gideon.

41
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.957
<i>Thank you. Nora West-Allen.</i>

42
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.350
<i>Shall I send this
to the usual recipient?</i>

43
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.480
Yes.

44
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.677
Send it to Eobard Thawne.

45
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.315
priority level urgent.

46
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.349
You ready for this?

47
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.113
Dad. I'm just... I'm not
fast enough yet.

48
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.840
No backing out now. this is
the biggest race of your life.

49
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.674
- Get ready. set. go!
- Not really. Dad. Dad...

50
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.798
Wait. wait!
Oh. God.

51
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.191
Whoa. whoa.

52
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.953
Gotcha.

53
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.838
This is so embarrassing.

54
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.631
I'm really good at the ice
skating game on my Pocket Pal!

55
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.136
Okay. you're just gonna bend
your knees...

56
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.753
- 'Kay.
- And lean forward a little.

57
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.155
Just. yeah.

58
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.515
Yeah.

59
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.616
- I'm doing it.
- You're doing it.

60
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.280
I'm skating.
This is like schway city. Mom.

61
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.794
Thanks.

62
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.551
Look at you guys.

63
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.109
Such a mom.
What? What about you?

64
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.874
You're the one who sprang
for ice skating and game night.

65
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.634
Yeah. well.
I know when Nora got hurt.

66
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.632
I got a little frustrated.

67
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.960
And now. I mean. we have
an actual plan to stop Cicada.

68
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.078
Waking up his niece
to appeal to his heart.

69
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.637
I know Dwyer's a killer.
but he's still a person.

70
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.473
and he loves Grace
just like we love Nora.

71
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.696
So I don't know.
I just feel like

72
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.440
everything's heading
in the right direction.

73
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.557
Here I come. Coming in.
Here we go.

74
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.136
I'm sorry.
why are you wearing a helmet?

75
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.456
I thought you were made
of rubber.

76
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.136
Somebody's gotta set a good
example for these kids.

77
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.231
Hold on. I thought you grew up
on the ice.

78
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.640
Well. I did. basically.

79
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.320
My mom dated a Zamboni
operator. so...

80
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.677
And I tell you where I'm from
we don't date Zamboni drivers.

81
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.479
Why is that?
Because there are no Zambonis.

82
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.398
How do we clear the ice?
All winter long.

83
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.671
we are on our hands and knees
with a squeegee in hand.

84
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.760
Let me tell you.

85
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.832
Best eight months of
the year for this guy.

86
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.320
It's a really great story.
Sherlock.

87
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.400
Sherloque.

88
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.880
You know.
speaking of squeegeeing.

89
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.256
you know who could use
a good squeegeeing

90
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.432
is Larry Blumenthal.
He's dead.

91
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.557
- Larry Blumenthal is dead?
- Yeah.

92
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.632
The patent registrar across
the hall from you

93
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.518
with the 400 square footage...

94
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.954
And the courtyard views?

95
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.076
Yeah. dead as a doornail.

96
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.896
You can have that place
if you want it. Yours to rent.

97
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.559
What? Oh. my God.
This is perfect.

98
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.791
I mean. my ad revenue has been
up this quarter. so...

99
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.576
Yeah. with the extra space
you'd be able to hire

100
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.353
editors. photographers.

101
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.558
I could turn my blog into
a real newspaper.

102
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.637
Oh. my package has arrived.

103
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.313
What package?

104
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.596
This is the solution
to all our problems.

105
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.320
<i>Allez. les amis.</i>
We must go.

106
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.640
<i>Madames et monsieurs.
may I present to you</i>

107
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.791
<i>La Machine à Mémoire.</i>

108
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.599
or as they say in <i>Amérique.</i>
you know...

109
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.416
- The Memory Machine.
<i>- Oui.</i> Iris.

110
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.716
Memory Machine.
Many times...

111
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.156
I have entered into
people's minds

112
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.959
using this very technology.

113
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.878
From the unfortunate
comatose victims

114
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.673
<i>of the Summerholt Institute
to. yes.</i>

115
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.353
Jervis Tetch himself.

116
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.875
the Terrible Mad Hatter Killer
from Earth-221.

117
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.078
I come back from Tannhauser
for one second.

118
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.994
just borrowing a splicer
for the meta cure

119
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.560
and what do I find?

120
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.558
- This. this...
<i>- Machine à Mémoire.</i>

121
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.832
Whatever. How did you even
get this here from Earth-221?

122
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.276
Well. I used the Forerunner
Multiversal Delivery Service.

123
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.416
You don't use it? You don't
have a gold card like me?

124
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.496
<i>- Maybe I'll get you a discount.</i>
- We don't need a discount.

125
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.352
All right.
we just need to wake up Grace.

126
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.715
This'll wake her up. right?

127
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.917
So in most coma patients.

128
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.832
high traffic areas
of brain activity

129
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.357
go dormant and the low traffic
areas spring to life.

130
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.796
but unfortunately.
Grace isn't normal.

131
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.349
Not only has her coma lasted
longer than the average.

132
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.591
but her consciousness
has isolated itself

133
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.751
into one specific region.

134
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.234
her long-term memories.

135
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.312
It will be so facile.
easy peasy for you.

136
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.599
All you do is you transmit
your brainwaves

137
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.473
into Grace's memories. right?

138
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.438
And then you'll lead
her consciousness

139
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.194
out of a neural nexus portal.

140
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.636
And Grace awakens.

141
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.056
It's sort of like when
Barry woke me up

142
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.673
when the Thinker trapped me.

143
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.275
Surprisingly. that sounds
kind of easy peasy.

144
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.960
As long as Grace's
unusual brain damage

145
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.475
doesn't cause any
unforeseen risks.

146
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.199
This is why I suggest
you travel in pairs

147
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.416
when you're using
this technology.

148
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.909
Every time I enter into
someone's memories

149
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.469
when I use this I went
with my partner for sure.

150
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.075
Your partner's name didn't
happen to be Watson. did it?

151
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.636
No. his name was not Watson.

152
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.076
His name was Watsune.

153
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.416
Yes. together we went through
dozens of minds. together...

154
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.160
until one time I found myself

155
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.153
<i>in a memory of a motel room
in Montreal</i>

156
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.519
where what do I find
but Watsune <i>en flagrant délit</i>

157
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.752
in interpersonal relationship
with my wife.

158
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.797
fourth wife. but still.

159
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.111
You're saying you could see
your partner's memories?

160
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.638
It's a possible side effect
of traveling in pairs.

161
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.716
<i>And speaking of which.</i>

162
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.296
which pairs would like
to volunteer for this mission?

163
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.320
I suggest the speedsters

164
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.616
<i>for this to be accomplished
so quick.</i>

165
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.314
- Yeah.
- Elected.

166
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.576
Hey. if you see a memory of me
stealing a blank Scrabble tile.

167
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.096
it's not what it looks like.
all right?

168
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.839
That's a good one. Dad.

169
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.350
All that is left is to
connect this transceiver disc

170
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.160
to Grace's EEG
and we can transmit.

171
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.310
- Great.
- Great.

172
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.616
All right.
first thing tomorrow.

173
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.960
we save Grace.

174
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.674
Any big plans for
the night off?

175
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.274
I'm gonna crash.

176
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.317
Killer Frost was up
all night watching movies

177
00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.835
from her two favorite Johns.
Woo and Hughes.

178
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.196
Huh. I'm more of
a Ford and Waters man myself.

179
00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.114
but I will be up all night
yet again working with

180
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.016
the radiated meta-human
sample you guys got me.

181
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.952
There's something missing with
this cure.

182
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.296
All right.
I'll see you guys later.

183
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.549
- All right.
- Night.

184
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.632
You know. there's something
that I'm missing too.

185
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.996
- Your freshly healed hands.
- Odd choice of words.

186
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.800
Well. I'm meeting with
an informant tonight

187
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.837
and he might have a lead
on Dwyer's location.

188
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.957
but I'm not sure
if I should trust him.

189
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.316
So you need me to vibe him.
Look. man.

190
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.711
I should really be working
on this cure.

191
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.992
But my splicer algorithm

192
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.754
won't technically
be done until 3:00 a.m.

193
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.356
Thanks. man. this is.
this is really important work.

194
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.920
Okay.

195
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.279
Okay. Gideon.
how do I hack this thing

196
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.192
so that Dad won't see
my memories?

197
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.714
<i>In any configuration.</i>

198
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.280
<i>if you and Barry Allen
go in together.</i>

199
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.000
<i>you still risk exposing
your memories.</i>

200
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.396
So I can't do anything.

201
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.350
- Gideon. is that...
<i>- Grace Gibbons' brain waves.</i>

202
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.640
<i>It would appear
Sherloque Wells</i>

203
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.393
<i>has planted
the transceiver disc.</i>

204
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.115
So I can go in alone.

205
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.919
And I'll be back before
anyone notices.

206
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.992
but by that time Grace'll be
awake anyway.

207
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.111
<i>Activating brain wave
transmission.</i>

208
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.870
<i>In three. two. one.</i>

209
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.435
CCPD?

210
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.194
<i>Okay. Jonesy.
who's the kid?</i>

211
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.556
<i>We found her in the car
hiding under the seat.</i>

212
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.711
Her parents were at the ATM
when the meta attacked.

213
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.269
Damn.
We located her next of kin?

214
00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.033
Maybe an uncle.
Still tracking down

215
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.349
his last known address.

216
00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.840
Well. she can't sleep on
this bench.

217
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.190
We've gotta get her
out of here.

218
00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.557
God. poor kid.

219
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.519
- Who are you?
- You can see me?

220
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.593
Oh. right.
you're Grace's consciousness

221
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.115
in her old memory.

222
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.197
I'm Nora.

223
00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.318
Can you take me
to my parents?

224
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.677
No. um. I can't.

225
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.719
but if you come with me.
I can help you feel better.

226
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.437
You know.

227
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.434
when I was your age.
I had a friend just like this.

228
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.274
I bet he'd like
to feel better too.

229
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.237
Yeah.

230
00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.676
Okay.

231
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.958
All right. Gracie.
let's get you through

232
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.872
this portal and out of
your coma

233
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.156
before anyone notices
I snuck in here.

234
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.636
Oh. no.

235
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.280
No. no. no. no. no. no. no.

236
00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.194
Oh. no.

237
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.555
I'm trapped.

238
00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.757
We're gonna find
a way out of here. I promise.

239
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.078
I feel like I've been in this
police station for a long time.

240
00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.595
and now I'm gonna be here
forever. aren't I?

241
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.519
Just leave me alone.

242
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.075
You know.
when I was your age.

243
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.197
I had to come to this
very same police station

244
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.590
all by myself too.

245
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.320
- It's kind of scary in here.
- I'm not scared.

246
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.150
Well. I was.
I'm scared all the time.

247
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.916
In fact. once. there was
this really bad guy

248
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.152
and he wanted to hurt a whole
lot of people on a plane.

249
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.232
A meta?

250
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.232
But I helped stop him.

251
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.994
- Whoa. really?
- I was terrified. though.

252
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.878
But you know what my secret is?

253
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.596
I just imagine what will happen
after I do the thing.

254
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.956
Do you want to try it?

255
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.317
Okay. close your eyes.

256
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.189
and think about what will
happen once you're out of here.

257
00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.749
I'll see Uncle Orlin.

258
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.071
Let's find our way
out of here. okay?

259
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.391
<i>So I can't use "Gazette"?</i>

260
00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.119
"Chronicle"?

261
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.435
So the only name that's cleared
is <i>Central City Citizen.</i>

262
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.716
Uh. yeah. yeah. thanks.

263
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.317
Hey. who was that
on the phone?

264
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.279
Um. a lawyer. she was
helping answer some questions

265
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.750
about me starting a newspaper.

266
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.479
That's cool.
What'd she say?

267
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.709
You know. it doesn't matter.

268
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.071
I-I'm actually not sure
that the timing is right.

269
00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.958
and I really just want to focus
on team Flash

270
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.952
and stopping Cicada.

271
00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.952
Yeah. but...

272
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.793
Oh. hold on.

273
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.234
Hey.

274
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.993
Slow down. slow down.

275
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.878
It's Sherloque.

276
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.599
Nora did what?

277
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.159
Why would Nora go in alone?

278
00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.754
And why isn't she out yet?

279
00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.920
My working theory is that
Grace's unique brain damage

280
00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.633
has caused her brain
to act defensively.

281
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.313
so when it sensed
an outside presence.

282
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.000
it moved all of its
neural nexus pathways

283
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.391
to seal the exits like
a-a quarantine procedure.

284
00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.199
Grace's brain thinks
Nora's a pathogen.

285
00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.318
Yes. we can expect its
synaptic defense mechanisms

286
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.120
to try and eliminate her.

287
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.800
Remember I told you about
the Mad Hatter?

288
00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.435
He was also brain damaged.
so after my dispute with

289
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.115
Watsune and my fourth wife.
Watsune pursued the case

290
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.317
on his own
until the day I found him

291
00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.280
hooked up to the
<i>Machine à Mémoire</i> brain-dead.

292
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.635
You knew this was
a possibility?

293
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.949
What happened to easy peasy?

294
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.636
That's why I say go in
in pairs.

295
00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.473
Barry. we have to go in
after her.

296
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.559
I looked all over CCPD.

297
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.233
There's no sign of the portal.

298
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.896
<i>How could you have looked
everywhere?</i>

299
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.832
You were gone for about
two seconds.

300
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.639
Well. I'm really fast.

301
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.474
<i>I-I used to run track
in high school.</i>

302
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.677
Go CC Squirrels.

303
00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.355
Look. Grace. is there anywhere
else you can take me?

304
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.591
Another memory?

305
00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.319
Where are we?

306
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.959
My house.

307
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.195
Uncle Orlin!

308
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.192
Hey!

309
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.954
Aww. Hey. kiddo.

310
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.151
<i>How you doing?
How was your day?</i>

311
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.840
<i>Let me run through
this again.</i>

312
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:43.070
So Mr. Truck. you said.
You've seen Cicada here?

313
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.755
Dude's been up in here like
a mean fungus.

314
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.356
I see. and how is
the White Russian Hacker?

315
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.397
You wanna focus up here?

316
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.554
So can you tell me.
was he violent?

317
00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.518
Hell yeah. every Thursday.

318
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.877
comes in and assaults
anyone in here.

319
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.914
Unnecessary.

320
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.551
But okay.

321
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.680
<i>♪♪ Running. screaming ♪♪</i>

322
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.471
<i>♪♪ The bad clubs in sin ♪♪</i>

323
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.031
<i>♪♪ Ten feet of terror ♪♪</i>

324
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.158
You're talking about
a band named "Sickada"?

325
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.356
Yeah. bro.

326
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.591
You said "that dude"
assaulted people.

327
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.832
He assaults everyone in here
with that terrible music.

328
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.920
Dibs.

329
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.696
Well. that didn't pan out
the way that I hoped.

330
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.313
We will have two
Mother-In-Laws. please.

331
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.596
No. no. no. no. Truck.
thank you for your time.

332
00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.353
- I think we're done here.
- One drink.

333
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.000
I'm paying.

334
00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.878
One drink.
but only because

335
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.270
you never pay for anything ever
and I'm really curious

336
00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.034
to see what hell looks like
frozen over.

337
00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.632
We can't warn her
we're coming?

338
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.076
We wanted to install
an emergency beacon.

339
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.160
but it didn't work.

340
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.436
So once you enter.
it'll create a new portal.

341
00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.274
You'll only have a few moments
to find Grace and Nora

342
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.159
before Grace's brain tries
to seal it off.

343
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.960
Remember.
if you die in there...

344
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.751
We die out here.
I remember from DeVoe.

345
00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.912
We're gonna save her.
I promise.

346
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.879
<i>Commencing
brainwave transmission.</i>

347
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.597
Good luck.

348
00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.038
CCPD.

349
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.711
All right. come on.

350
00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.480
<i>We found her hiding in
the last car under the seat.</i>

351
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.358
- And her parents?
- No idea.

352
00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.193
She was on the Red Line
headed downtown.

353
00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.431
Must've jumped the turnstile
at Fourth and Waid.

354
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.951
We can't just let her sleep
on this bench.

355
00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.157
Oh. my God. Barry.

356
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.435
Wait. is that...?

357
00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.239
Is that Joe West's
granddaughter?

358
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.511
<i>Nora? Hey. Nora.</i>

359
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.512
<i>Someone get her.</i>

360
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.872
I don't think we're
in Grace's memories.

361
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.189
We're in Nora's.

362
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.155
There's been no changes
in Grace's brain activity.

363
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.560
But look.

364
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.472
<i>Nora's brain activity
has tripled.</i>

365
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.960
That means...

366
00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.317
Barry and Iris are
in Nora's memories.

367
00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.154
How did we end up in Nora's
childhood memories?

368
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.038
I have no idea.
I also have no clue

369
00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.591
how we're gonna rescue Nora
from here.

370
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.560
Okay. Okay. we're in a memory
within a memory. right?

371
00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.640
Yeah.

372
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.359
So if we went through
a portal. then...

373
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.477
It should take us into Grace.

374
00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.160
Okay. yeah. we just have to
wander through Nora's memories

375
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.118
until we find where
the portal went.

376
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.874
Okay.

377
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.917
Maybe she'll lead us
right there.

378
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.236
Whoa.

379
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.754
What happened here?

380
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.759
I guess in Nora's future.
S.T.A.R. Labs is...

381
00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.150
- The Flash Museum.
- The Flash Museum.

382
00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.200
No way.

383
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.999
Look at this.

384
00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.074
Flash toys and Flash phones.

385
00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.837
Flash rings.
Are you kidding? Wow.

386
00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.718
This is all gonna go
to your head. isn't it?

387
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.395
Oh. you know what?
It looks like it might.

388
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.199
Oh. that is very cute.

389
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.358
Hey. I found her.

390
00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.676
You think we can talk to her?

391
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.991
No. I wish.

392
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.596
This might be the only time
I get to see her at this age.

393
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.976
Nora's consciousness
isn't here. though.

394
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.639
It's in Grace.
This is a fixed memory.

395
00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.479
We can't interfere.

396
00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.314
When I was ten. I wasn't
running away from home.

397
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.176
That's 'cause you were
a good kid.

398
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.600
I ran away all the time.

399
00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.559
Yeah. only 'cause you were
trying to see your dad.

400
00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.791
Not 'cause you were running
from someone.

401
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.230
Oh. hey. we should keep trying
to find the portal.

402
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.116
Come on. Gracie. no cussing.

403
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.237
Please. can we. please?

404
00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.277
Okay. fine.

405
00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.671
A rare. old bird is a pelican
whose beak can hold more

406
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.120
than his belly can.

407
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.398
He can hold in his beak
enough food for a week.

408
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.200
But I'm darned if I know
how the hell he can.

409
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.800
Grace. I was thinking maybe
we could go now

410
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.917
and look for the portal?

411
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.555
Is something burning?

412
00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.994
Oh. crap.

413
00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.754
I mean. crud.

414
00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.877
He thinks he takes
care of me now.

415
00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.792
but I really take care of him.

416
00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.355
<i>Okay. kiddo.
you better eat up.</i>

417
00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.477
<i>We've got a big day.</i>

418
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.880
This is...

419
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.356
<i>First we're going
to the zoo...</i>

420
00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.432
<i>This is an interesting
doll house.</i>

421
00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.352
<i>We're gonna get
ice cream. and then...</i>

422
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.272
Can't forget the fair.

423
00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.317
Fair?

424
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.232
Where you got hurt.

425
00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.516
Grace. I-I think that's where
the portal is.

426
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.790
Can you take me there?

427
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.792
To the last place
that you remember?

428
00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.799
Okay.

429
00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.072
Hey. check her out.

430
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.629
She's right up your alley.
You should buy her a drink.

431
00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.280
Damn.
Look at that hand stitching.

432
00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:44.798
No. no. I did not come here
to admire jackets.

433
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.554
I came here to vibe
an informant.

434
00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.154
Is it just me
or are there a lot

435
00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.800
of ladies in leather in here?

436
00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.076
Yep. singles night.

437
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.914
It's quite a coincidence.

438
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.514
Is it?

439
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.796
What is it
you're always saying?

440
00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.271
- "I smell a mystery"?
- That is trademarked.

441
00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.955
I can vibe the anxiety coming
off of you right now.

442
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.157
This whole thing was a setup.

443
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.711
Of course your informant
didn't know Cicada.

444
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.439
I mean. he knew of Cicada.

445
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.399
You lied to me.
you wasted my time

446
00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.517
so I could be your wingman
tonight?

447
00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.114
No. no. no. dude.
it's not like that.

448
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.550
You know. just when I think
you're growing up.

449
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.393
you go ahead and do something
that shows me

450
00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.278
you're just as selfish
as the day we met.

451
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.272
That's for the drinks.

452
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.397
Excuse me.

453
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.560
<i>Wait.</i>

454
00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.395
These guys get their own wing?

455
00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.120
<i>Who is Cicada?
Officials believe...</i>

456
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.096
Barry. maybe we should keep
looking for the portal.

457
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.520
Yeah.

458
00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.280
<i>But when Cicada resurfaced
in 2024</i>

459
00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.955
<i>after the Flash vanished.
some were left to speculate</i>

460
00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.396
<i>that Cicada is not a man
at all.</i>

461
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.557
<i>but an immortal monster.</i>

462
00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.439
<i>All we know for sure
is his body count.</i>

463
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.354
<i>152 victims and rising.</i>

464
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.750
Wait. what?

465
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.356
I knew we never caught Cicada.
but he never stops killing?

466
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.080
<i>Flash did everything
he could.</i>

467
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.720
<i>but Cicada killed more people
than Zoom</i>

468
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.031
<i>or even the Red Death.</i>

469
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.399
<i>And the way the city saw
the Flash. his legacy...</i>

470
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.232
<i>it was never the same.</i>

471
00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.634
Nora West-Allen. you are in
serious trouble. young lady.

472
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.160
Grace. what are we
doing here?

473
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.038
You wanted to go
to my last memory.

474
00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.715
Yeah. but I thought that was
supposed to be at the fair.

475
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.517
Grace?

476
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.478
Hello?

477
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.234
<i>The destructive phenomenon
emanated from a satellite</i>

478
00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.313
<i>that had fallen into
a decaying orbit.</i>

479
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.800
<i>Thankfully.
before the satellite</i>

480
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.315
<i>could strike the city...</i>

481
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.993
How does she remember this?

482
00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.594
<i>A catastrophic event...</i>

483
00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.320
<i>A new meta was last seen
jumping off a building</i>

484
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.119
<i>in order to evade capture
after...</i>

485
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.792
<i>I'm gonna
make this right. Gracie.</i>

486
00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:12.079
Every meta will die.

487
00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.635
Grace. how did you hear Orlin
that night?

488
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.235
- You were in a coma.
- I know.

489
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.158
But I've been listening.

490
00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.800
<i>- You have to stop.
- Not until I'm finished.</i>

491
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.234
Did they come after
you tonight?

492
00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.199
I killed his partner. Vibe.

493
00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.158
<i>but there was
a woman there too.</i>

494
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.152
banged me up pretty bad.

495
00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.959
<i>She had speed.</i>

496
00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.474
I think she's
the Flash's daughter.

497
00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.836
Grace. I don't know
what you think Orlin said...

498
00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.832
You said you looked
everywhere.

499
00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.435
I get it now.
You have speed.

500
00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.398
<i>You're her. aren't you?</i>

501
00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.358
You're the Flash's daughter.

502
00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.716
You're the one
who hurt my uncle.

503
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.593
Grace. I want to help you.

504
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.719
No. you don't.
Uncle Orlin told me about you.

505
00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.837
You and your dad
are trying to hurt him.

506
00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.230
Only because he's trying
to hurt other people.

507
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.595
innocent people!

508
00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.794
No. he only hurts metas.

509
00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.991
like the one who killed
my parents.

510
00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:27.278
Like you!
You're a meta and a liar!

511
00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.680
All metas aren't bad.

512
00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.958
My uncle is a hero.
He protects people.

513
00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.475
and I protect my uncle!

514
00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.194
My speed's gone.

515
00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.336
<i>Did you think that
you could run away</i>

516
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.816
<i>and I wouldn't figure out
where you went?</i>

517
00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.136
It's my job to find out
the truth.

518
00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.958
- I'm a reporter.
- You're always a reporter.

519
00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.833
Why not be my mom for once?

520
00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.877
Oh. yeah?
How's this for being your mom?

521
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.376
You are never coming back
to this place again.

522
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.039
Let's go.

523
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.077
Excuse me.
what is in your pocket?

524
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.992
- Hand that over right now.
- It's not yours.

525
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.800
Well. it is now. There are
consequences to your actions.

526
00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.712
Hand it over.

527
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.480
I hate you.

528
00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.630
Leave it.
Let's go.

529
00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.839
Iris. that wasn't you.

530
00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.598
Yeah. but it will be. Barry.

531
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.776
Nora's gonna grow up
hating her mother.

532
00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.917
No. she won't. You're gonna
make different choices.

533
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.037
If you don't wanna be that
person that we just saw.

534
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.440
- don't be that person.
- I know.

535
00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.776
I know you keep saying that.
Barry.

536
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.439
and that's what I'm trying
to do.

537
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.318
I had a moment today
and I thought that

538
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.357
maybe if I could change
the timeline now.

539
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.874
that even in the smallest way

540
00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.553
that... I don't know.

541
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.712
That everything in the future
would be somehow different.

542
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.918
This is why you changed
your mind about the newspaper.

543
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.719
When I talked to the lawyer.

544
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.111
I asked her to check
a dozen potential names.

545
00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.476
and guess which one
was the only one that cleared.

546
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.631
The "Central City Citizen."

547
00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.632
I know it's got baggage.
but it's just a name.

548
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.110
Is it? I mean. we've been
looking at that front page

549
00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.594
for four years.

550
00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.071
"Flash Missing.
Vanishes in Crisis."

551
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.238
And I'm the one that writes
that article. Barry.

552
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.754
I just thought that.
I don't know.

553
00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.016
maybe if I don't start
the paper. that...

554
00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.872
Iris. this is your dream.

555
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.559
and the city needs
somebody like you.

556
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.279
Yeah. but. Barry.
look where it gets us.

557
00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.319
These are Nora's memories
right now in this timeline

558
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.392
after she interfered.

559
00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.354
Let's keep looking
for the portal. okay?

560
00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.477
Nora needs our help.

561
00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.079
I'll have whatever
he's having.

562
00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.431
All I want to order right now
is a Lyft out of here.

563
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.115
but I get no bars in this bar.

564
00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.296
so maybe I'll just have to
leave the old-fashioned way

565
00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.549
and breach on out of here.

566
00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.155
Look. Cisco. I'm...

567
00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.919
Sorry I lied to you.

568
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.354
Don't apologize to me.

569
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.080
Apologize to all
the meta-humans out there

570
00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.839
still waiting for a cure.

571
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.674
for their right to choose if
they want these powers or not.

572
00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.710
Before I was
The Elongated Man.

573
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.191
when I was just nobody
Ralph Dibny.

574
00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.840
I could do whatever I wanted
whenever I wanted.

575
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.118
but I didn't have any friends
to do those things with.

576
00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.872
So I just thought if. uh.
we're getting a night off

577
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.077
from stopping Cicada.
we could just

578
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.635
go out and...

579
00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.279
have some fun. you know?

580
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.477
And I want that too.

581
00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.110
but after we figure out
this cure.

582
00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.679
You know.
my mom's friend Doug.

583
00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.479
he had a saying.

584
00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.313
"If you're always waiting
to live your life.

585
00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.914
you're gonna die
before it starts."

586
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.597
And Doug. he would know.
He operated a Zamboni.

587
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.353
May he rest in peace.

588
00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.079
All right.
I'ma go outside.

589
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.536
see if I can stretch
my arm high enough

590
00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.314
to get you some
cell phone service.

591
00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.031
Dark and Stormy
on the house.

592
00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.554
Do I look that pathetic?

593
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.996
You look like you belong here
about as much as I do.

594
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.237
Thought I was coming here
for a business meeting.

595
00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.391
What do you do.
sell leather?

596
00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.597
- Nope.
- Tattoo artist.

597
00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.319
- Mm-mm.
- Gun for hire.

598
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.632
Trust me.

599
00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.518
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

600
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.920
Well.
I'm a photographer.

601
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.276
so it looks like we're both
a little lost.

602
00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.760
So what's your excuse?

603
00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.275
Taking pictures hasn't made
me rich. yet.

604
00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.113
so I bartend to pay rent.

605
00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.600
My sister hooked me up here.

606
00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.751
Forgot to mention
I'd be working in hell.

607
00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.677
Sisters.

608
00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.832
If I looked at the DNA
of two siblings.

609
00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.276
one who became a meta
and one who didn't.

610
00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.352
I would have a close enough
genetic match

611
00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.794
to isolate the part
of the genome

612
00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.678
that controls meta-genes.

613
00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.436
I'm sorry.
did I just say that out loud?

614
00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.477
Yeah. you did.

615
00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:15.315
I-I just... that... I...

616
00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.357
- Cisco.
- Kamilla.

617
00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.274
<i>- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.</i>

618
00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.874
I can't find the portal
anywhere.

619
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.795
I can't even get out of Nora's
memories of this one day.

620
00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.280
Barry. get down!

621
00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.716
Nora's in trouble.
Grace's defense mechanisms

622
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.075
must be attacking her.

623
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.919
She's not the only one
who's in trouble.

624
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.536
<i>We need to get them
out of there now.</i>

625
00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.272
It's Nora's
defense mechanism.

626
00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.951
What am I supposed to do now?

627
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.475
Hello?

628
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.552
- Nora. is that you?
<i>- Caitlyn!</i>

629
00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.154
Yes. I told you
the M.A.D. 2.0

630
00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.078
could complete
your emergency beacon.

631
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.040
Uh. Nora. your parents
went into your memories.

632
00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.309
<i>Uh. let me conference them in.</i>

633
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.995
Sorry. my parents went where?

634
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.992
- Iris West-Allan.
- Mom? Dad?

635
00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.958
- Nora. are you okay?
<i>- So listen.</i>

636
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.896
- We made an important discovery.
<i>- To get you out of there.</i>

637
00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.992
The portals are hidden
in perception gaps.

638
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.470
Things that you remember
the way you want them to be.

639
00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.914
not the way they actually were.

640
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.256
<i>'Cause you're in denial
or your perception</i>

641
00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.317
<i>was colored by anger
or what have you.</i>

642
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.681
So these defense mechanisms.
they're composed of synapses.

643
00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.360
If you can break down the
synapses in the false memory.

644
00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.159
<i>that will reveal
the real memory</i>

645
00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.835
and the synaptic jolt
will expose the portal.

646
00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.560
Okay. so... okay. well.
how do we do that?

647
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.155
Well. uh.
we'll have to call you back.

648
00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.310
You're burning up.

649
00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.917
Hello?

650
00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.437
Perception gaps.

651
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.394
The dollhouse.

652
00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.714
How do we know which memories
weren't real?

653
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.791
Of course... Iris.
it's the Hall of Villains.

654
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.880
You and Nora.

655
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.270
Barry. I still dampen
Nora's power.

656
00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.033
She still grows up hating me.

657
00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.589
- This is my future.
- No. no. it's not.

658
00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.831
It's just a memory.
one warped from the perspective

659
00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.116
of a sad. angry. little kid
that ran away from home.

660
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.510
Don't you get it? That person
that we saw in there.

661
00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.796
the bad mom
that Nora told us about.

662
00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.918
she doesn't even exist
in any timeline.

663
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.276
<i>I told you you had to be
different in the future.</i>

664
00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.360
but I was wrong.

665
00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.999
You don't have to change
who you are.

666
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.232
You don't even have to change
the name of your newspaper.

667
00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:15.234
I know any future with you
in it is gonna be a good one.

668
00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.677
You just gotta believe
that too.

669
00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.558
What are you doing here?

670
00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.791
Please.
this memory isn't real.

671
00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.317
Your uncle's house. I don't
think it's really like this.

672
00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.119
Okay. better eat up. kiddo.

673
00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.240
We got a big day...

674
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.390
Grace. get down!

675
00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.038
I don't see
the portal anywhere.

676
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.439
Barry. it's working!

677
00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.557
Death. Failure.

678
00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.951
Another broken family.

679
00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:20.432
<i>This is the legacy I gave you.</i>

680
00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.716
Nobody breaks up my family.
you son of a bitch.

681
00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.236
Oh. no.

682
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.957
You dropped your toy.

683
00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.157
I just wanted to see
the museum.

684
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.480
I know. honey.
but you ran away.

685
00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.914
I didn't know where you went.

686
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.560
I was afraid you could have
gotten hurt.

687
00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.876
You said that the museum
reminded you of Dad

688
00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.634
<i>'cause Dad was the Flash's
number one fan.</i>

689
00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.189
So I wanted to see it

690
00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:28.320
'cause I love the Flash too.

691
00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.477
It's not fair.

692
00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.871
I know. honey.
I know it's not fair.

693
00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.031
I love you. Nora.

694
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:38.191
<i>Your dad loved you too.</i>

695
00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.511
<i>So. so much.</i>

696
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.914
Come here. girl.

697
00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.237
<i>Come on. We gotta go.</i>

698
00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.512
<i>Let's go get Nora.</i>

699
00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:03.077
Grace. I know you're afraid.

700
00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.160
You think that you'll never
be as happy as you were

701
00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.395
that day with your uncle.

702
00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:09.672
That's why you try to remember
it as perfect.

703
00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:13.151
but things can be
that good. Grace.

704
00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:17.029
You just have to wake up.

705
00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.998
And then you and me
and my parents.

706
00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.680
we can all help
your uncle together.

707
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.711
You're a liar.

708
00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.317
Grace.

709
00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.835
Maybe you don't have anyone
who cares about you.

710
00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.674
<i>but I have someone
who cares about me.</i>

711
00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.390
and I'm the only one
who can help him.

712
00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.994
Mom.

713
00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.151
- Hey.
- She's not coming.

714
00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.913
- What?
- Hurry!

715
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.070
Come on. Come on.

716
00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.116
They're okay.

717
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.120
Neural oscillations
are normal.

718
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.440
You three are
perfectly healthy.

719
00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.776
Oh. and we think
we've figured out

720
00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.393
how you two ended up
in Nora's brain.

721
00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.790
<i>That is a satellite shard</i>

722
00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:42.270
full of dark matter
in Grace's head.

723
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.396
<i>Mon dieu.</i>

724
00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.597
<i>Sometimes surgeons
leave a piece of shrapnel</i>

725
00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.559
in a patient's brain if
it's too dangerous to remove.

726
00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.416
<i>and we think that the dark
matter was seeping out</i>

727
00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.591
to create a barrier around
her brain.

728
00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.036
We can't go back in
as long as it's there.

729
00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.120
It's too dangerous.

730
00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.590
Well. we need to find another
way to stop Cicada.

731
00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.752
I think I might be able
to help with that.

732
00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.119
It's the inside
of Dwyer's house.

733
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.475
<i>Whoa.</i>

734
00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:12.656
- Damn.
<i>- I mean. that's great.</i>

735
00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.399
But why did you go in
without us?

736
00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.630
<i>We had a plan.</i>

737
00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.155
No. I know. um...

738
00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.391
You know. just with the machine
being ready

739
00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.358
and knowing that Cicada
was still out there

740
00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.877
I guess I just. um.
I got a little excessive.

741
00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:29.192
It's not the only reason.
though. right?

742
00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.239
It was protecting her secret.

743
00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.516
What secret is that?

744
00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.600
Well. her feelings for her
mother when she was a child.

745
00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.478
Must be painful memories.

746
00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.720
Is that correct. Nora?

747
00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.314
Yeah. exactly.

748
00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:00.592
Okay. um. let's get started
on this lead.

749
00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:01.909
Good job. Nora.

750
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.434
Thanks.

751
00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:11.429
Monsieur Allen. just for my
records for today's events.

752
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:16.834
what was the defense mechanism
Nora was using?

753
00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.953
It was one of the costumes
from the museum.

754
00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.191
What costume?

755
00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.272
The Reverse Flash.

756
00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.836
<i>Surprise!</i>

757
00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.991
Happy first day
in your new office.

758
00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.355
You're so sweet.

759
00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.396
So have you decided what
you're gonna name the paper?

760
00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.119
I don't know.

761
00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.795
"Central City Citizen"
has a certain ring to it.

762
00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.191
- You sure?
- Yeah. you were right.

763
00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.158
Future isn't always
what it seems.

764
00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.993
<i>We decide what it gets to be.</i>

765
00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.914
So. um. I just have to
tell you one little thing.

766
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.280
See that ledger down there?

767
00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.353
That's the year the paper
was founded in my time.

768
00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.874
2021.

769
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.595
That's two years from now.

770
00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.957
You're changing
the future already.

771
00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.880
Hey. um. I gotta find Cisco.

772
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.838
but I'll see you guys later.
all right?

773
00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.274
Okay.

774
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.993
Let's head back.

775
00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.078
- Mom?
- Yeah?

776
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:40.234
Dad told me about the memory
that you saw.

777
00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.631
I know it wasn't real. Nora.

778
00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:46.519
but it must have come
from a very real place.

779
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:50.150
You must have been so angry
with me to see me that way.

780
00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.153
I was angry all the time.

781
00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.755
Angry for not getting
to have a dad.

782
00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:00.915
angry 'cause nobody seemed to
understand what I was feeling.

783
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.913
And it didn't matter
what you did or said. Mom.

784
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.959
I was always gonna be angry
at you...

785
00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.680
because you were there.

786
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.752
You were going through
a lot. Nora.

787
00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.071
But so were you.

788
00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.336
I mean. I thought
you were trying

789
00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:16.874
to stop me from being me.

790
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.475
but you were trying to stop me
from being Dad.

791
00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.997
I mean. ending up like him.

792
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:26.198
You guys had a whole
life together

793
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.751
and a child.
and he vanished.

794
00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:35.120
I-I can't imagine how hard
that must have been for you.

795
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.840
And from that day. you...

796
00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.559
you were protecting me.

797
00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.394
I-I get that now.

798
00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.594
So sorry for the way
that I treated you.

799
00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:51.630
both back then and now
when I first got here.

800
00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.200
You didn't deserve that.

801
00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.874
Thank you.

802
00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:05.560
You're an amazing woman.
Nora West-Allen.

803
00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.235
I will always love you.

804
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.039
past. present. and future.

805
00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.589
I love you too. Mom.

806
00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.280
<i>It's hard to keep
a secret. but it's a lot easier</i>

807
00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.816
<i>when you're reminded
why you're doing it.</i>

808
00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:17.840
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

809
00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:18.920
- Okay.
- Okay.

810
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.720
<i>I met someone who told me
that she would do anything</i>

811
00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.598
<i>to protect her family.</i>

812
00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:29.800
She helped me see
that... so would I.

813
00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.474
My parents can't know that
you're helping me stop Cicada.

814
00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.836
There's too much at risk.

815
00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:40.357
And I'll do anything
to protect them.

816
00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.516
Even lie.

817
00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.113
<i>Liar.</i>

818
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.634
<i>Liar.</i>

819
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:55.071
<i>Liar. Liar.</i>

820
00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.595
Nora lied to me.

821
00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:00.716
She'll pay.

822
00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.438
They'll all pay.

823
00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.839
Doug was right.

824
00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.230
Going out there.
doing the ice skating thing.

825
00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.312
that was definitely
the right thing to do.

826
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:19.279
Yeah. all Doug.
may he rest in peace.

827
00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.431
Let's pour one out
for the guy.

828
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.159
Kamilla?
The bartender?

829
00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:26.153
- Uh. excuse me.
- Dude. nice.

830
00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.799
- All right. all right.
- Yeah.

831
00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.718
Hey. did you guys
make a breakthrough

832
00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:30.990
with the meta-human cure?

833
00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.515
We did.
I managed to locate

834
00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.592
a pair
of meta-non-meta siblings.

835
00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.918
so this cure.
it's as good as done.

836
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.754
All right. good.
because I've been thinking.

837
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.872
I want to use the cure
on Cicada.

838
00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.074
<i>Greg. move your head.</i>
