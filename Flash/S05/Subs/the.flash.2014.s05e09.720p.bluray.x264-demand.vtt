00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.875
<i>My name is Barry Allen.</i>

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.952
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.190
<i>To the outside world.</i>

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.192
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist.</i>

5
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.357
<i>But secretly.
with the help of my friends</i>

6
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.352
<i>at S.T.A.R. Labs.
I fight crime</i>

7
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.159
<i>and find other
meta-humans like me.</i>

8
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.550
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help.</i>

9
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.871
<i>she changed the present.</i>

10
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.475
<i>And now our world
is more dangerous than ever.</i>

11
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.870
<i>and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.435
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

13
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.760
You failed.

14
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.752
Why are you doing this?

15
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.071
You did this to yourself.

16
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.074
And now all of you will perish.

17
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.275
My name is Dr. John Deegan.
and I. like most of you.

18
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.431
I'm a psychiatrist.

19
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.791
Do you know what my patients
tell me the most?

20
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.520
They feel inferior.

21
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.798
I'm here to tell you.
whether we admit it or not.

22
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.159
some people.
they're just born lucky.

23
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.671
which leads us to
the real problem. imperfection.

24
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.639
How can we ever hope
to feel like

25
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.430
supermen or superwomen

26
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.275
without first becoming
super ourselves?

27
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.431
I'm here to tell
you how. folks.

28
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.639
If we utilize eugenic insights.
I feel...

29
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.674
Hey. Frankenstein. go back
to your mad scientist lab.

30
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.673
Ma'am. ma'am. please...
would you wait. please?

31
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.991
Folks. folks. folks.
please listen.

32
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.278
I'm just saying. we can truly
help our patients.

33
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.920
Listen to me!

34
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.360
Idiots!

35
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.032
<i>Doctor.</i>

36
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.352
<i>Dr. John Deegan.</i>

37
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.719
I need your help. John.

38
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.759
Go find someone else
to prank. douchebag.

39
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.800
My God. what are you?

40
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.190
Something beyond
your comprehension.

41
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.875
I've traveled far
to this place and time

42
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.317
to lay this precious burden
at your feet.

43
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.474
Use this book to reshape
the world as you see fit.

44
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.237
Show them what a real god
can do. John.

45
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.794
Why me?

46
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.678
You have vision.

47
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.958
That book holds the key
to your transformation. John.

48
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.517
and all you have to do
is open it.

49
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.917
<i>Use it wisely. John.</i>

50
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.834
The universe is in your hands.

51
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.515
I can... I can see...

52
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.711
I can see everything.

53
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.157
And a word of advice:

54
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.436
think big.

55
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.750
<i>Honey. breakfast is ready.</i>

56
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.557
<i>Honey.</i>

57
00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.875
<i>It'll get cold.</i>

58
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.679
What?

59
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.040
Morning.

60
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.589
Look. babe. they're perfect
this time.

61
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.310
What if Barry walks in?

62
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.392
What if he could have
seen that?

63
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.596
See...

64
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.512
Where's Barry?

65
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.751
Did you get enough sleep
last night?

66
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.911
Look. babe. I know that
we haven't caught Cicada.

67
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.957
but Caitlin's immunity
can help us.

68
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.040
Who's Cicada?

69
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.874
Our big bad.

70
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.872
Barry. are you okay?

71
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.314
I'm Barry?

72
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.958
What is wrong?

73
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.676
Honey. hi.
Talk to me.

74
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.514
I did not get enough sleep.

75
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.035
Are you... you sure
it's not my cooking?

76
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.120
'Cause...

77
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.840
No. no.

78
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.669
These smell delicious.

79
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.114
Thank you.

80
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.236
You know what?

81
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.391
I think that you call
Captain Singh

82
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.199
and you ask for a day off.

83
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.680
Look. with all
the superhero-ing

84
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.071
you've been doing. I think
you've earned it. honey.

85
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.231
You think maybe I should
go into S.T.A.R. Labs?

86
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.960
What... what?

87
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.120
Only my husband would think

88
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.640
working on Speed Force
equations

89
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.876
would be called a day off.

90
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.830
I love you. Barry Allen.

91
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.636
I love you. Iris West-Allen.

92
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.997
Break in at Ivo Labs.

93
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.799
Cisco's on comms.

94
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.678
I'll meet you guys
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

95
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.312
Whoa... whoa.

96
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.030
Whew.
That's a rush.

97
00:06:06.521 --> 00:06:08.034
Sorry. I polished it
last night

98
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.191
and left it on our dresser.

99
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.710
Oh. Barry.
what have you done this time?

100
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.270
<i>Barry. we got
a break-in at Ivo Labs.</i>

101
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.158
<i>two armed men
going after diamonds.</i>

102
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.311
<i>the ones they use
for conductors.</i>

103
00:06:45.401 --> 00:06:46.436
Hey. pump the brakes.

104
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.800
<i>You're gonna have
to hang a U-ey.</i>

105
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.753
'cause you passed Ivo
by about 18 blocks.

106
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.840
Found it.

107
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.480
<i>Someone's excited
to get to work.</i>

108
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.752
It is too early for this.

109
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.316
Forget it. Flash.

110
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.194
We're leaving with
the diamonds. or this guy dies.

111
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.033
I said back off.

112
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.736
<i>Hey. what are you
doing there?</i>

113
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.513
Just hit the guy
with the lightning punch.

114
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.759
You have failed this city.

115
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.832
Pretty sure that's
not your line.

116
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.120
Your adrenaline levels
are off the charts.

117
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.310
<i>What's going on?</i>

118
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.750
Overkill much?

119
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.990
<i>Cops are on the way.</i>

120
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.555
<i>Why don't you just let them
take over from here?</i>

121
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.519
So he's fine. Caitlin?

122
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.750
Mm-hmm.

123
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.990
Oh. God. thank goodness.

124
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.037
Really?
There are no anomalies?

125
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.600
I don't... I don't have
a brain tumor?

126
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.680
Nothing?

127
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.353
Barry. you're
in perfect shape.

128
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.836
Babe. tell me about it.
I mean. hi. these abs.

129
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.877
And they're all mine.

130
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.396
Maybe we could lay off

131
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.960
the public displays
of affection.

132
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.315
just at work. you know?

133
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.550
Since when?

134
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.836
You're always saying that touch
is your love language.

135
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:36.920
That's right. Ralph.

136
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.281
Just feel like we're being
very insensitive to all of you.

137
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.357
Oh. man. we've
talked about this.

138
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.399
I'm over Gypsy. okay?

139
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.437
But I appreciate the thought.

140
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.274
I'll be all right.

141
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.513
I'm gonna go home...

142
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.157
Because I need to think.

143
00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.360
Think?

144
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.070
What are you guys doing?

145
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.360
Following you
into the hallway.

146
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.272
'Cause something
is definitely up.

147
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.834
You need
to talk about it?

148
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.036
Yeah. Barry.

149
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.600
you haven't seemed like
yourself all morning.

150
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.994
I'm fine.

151
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.639
I just think that
maybe I should go

152
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.519
and talk with someone who might
better understand

153
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.717
what I'm going through.

154
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.598
I'm gonna go see Oliver Queen.

155
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.070
I'll be back.

156
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.031
Dig. what are you
doing here?

157
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.395
I'm kicking your butt.

158
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.960
Now get up. come on.

159
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.152
You guys redecorate
the Bunker?

160
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.391
Oliver. you've been to ARGUS
a million times.

161
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.075
Oliver?

162
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.911
I'm Oliver Queen.

163
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.229
Yeah. I'll say.

164
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.834
I'm the Green Arrow.

165
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.590
Holy crap.

166
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.150
I've been hanging
with a tough crowd. huh?

167
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.913
Yeah. you think?

168
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.994
Look. I need to make a call.
just to S.T.A.R. Labs.

169
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.311
just for some important
Green Arrow business.

170
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.119
- You know how it is.
- Later.

171
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.873
What's that?

172
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.839
We've got Bratvas
fighting Bertinelli's

173
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.958
over an old Diaz weapons cache
in the Glades.

174
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.793
I could really use some backup.
Oliver.

175
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.714
Oh. man. I don't know
if I'm feeling up for it.

176
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.056
I think I just
tweaked something.

177
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.416
ARGUS rapid response
is on another mission.

178
00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.000
We're the only ones
that can make it in time.

179
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.351
- Okay. yeah. I'm in.
- Good.

180
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.035
Suit up.

181
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.032
How do I put this...

182
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.476
I forget. do... do I need
help putting this on?

183
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.360
<i>What are you doing?</i>

184
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.256
<i>I thought you were going to fire
an incendiary arrow.</i>

185
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.350
So did I.

186
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.795
Did you freaking see that?

187
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.599
Stop fooling around
and get the driver.

188
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.640
Damn.

189
00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.679
Diggle!

190
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.915
No... no.

191
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.674
Oh. man.
Oh. I'm glad to see you.

192
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.760
Uh-huh. yeah.

193
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.513
Nice outfit.

194
00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.840
This can't be a coincidence.

195
00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.720
There... there has to be
a reason behind this.

196
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.110
which means that someone
is responsible.

197
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.558
We need to know who... hey.
can you... can you not do that?

198
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.394
Man. what a total
<i>Freaky Friday.</i>

199
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.359
No. wait.
we didn't switch bodies.

200
00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.240
It's more of a <i>Quantum Leap.</i>
Where's a mirror?

201
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.875
Focus. just for a second.

202
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.270
and take this seriously
because the world thinks

203
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.875
that you're Oliver Queen
and that I'm Barry Allen.

204
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.679
and I would really like
to know why.

205
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:33.679
- Totally.
- Is that cool?

206
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.599
- Yes.
- Thank you.

207
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.795
I'm sorry.

208
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.119
Weird.

209
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.520
Hey. Mayor.

210
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.957
Just. if you could... just
for 90 seconds of seriousness.

211
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.759
You gotta admit.
this is a little cool.

212
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.797
I will find it a lot cooler
when I wake up

213
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.951
in my own bed
tomorrow morning.

214
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.480
You woke up in bed
with Iris?

215
00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.994
Mm-hmm.

216
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.799
We have to fix this
right now!

217
00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.616
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

218
00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.792
You believe you are not
Barry Allen.

219
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.951
but in fact. he is?

220
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.680
Barry. did you
time travel again?

221
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.870
No. I didn't.

222
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.976
- She's talking to Barry.
- Sorry...

223
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.434
I am Barry.

224
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.274
- Yeah. and I'm Wild Dog.
- Easy. Wild Dog.

225
00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.555
Sarcasm.

226
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.154
It's not great sarcasm.
Cisco.

227
00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.755
- Do you mind if I...
- No. of course not.

228
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.393
Oliver's brain scan
is perfectly normal.

229
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.040
no signs of hypnosis
or psychic interference.

230
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.476
Tachyon meters are clear.

231
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.279
No one's screwing
with the Timeline.

232
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.999
Guys. come on. this is crazy.

233
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.236
I mean. there's no way that

234
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.913
I could be married
to Oliver Queen.

235
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.316
Sorry. but. babe. you know
he's not my type. right?

236
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.120
Iris. you really
don't believe me?

237
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.669
We're telling the truth.

238
00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.558
Okay?
We're telling the truth.

239
00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.439
Something is very. very wrong
with reality.

240
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.520
Yeah.

241
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.195
All right.
Team Flash meeting.

242
00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.280
Not you. Barry.

243
00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.714
Th... uh...

244
00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.199
I've only got eyes for you.
you know that.

245
00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.336
I sw... if you touch her...

246
00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.510
I didn't touch her.

247
00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.398
You thought about it.

248
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.896
All right. well. if
your team's not gonna help us.

249
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.976
then we have to keep moving.

250
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.056
They'll help us. okay?
They'll help us.

251
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.232
We just gotta get... we just
gotta get Iris on board first.

252
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.376
Good... fine. how... how are you
going to convince her?

253
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.039
I'm not. you are.

254
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.958
- She's your wife.
- I know. man.

255
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.056
I know. I don't... I don't
like this anymore than you do.

256
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.736
You just gotta tell her
how much you care about her.

257
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.036
Tell her she's
your lightning rod.

258
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.199
I'm not... I'm not saying that.

259
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.316
Just say it.

260
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.720
Trust me.

261
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.678
It works every time.

262
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.639
Mind if I join you?

263
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.837
Yeah.

264
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.359
This should help.

265
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.318
I guess you forgot
you can't get drunk?

266
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.153
This day could not
get any worse.

267
00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.670
You really think
that you're Oliver?

268
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.479
Yeah.

269
00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.360
You know. Felicity called me
when Oliver was in prison.

270
00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.159
Do you know how he ended up
in Slabside?

271
00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.674
She... she called you?

272
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.150
He cut a deal. Barry.

273
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.038
completely behind
Felicity's back.

274
00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.395
He didn't even warn her.

275
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.791
The FBI just showed up
and took him away.

276
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.109
She said all that?

277
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.396
She's hurting.

278
00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.200
Oliver's life.
it's completely defined

279
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.956
by anger. vengeance.

280
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.876
That's why I am so lucky
to have you in my life.

281
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.952
Are you not
the least bit worried

282
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.350
that reality
might be broken?

283
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.831
Don't you have to consider what
we're telling you is the truth?

284
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.434
Isn't it possible?

285
00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.638
Yeah. yeah. it is.

286
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.313
which is why
I'm really sorry. Barry.

287
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.471
Would you... I thought
I couldn't get drunk.

289

Whoever you are. we need
to get you to a safe place

290
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.959
<i>until we can figure out
what happened.</i>

291
00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.309
I hope you can understand.

292
00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.800
Oh. come on.

293
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.116
Sorry. dude.

294
00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.800
Oh. come on.

295
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.234
Guys. come...

296
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.596
Guys. come on!

297
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.751
Let us out of here!

298
00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.433
Come on.

299
00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.671
Why are we in
your secret prison?

300
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.760
It's not a prison.

301
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.271
It's a Tesla conductor tube
that dampens meta-powers.

302
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.033
Okay. it's a prison.

303
00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.176
We just need
to convince everybody

304
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.157
that we're not crazy!

305
00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.435
How?

306
00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.656
How do you suggest
that we do that?

307
00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.230
Because everyone on Earth
thinks that we're each other.

308
00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.274
- That's it.
- Hmm?

309
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.192
Maybe it's just Earth-1
that's been affected.

310
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.634
If we can get an extrapolator.

311
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.313
breach to Earth-38
and find Kara.

312
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.312
If she remembers us.
then maybe she can help

313
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.550
fix whatever's happened.

314
00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.475
You skipped the part where
you explain how we escape.

315
00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.279
Were you able to get
in touch with ARGUS?

316
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.238
Well. I tried. but I kept
getting interference

317
00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.039
at 650 nanometers.

318
00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.873
Isn't that the wavelength
for red light?

319
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.673
Red light. exactly.

320
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.513
And when I checked
the city's weather cams.

321
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.670
this is what I found:

322
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.274
red skies. yellow lightning.

323
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.477
So you think Barry
and Oliver's shared psychosis

324
00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.756
is a result of weird weather?

325
00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.354
Stranger things. right?

326
00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.432
Okay. I'll run
their scans again.

327
00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.913
<i>You're best off giving up now.</i>

328
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.237
Who the frak is that?

329
00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:46.070
I spent the past seven months
in a maximum security prison.

330
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.517
and no matter how bad
things got... and they got bad...

331
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.035
every cell had a toilet.

332
00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.310
You sure you can't hold it?

333
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.439
Oh. you wanna back up
the pipes.

334
00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.520
And fry the dampener. yes.

335
00:17:59.521 --> 00:18:01.113
That's a good idea.

336
00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.336
One problem. I'm not gonna
be able to reach the valve

337
00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.396
with these on.

338
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.576
You're gonna have
to dislocate your thumb.

339
00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.600
Are you crazy?
I'm...

340
00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.637
I'm not crazy. You need
to dislocate your thumb.

341
00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.000
Just apply pressure
to the joint.

342
00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.256
No. I'm gonna break my hand...

343
00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.336
You're not gonna
break your hand.

344
00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.840
because in this reality.

345
00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.389
your ligaments have been
stretched and conditioned

346
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.711
in the art of escape
by Anatoly Knyazev.

347
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.395
Now. man up. apply pressure
to the joint.

348
00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.551
and dislocate your thumb.

349
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.994
- It worked.
- Yeah.

350
00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.560
All right.

351
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.435
Okay. now just wait for it.

352
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.113
Dampener's down.
Now what?

353
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.576
You're gonna have to phase
us out of here.

354
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.636
What?

355
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.870
Phasing.

356
00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.077
That's when I vibrate
at the frequency of air.

357
00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.816
causing all the cells
in my body to get so excited

358
00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.433
I can pass through
solid objects.

359
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.239
Right. "phasing."

360
00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.595
Want any advice?

361
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.478
One second here.
Barry. please.

362
00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.313
I'm just saying.
it's not an easy move.

363
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.675
<i>and if you screw this up</i>

364
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.056
<i>then you're gonna come out
of the phase</i>

365
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.120
halfway through the glass.

366
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.310
What?

367
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.153
Why are you laughing?

368
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.799
I didn't realize...

369
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.833
- Your thumb looks ridiculous.
- Oh. my God.

370
00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.231
I didn't realize
that's how mine looked.

371
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.437
Well. look at that.
you did it.

372
00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.749
Great.

373
00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.399
Don't leave me. man.

374
00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.594
Figured it out.

375
00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.637
All right. let's go.

376
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.473
Get the extrapolator
and get out of here.

377
00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.075
I can't let you do that.
Barry.

378
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.959
Iris. please. I know
how weird this is.

379
00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.112
but somewhere inside. you know
we're telling the truth.

380
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.317
that it's me. Barry.

381
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.274
Do you remember
when I first moved in?

382
00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.036
Joe brought me to the house
after my mom was killed.

383
00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.318
I looked at you and I said.
"My dad didn't do it."

384
00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.594
- And then you said...
- "I believe you."

385
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.393
You always did.

386
00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.517
And now I need you
to believe me again.

387
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.118
Iris. you're my lightning rod.

388
00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.511
Quick. before
I change my mind.

389
00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.990
We'll fix this. I promise.

390
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.594
<i>♪♪ Somebody save me ♪♪</i>

391
00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.590
<i>♪♪ Let your warm hands
break right through it ♪♪</i>

392
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.515
<i>♪♪ Somebody save me ♪♪</i>

393
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.432
I'm writing it.

394
00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.035
We've been over this. hon.

395
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.316
No. you talked. I ignored.

396
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.517
You need a new muffler.

397
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.432
I think this is
a tie rod end.

398
00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.079
Come on. Kara.
back me up here.

399
00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.355
Uh. no. thanks.

400
00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.999
I know better than
to get involved

401
00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.878
in a debate with Lois Lane.

402
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.553
But you do know the feeling.

403
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:08.237
that itch. that fire
in the back of your head.

404
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.199
the siren song of a story
that has to be written.

405
00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.191
Huh?

406
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.351
Yeah. I do. I do.

407
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.877
The world is gonna want
to know why Lois Lane

408
00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.952
went to Argo City
with Superman.

409
00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.759
Details. I'll make up
a reason.

410
00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.672
Oh. so much for truth
in journalism.

411
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.558
Says the reporter
who writes about

412
00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.717
his own exploits as Superman.

413
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.237
I was the first human
to set foot

414
00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.676
on what's left of Krypton.

415
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.036
to lay eyes
on the Jewel Mountains.

416
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:43.353
to endure the endless.
torturous deliberations

417
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.476
of the High Council.

418
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.914
<i>and I have to write about it.</i>

419
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.276
One small step for Lois Lane.

420
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:52.320
one giant leap
for Lois Lane's career.

421
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.074
Says the woman who is already
the most famous. feared.

422
00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.356
and intrepid reporter
on two planets.

423
00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.911
And yet someone on this farm

424
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.155
is still making 21 cents
on the dollar more than me.

425
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.152
And it ain't Kara. honey.

426
00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.239
You two catch up.

427
00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.757
I am gonna go slam
some small things really hard.

428
00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.280
Okay. just be careful
on that ladder.

429
00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.232
It's really old.

430
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.158
You'll catch me.

431
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.520
Break time. boss?

432
00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.955
I've never been challenged
like that before.

433
00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.110
just to my face:

434
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.396
"Tell us who you are.
Supergirl."

435
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.711
Well. except for Ms. Grant.

436
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.016
Well. and I'm sure
it was harder

437
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.111
when it's the president
doing the threatening.

438
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.998
- Cat was scarier.
- Yeah.

439
00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.677
Do you think I did
the right thing?

440
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.520
Our secret identities.
they protect the people we love

441
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.193
<i>from being threatened
by our enemies.</i>

442
00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.400
There aren't a lot of things
more important than that.

443
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.114
I'm just sad I have
to leave the DEO.

444
00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.080
and now Alex is there alone.
I feel like I let her down.

445
00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.755
Oh. and then I left you
to defend Earth alone

446
00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.069
so I could got to Argo.

447
00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.594
- Nah...
- I'm sorry.

448
00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.434
No. don't be sorry
about that. It's home.

449
00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.080
I'm really glad you
got to see it finally.

450
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.714
connect with it.

451
00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.473
It was more than
just connecting

452
00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.755
with our culture. you know?

453
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.919
<i>I'm okay.</i>

454
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.675
You know. it was Lois.

455
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.355
<i>Everything new that
I experienced on Argo.</i>

456
00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.079
she was experiencing it too.

457
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.916
You know. out there we were...
we were both strange visitors.

458
00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.991
I must sound so selfish.

459
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.640
No. love is the most
unselfish thing in the world...

460
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:39.800
On any world.

461
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.678
Well. about that.

462
00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.197
There's something that I've
needed to talk to you about.

463
00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.674
Okay.

464
00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.080
Wait. wait. wait.

465
00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.256
- Who are you?
- We come in peace.

466
00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.714
Whoa. Lois. wait. wait.

467
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.757
This is Barry and Oliver.
They're friends.

468
00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.840
Wait.

469
00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.196
So you know that I'm Oliver
and he's Barry?

470
00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.511
Yeah. w... why wouldn't I?

471
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.353
Oh. man.

472
00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.440
Okay.

473
00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.637
Um. you guys. this is
my cousin Clark.

474
00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.120
<i>I'm so glad you get to meet.</i>

475
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.873
Your cousin.
That cousin?

476
00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.155
The super cousin?

477
00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.993
Oh. please. call me Clark.

478
00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.231
Uh. welcome to our farm.

479
00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.356
Cool.

480
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.193
Are you puffing out your chest?

481
00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.396
Yes.

482
00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.273
Lois Lane. <i>Daily Planet.</i>

483
00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.716
Wait. why did you guys think
I wouldn't recognize you?

484
00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.757
- Well...
- Oh. uh...

485
00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.960
Oh.
Well. that's new.

486
00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.633
We could use your help.

487
00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.152
<i>All units to Waid
and Augustyn.</i>

488
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.311
Something's destroying
IVO Labs.

489
00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.520
He has our powers.

490
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.159
Again.

491
00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.670
Okay. come on. man.

492
00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.800
I mean. I've been shooting
paint cans all afternoon.

493
00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:19.112
Unless... unless a paint can
rewrote reality

494
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.953
- and made us swap lives...
- I get it.

495
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.072
Then you need actual
combat training. Barry.

496
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.216
All right. fine.
You know what?

497
00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.311
Why don't you go over there.
run at me.

498
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.392
and I'll try and hit you
with an arrow.

499
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.193
Right. okay.

500
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.590
Where did you bury
the remote control bows?

501
00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.399
Dude.

502
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.711
Come on. I'm not you.

503
00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.792
Yeah. well. okay.

504
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.154
Ready!

505
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.839
Here we go.

506
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.273
Nice try.

507
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.959
Ow.

508
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.875
Oh. I've been waiting
four years for that. man.

509
00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.599
Oh. it's priceless.
Hold on.

510
00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.680
Need to get a photo.

511
00:26:00.681 --> 00:26:02.000
- What?
- Boom.

512
00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.713
I got it. don't worry.
Hold on a second.

513
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.595
That's great.

514
00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.830
You think this is funny?

515
00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.713
Do you think my skills
are a joke?

516
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:11.836
Come on. man.

517
00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.798
I was a much better sport
when you shot me.

518
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.918
I shot you to teach you
how to case an environment.

519
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.320
You shot me to get a laugh.

520
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.720
- All right.
- You know what?

521
00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.679
Fine. fine.
Come at me.

522
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.752
Try to get... try to get
one hit in.

523
00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.797
Deck him. Barry!

524
00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.680
What?
He's a jerk.

525
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.479
I'm not doing this.
This isn't how I train.

526
00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.756
Oh. you train?
Really?

527
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.150
I thought your powers
just dropped out of the sky.

528
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.336
If you're trying to get
a rise out of me.

529
00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.360
it's not gonna work.

530
00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.595
Need a peanut gallery?

531
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.456
Can you not do anything
without your wife in your ear?

532
00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.480
Are you serious. man?

533
00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.279
Felicity invented
quarterbacking.

534
00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.273
I don't think that you can
go more than nine hours

535
00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.636
without some sappy
motivational speech.

536
00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.720
I'm not doing this.

537
00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:51.870
Your team betrayed you.

538
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.838
You needed them.
and they weren't there.

539
00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.320
I'm not doing this.

540
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.000
You know. if you really knew
how to use my speed.

541
00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.640
I never could have laid
a finger on you.

542
00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.280
<i>That's the guy who
attacked us at Ivo Laboratories.</i>

543
00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.437
Anti-Meta-human
Adaptive Zootomic Organism.

544
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.354
A-M-A-Z-O. "AMAZO."

545
00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.511
Sometimes these things
just fall into your lap.

546
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.831
It says Ivo Labs
was contracted by ARGUS

547
00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.116
to build a unit capable
of identifying meta-powers.

548
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.675
But he doesn't just scan powers.

549
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.037
He's pumping a nano-adaptive
hybrid of the Mirakuru serum.

550
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.520
So that's how
he stole our powers.

551
00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.478
He scanned
our meta-human genes.

552
00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.200
then used the Mirakuru hybrid
to copy them.

553
00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.397
So an evil copycat Gort

554
00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.120
is coming to klaatu barada
kick-to our asses.

555
00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.113
and we can't let out Flash
and Green Arrow to fight it?

556
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.716
Well. we could
if they were still here.

557
00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.679
Why don't you tell them.
Iris West-Allen. what happened.

558
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.319
Hurry.

559
00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.515
You let them out?

560
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.994
Okay. look. I know what
you're thinking.

561
00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.959
But I spoke to Oliver.
or whoever he is.

562
00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.430
and I could feel something.

563
00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:04.514
Guys. I felt like I was
really talking to Barry.

564
00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.478
I believe you.

565
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.559
It is weird out there.

566
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.718
These red skies.
Barry and Oliver... that.

567
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.400
<i>and I vibed somebody
in the Speed Lab.</i>

568
00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.516
- What?
- Yeah.

569
00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.478
Some guy with ridges
on his head.

570
00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.994
these big muttonchops.

571
00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.390
Do you think that
the red skies. this guy.

572
00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.156
these disparate events
are somehow connected?

573
00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.152
So Barry and Oliver
were mind-swapped

574
00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.039
by a guy with muttonchops?

575
00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:40.033
Man. it's not even Tuesday.

576
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.356
<i>It's AMAZO.</i>

577
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.238
He just entered city limits.

578
00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.033
Don't tell me
you came to say sorry.

579
00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.600
I try to avoid
saying that word.

580
00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.875
Look. man. I get it.

581
00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.794
You were just trying to help
in your own Oliver way.

582
00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.109
<i>trying to get
a rise out of me</i>

583
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.317
<i>so I'd fight like you.</i>

584
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.869
Yeah. it's more than that.
Barry.

585
00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.191
I've been doing this
for a very long time.

586
00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.159
And nearly every time
that I learn a lesson.

587
00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.516
it comes with a painful memory.

588
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.396
Watched friends die.
I've had to kill to survive.

589
00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.840
When I'm the Green Arrow.

590
00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.156
I channel those
painful memories.

591
00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:43.233
I... I draw on a darkness

592
00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.913
every time I draw back
my bow.

593
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.151
So to see you
with all of my abilities.

594
00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.799
just laughing
and joking around.

595
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.678
it pissed me off.

596
00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.274
more than I would
care to admit.

597
00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.319
Whenever I run.
whatever I'm feeling inside.

598
00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.239
grief. guilt.
I've gotta just let it go

599
00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.079
and focus on whatever
I'm running toward:

600
00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.039
Iris. my friends.
all the joy in my life.

601
00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.715
<i>When I'm happy. I run faster.</i>

602
00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.358
just like when
you phased earlier.

603
00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.079
You were having a good time.

604
00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.750
You couldn't dislocate
your thumb until you got angry.

605
00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.792
If you're gonna be
the Green Arrow

606
00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.559
and I'm gonna be the Flash...

607
00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.075
Maybe we need to start
acting more like each other.

608
00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:29.032
Yes. finally. God.

609
00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.797
Super hearing. sorry.

610
00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.314
But I've been sitting in there

611
00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.856
waiting for you guys
to figure this out

612
00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.633
because I have
a lot of thoughts. okay?

613
00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.720
I should smile more.

614
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.473
Yeah. maybe you should.
It might help.

615
00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.756
You guys have to act the parts.

616
00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:43.876
Come on. try it.

617
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.110
What?

618
00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.112
I'm the Green Arrow.

619
00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.600
Wear a mask.

620
00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.776
Sound like that... I don't...

621
00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.356
Cisco?

622
00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:59.878
Hey. Supergirl. Barry...

623
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.912
Oliver.

624
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.150
You believe us now?

625
00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.596
Yeah. we all do.

626
00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.149
Sorry we locked you up.

627
00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.118
But if you feel like
forgiving us

628
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.316
and coming back to Earth-1.

629
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.357
we've got a little bit
of a sitch back home.

630
00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.033
like a please.
for the love of God.

631
00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.077
there's a killer robot
destroying the city

632
00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.355
kind of sitch.

633
00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.033
We could use some help.

634
00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.394
- Let's do it.
- You wanna tag along?

635
00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.199
If you don't. I will.
Smallville.

636
00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.710
Cool.
Who are you?

637
00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.153
A friend.

638
00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.080
Where the hell is Cisco?

639
00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.480
I'm right here.

640
00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.960
And I brought the big guns.

641
00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:10.710
What are they doing?

642
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:11.856
Trying to keep AMAZO
off balance

643
00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.760
before it has time
to replicate their abilities.

644
00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.109
Finish him.

645
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.954
<i>No sign of movement.</i>

646
00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.474
Nice work.

647
00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.632
We got lucky.

648
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.551
Uh. guys. you might want
to get out of the way.

649
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.800
What the hell is he doing?

650
00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.520
Exactly what we wanted
to avoid.

651
00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.715
Well. that's not great.

652
00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.712
AMAZO copied
all of their powers.

653
00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.439
and now it's
on the hunt for more.

654
00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.313
Cisco. there's got
to be something

655
00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.629
you can do to stop it.

656
00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.792
How do you stop a T-3000
that kills for breakfast?

657
00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.557
It's a computer. right?
So just turn it off.

658
00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.916
- I hate it when you're right.
- Well. I'm right.

659
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.354
Let's go.

660
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.717
- It can phase.
- That's what that's called?

661
00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.598
Well. we can't fight
what we can't hit.

662
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.273
I've got an idea.

663
00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.360
Bring him back here.

664
00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.712
No problem.

665
00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.393
Move.

666
00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.552
When he comes back.
knock him down.

667
00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.640
He won't be able to phase
and run at the same time.

668
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.056
<i>Guys. where are we at?</i>

669
00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.120
I think we got it.

670
00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.675
We reverse-engineered
AMAZO's operating system

671
00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.797
and whipped up a virus
to wipe his CPU.

672
00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.360
- Not so difficult.
- Except...

673
00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.750
Except it's a robot
that has replicated

674
00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.240
their super strengths.
and. thus.

675
00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.959
now it is impenetrable.
so you cannot put

676
00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.196
the virus inside it.

677
00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.280
<i>That's not great.</i>

678
00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.515
Okay. so what do we do?

679
00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.115
Look. if AMAZO inherited
all of their strengths.

680
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.556
then maybe it inherited
their weaknesses too.

681
00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.336
<i>Only we're not gonna
weaken it. Iris.</i>

682
00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.800
We're gonna send it
straight to hell.

683
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.998
<i>Oliver. you're gonna have to
counteract AMAZO's phasing</i>

684
00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.520
while Supergirl
and Superman hold it.

685
00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.136
<i>- Got it.</i>
- I'll only have one shot.

686
00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.117
<i>Now. bring me that virus.
Cisco.</i>

687
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.116
Come here.

688
00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.554
Get ready.

689
00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.154
Done.

690
00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.040
Don't miss.

691
00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.839
I won't.

692
00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.560
Hurry up!

693
00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:05.590
AMAZO. you have
failed this city.

694
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.877
AMAZO has been dismantled

695
00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.520
and every piece locked up
in a S.T.A.R. Labs vault

696
00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.472
except for this one.
This is my souvenir.

697
00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.796
A round of applause.
everybody.

698
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.394
<i>Félicitation.</i> Flash.

699
00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.512
That's quite a performance
you did out there.

700
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:58.071
Well. I appreciate that.
but still Oliver Queen.

701
00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.470
And I am still Barry Allen.

702
00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.880
I don't know. guys.

703
00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.111
You took down AMAZO
in one shot.

704
00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.879
Only the Green Arrow
can do that.

705
00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:09.590
And. Oliver. you outran AMAZO.
just like the Flash.

706
00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.456
Maybe we should stick
with this whole body swap thing

707
00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.596
for a while.

708
00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:13.680
<i>Seems to be working okay.</i>

709
00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.456
I don't know that anybody
would be too worried

710
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.994
if you two don't switch back.

711
00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.080
No. no. no. no. no. no.

712
00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.576
We need to figure out who
did this to Barry and Oliver

713
00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.513
and why and then we're gonna
reverse it. okay?

714
00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.557
Caitlin. any thoughts?

715
00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:25.936
I haven't quite figured
it out yet.

716
00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.838
but until I do.
I am confident

717
00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.957
that Central City and Star City
are in good hands.

718
00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.599
Speaking of "in good hands."

719
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.275
I should probably get back
to Metropolis and Lois.

720
00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.829
If anything were to happen.
her entire world's unprotected.

721
00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.240
Yeah. yeah. I get it.

722
00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.198
Thank you
for helping us. Clark.

723
00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.896
We couldn't have stopped
AMAZO without you.

724
00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.230
Oh. not so sure
about that.

725
00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:46.789
<i>Hello. uh. Clark.</i>

726
00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.360
Help a genius out. would you?

727
00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.432
Look. I want to give you
this check...

728
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:53.399
I do this for free. the whole
helping humanity thing.

729
00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.392
Oh. you think that
I'm giving...

730
00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.755
no. no. not for that.

731
00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.638
This is a alimony check
for my third wife.

732
00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.837
She also live on Earth-38.

733
00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.277
and I might be a little bit
behind in the payment.

734
00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.829
If you could just do me
the favor...

735
00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.355
You want me to deliver this
to your ex-wife?

736
00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.079
To my ex-wife.
my third ex-wife.

737
00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.230
You're welcome.

738
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.437
<i>You're welcome too.</i>

739
00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.233
It's super.

740
00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.118
Man. I can trust him. right?

741
00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.712
Are you okay?

742
00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.434
No.

743
00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.236
You did a great job
with AMAZO.

744
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.837
but at what cost. Barry?

745
00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.713
What do you mean?

746
00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.634
Do you know why I let
you and Oliver go?

747
00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.957
It was because
of something that I felt.

748
00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.838
When I stopped looking
with my eyes

749
00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.116
and I started listening
with my heart.

750
00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:55.114
I realized that you.

751
00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.272
Barry Allen.
have always been

752
00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.840
and will always be
the man that I love.

753
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.794
No matter what mask
I wear.

754
00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.554
I'll always show you
my true face.

755
00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.234
I need you to promise me
something. Barry.

756
00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.669
Promise me that when we
figure out who did this to you

757
00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.717
and when you get
your speed back

758
00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:23.999
and you're finally
back in my arms...

759
00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.672
That you'll come back to me.

760
00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.354
Of course I'll come back.

761
00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.672
Barry. I heard what you said

762
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.991
right before
you took that shot.

763
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.832
You're the Green Arrow now.

764
00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.990
But please don't become
Oliver Queen.

765
00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.359
I won't.

766
00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.069
I promise.

767
00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.157
<i>Barry. we need you
in the workshop.</i>

768
00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.275
So you think this person
you saw has something to do

769
00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.776
with what's happened
to Barry and Oliver?

770
00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.120
I mean. I saw him
right after

771
00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.793
these two swapped capes.

772
00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.736
You've been having trouble
with your vibes lately. right?

773
00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.592
- Maybe it's that?
- No.

774
00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.273
This was beyond me.

775
00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.592
It felt like something
important.

776
00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.358
We need to see it.

777
00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.510
Okay. hang on.

778
00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:40.354
My God. I can see everything.

779
00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.160
Fascinating.

780
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.278
I wouldn't have thought
the men of this Earth

781
00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.511
had this capacity.

782
00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.718
But it won't avail you.

783
00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:58.111
None of you can stop
what's been set into motion.

784
00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:01.034
You're best off giving up now.

785
00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:04.591
because nothing you can do
can alter

786
00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.751
what's about to happen.

787
00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:09.954
Are you okay?

788
00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.271
No. not even close.

789
00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.359
<i>What did you see?</i>

790
00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.072
This.

791
00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.355
I don't recognize him.

792
00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.318
Doesn't matter.

793
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.756
I know where to find him.

794
00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:32.349
So what's our next move?

795
00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.794
We're going to Gotham City.

796
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.000
<i>Greg. move your head.</i>
