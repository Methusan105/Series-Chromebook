00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.474
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.836
<i>That dagger he had
negated our powers.</i>

3
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.956
I just lost my speed.

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.680
<i>I'm gonna make this
right. Gracie.</i>

5
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.471
Every meta will die.

6
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.756
So we're dealing with
a meta-human Jack the Ripper.

7
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.038
<i>I give you Orlin
Dwyer. also known as...</i>

8
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.236
Cicada.

9
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.399
How many you shoot?

10
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.994
Shot like a hundred.

11
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.309
Any of them good?

12
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.436
Bof.

13
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.656
Guess we'll just have to keep
shooting till we get it right.

14
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.353
I guess so.

15
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.153
<i>Orlin Dwyer.</i>

16
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.277
Near as we can tell.
he grew up in the Midwest.

17
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.176
In and out of juvie.
pretty much fell off the map.

18
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.271
and then popped up in
Central City a few years ago.

19
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.056
<i>Part-time employee
of Szrek Chemicals</i>

20
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.196
<i>for the last two years.</i>

21
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.696
<i>Foreman says
he keeps to himself.</i>

22
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.393
<i>pretty much a loner.
gave a fake address.</i>

23
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.233
Did take custody of
his niece.

24
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.959
Grace Gibbons.

25
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.736
<i>After her parents
were unfortunately murdered</i>

26
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.353
<i>by a meta-human. now...</i>

27
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.272
So now we know why
Dwyer hates metas.

28
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.320
<i>Once he got his powers.
he started targeting them.</i>

29
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.856
<i>Powers he got the
night of the Enlightenment.</i>

30
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.599
<i>as we all know.
when he was struck</i>

31
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.760
<i>by a shard from the S.T.A.R.
Lab satellite explosion.</i>

32
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.056
<i>Which was also
the same night</i>

33
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.719
<i>that Grace went into a coma.</i>

34
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.316
<i>Where Dwyer visits
her every day. every night.</i>

35
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.631
<i>for the last three weeks.</i>

36
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.393
So he's there now.

37
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.636
- Yeah.
<i>- Oui.</i>

38
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.833
Then let's go get him.

39
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.279
"Let's go get him."

40
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.160
How are you going to do that?
Look. as always.

41
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.799
<i>I respect your spirit.
Barry Allen.</i>

42
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.317
but as long as Cicada has his
dagger to dampen your powers.

43
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.595
there's no stopping him.

44
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.909
So let's destroy his dagger.

45
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.190
How are we gonna do that

46
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.112
<i>unless we have some kind of</i>

47
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.998
power-dampening dagger
power dampener

48
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.196
hidden away in storage?

49
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.953
We don't.
but if we did

50
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.191
we'd come up with a much better
way of saying that.

51
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.317
Sure. I mean. just. like.
dagger-dampener...

52
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.312
Wait. yeah. that's actually...
that's decent.

53
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.896
'cause. you know.
you're running into...

54
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.992
Just abbreviate.
P-D-P-D.

55
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.157
Guys.

56
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.959
What if we could make one?

57
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.193
Make one what?

58
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.234
What if we can make a weapon
more powerful than his weapon?

59
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.993
<i>Cicada can control his dagger.</i>

60
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.200
so what we would need would be
something more powerful

61
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.310
than his connection to it.

62
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.278
Wait. like...
like some kind of

63
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.999
- supercharged magnet?
- Exactly.

64
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.176
I don't know
if we have anything

65
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.600
strong enough for that.

66
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.558
We made Sally out of
a micro-composite alloy.

67
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.233
As far as satellites go.
she's...

68
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.039
she was heavy-duty.

69
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.816
<i>And even if we could
get our hands on the dagger.</i>

70
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.696
we'd still have to figure out
how to take the dark matter out

71
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.520
- to negate its powers.
- Well. exactly right.

72
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.456
I mean. what you're suggesting
is we find an alloy...

73
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.711
No. no. indestructible alloy

74
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.076
that has super-magnetic
properties

75
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.437
but also has the ability
to negate dark matter.

76
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.752
I mean. where are we going
to find such a thing?

77
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.513
The past.

78
00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.276
The past?

79
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.955
You've already come across
everything that we need. right?

80
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.430
A strong alloy with
magnetic properties.

81
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.193
Savitar's suit.

82
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.839
Something to remove
dark matter.

83
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.354
The Speed Force transmitter

84
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.079
that Zoom used
to steal Barry's speed.

85
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.520
Yeah. but that was
his Speed Force.

86
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.000
Yeah.
but those are exotic particles.

87
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.856
which are basically the same
thing as dark energy.

88
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.315
so we would just need some
of that to recalibrate it.

89
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.039
Can... can you do that?

90
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.316
I mean. you'd have
to infuse the transmitter

91
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.800
with the same kind of
dark matter.

92
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.395
Like the DeVoe kind?

93
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.597
More like
the Particle Accelerator kind.

94
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.479
I'm sorry. we... we need to
blow up S.T.A.R. Labs again?

95
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.835
No. no. not again.

96
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.594
We just need to go back to the
first time that it happened.

97
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.558
This is gonna mess with
the timeline too much.

98
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.599
No. it's not. Savitar's suit.
the transmitter.

99
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.831
these are all just
discarded objects in time.

100
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.480
so if we steal them. it won't
affect anything at all.

101
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.632
Even if all of that worked.
we can't just waltz

102
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.756
into the hospital with

103
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.797
<i>our soon-to-be-named
dampening device.</i>

104
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.634
Dwyer smells us coming.
he's gone.

105
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.155
Then we do a time hack.

106
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.993
A time hack?

107
00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.080
Is when you...

108
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.480
<i>Plant something in the past</i>

109
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.637
so it's available in
the future.

110
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.991
You go back.
you take the device.

111
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.992
and you hide it near
the hospital.

112
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.993
Somewhere it won't be found
for five years.

113
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.280
He won't even know it's there.

114
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.030
So you and your father
go back to the past

115
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.840
to defeat Cicada
in the future.

116
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.400
Quite an off-the-cuff plan
you've come up with.

117
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.480
We can do this.

118
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.438
No.

119
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.315
I can do it.

120
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.600
<i>Can you guys figure out
the best dates to go back to?</i>

121
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.512
We're on it.

122
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.736
<i>- You're not coming with me.
- Why?</i>

123
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.480
Every time I try something
like this I nearly get killed.

124
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.336
Well. yeah. all the more
reason for me to come with you.

125
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.256
so that I can watch your back
so you don't get hurt.

126
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.873
It's too risky
with the timeline.

127
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.997
All right. look. time travel.
it's complicated.

128
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.480
I know.
I've already done it.

129
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.756
And look what happened.

130
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.316
Look.

131
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.074
I just want to fix what
I screwed up.

132
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.556
Okay. what I did.

133
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.599
Please. let me come with you.

134
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.114
Not today.

135
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.672
You think she should
come with me?

136
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.439
Yeah. Barry. I do.

137
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.874
Iris. if I do this.

138
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.553
I'm going back to some
crazy times.

139
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.400
Savitar. Zoom. Thawne.
Speedsters...

140
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.949
Who you've all outsmarted
and defeated.

141
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.034
Look. this was her idea. Barry.
Her solution.

142
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.589
And it's a good one.

143
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.399
So. unless you have
a better reason

144
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.915
why she should stay back...

145
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.799
let her do this.

146
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.674
Okay. these are
the best of times.

147
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.717
Incidentally. they were also
the worst of times.

148
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.269
but in terms of going back.
this is it.

149
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.920
Savitar.
When we defeated him.

150
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.496
<i>Barry phased into his suit.
destroyed it.</i>

151
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.150
sending pieces of it
flying far enough away

152
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.630
that our past selves
wouldn't notice

153
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.359
if Barry took
one or two pieces of it.

154
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.999
- What do you think?
- Absolutely.

155
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.536
Barry just has to get back into
the Speed Force

156
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.040
before the timeline catches up

157
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.800
and those pieces get erased
from existence.

158
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.200
I'm fairly optimistic.

159
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.954
Okay. what about the
Speed Force transmitter thingy?

160
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.635
The night that Zoom injected
the speed force into himself.

161
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.056
<i>he left the Speed Force
transmitter</i>

162
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.355
in the viewing room.

163
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.856
Yes. that's brilliant.
all he has to do

164
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.520
is make sure no one's in there
when he takes it.

165
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.990
What about when the Particle
Accelerator exploded?

166
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.816
Well. right before everything
went sideways.

167
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.560
Wells was in the cortex.
and we...

168
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.832
We were in the pipeline intake.

169
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.594
Ronnie!

170
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.559
That's the best time for Barry
to go into the time vault.

171
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.876
He can put a piece of Savitar's
suit in the plinth.

172
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.872
and when the Particle
Accelerator explodes

173
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.714
it should infuse it with
dark matter.

174
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.917
Right.

175
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.512
So once that's done.

176
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.910
<i>we'll have all the pieces
we need to make the device.</i>

177
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.471
We plant it in the hospital.
the rest is history.

178
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.394
Great. let's go show
Barry and see what he thinks.

179
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.116
I'll be right behind you.

180
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.516
Where did I leave...

181
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.519
Aha.

182
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.349
What is this?

183
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.760
What is that?
Nora's journal?

184
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.990
What. are you stealing now?

185
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.515
No...
yes. but for good reason.

186
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.636
Look at this code.

187
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.996
Have you seen this code before?

188
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.037
- Yeah.
- Yeah. when?

189
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.715
Right after Barry came out of
the Speed Force a year ago.

190
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.234
And did you decipher
the code?

191
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.710
Well. my computer did.
just one sentence.

192
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.393
Ah. well...

193
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.359
Hey. listen here.
space invader.

194
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.990
Why don't you try returning
the thing to her.

195
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.480
and then asking her?

196
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.472
Of course.
Of course.

197
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.153
Right.
Makes sense.

198
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.277
Just return the...

199
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.115
All right.

200
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.793
let's do it.

201
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.280
Cool.

202
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.000
You're not gonna want
to forget this.

203
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.319
<i>Had to make some adjustments
to the suit.</i>

204
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.993
but I finally figured it out.

205
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.878
For emergencies only.

206
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.736
You don't want to get caught
running around the past

207
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.116
- in your future Flash suit.
- Right.

208
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.953
You might get ideas.

209
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.635
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

210
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.277
Come on.

211
00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.953
Okay. look. follow my lead.

212
00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.350
Don't go off book.

213
00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.116
If anything goes wrong.
do exactly as I say.

214
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.874
Do things usually go wrong?

215
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.439
What?

216
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.160
When am I gonna get the chance
to do that?

217
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.840
Hey. game face.

218
00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.216
All right. so what do we do
while they're gone?

219
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.400
Do we stake out the hospital?

220
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.536
Get everything ready here
or what?

221
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.233
Nothing.
They're gonna return

222
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.913
to the exact same moment
that they left.

223
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.071
Wait. so.
they're gonna go.

224
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.720
but to us it'll be like they
never left?

225
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.598
Yeah. time travel's weird.
isn't it?

226
00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.871
Here they go.

227
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.713
Good luck.

228
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.280

233
00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.440
Now!

234
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.276
Are you sure
we're in the right place?

235
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.918
Is that Savitar?

236
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.036
That's him.

237
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.274
Come on.

238
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.315
<i>I only have
a few minutes left.</i>

239
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.232
<i>If I am going to die.</i>

240
00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.996
<i>then everything you love
is going to die too.</i>

241
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.231
Holy shrap.

242
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.880
<i>How's it feel to get so
close to your ascension.</i>

243
00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.600
<i>and end up on the ground?</i>

244
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.240
Now I see.

245
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.880
- It's written.
<i>- Nothing's written.</i>

246
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.976
- What was that?
- A Time Wraith.

247
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.176
They protect the timeline.
I've got to get it out of here.

248
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.271
Nora. you're gonna have to get
the shard. okay?

249
00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.920
Meet me in the forest where
we first arrived.

250
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.359
Mom?

251
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.517
- Did you get it?
- Yeah. I got it.

252
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.600
Nice job getting that into
the Speed Force on time.

253
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.915
Nothing to it.

254
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.279
Dad. about Savitar...

255
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.794
This is right. 2016.

256
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.234
How do you know?

257
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.576
Because that was Zoom
with Wally.

258
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.035
I'm about to lose my speed.
Come on.

259
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.359
- Barry. are you okay?
- I'm okay.

260
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.794
I'm okay.

261
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.510
<i>Thank you. Flash.</i>

262
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.040
Jay. stop!

263
00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.237
If you have any humanity left.

264
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.789
then please let him go.

265
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.240
Caitlin!

266
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.200
<i>We gotta get Caitlin back.</i>

267
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.272
Stay here.
Don't move.

268
00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.352
Okay?
Stay.

269
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.112
No.

270
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.316
What?

271
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.676
<i>Barry...</i>

272
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.399
<i>You can't let your losses
stop you.</i>

273
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.034
You're the one who taught me
that.

274
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.360
You have to keep moving.

275
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.830
You have to...
push through.

276
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.877
You have to find a way.
You have to fight.

277
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.670
So that nothing will ever
hold you back. Barry.

278
00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.558
<i>Do what you can. and I know
you lost your speed.</i>

279
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.474
but everyone's here to help.

280
00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.474
My dad. Cisco. Harry...

281
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.311
me.

282
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.670
Come on. Come on.

283
00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.319
Well. you change quickly.

284
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.959
What?

285
00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.350
- Out of your suit.
- Yeah. no. I...

286
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.150
Yeah. it was. just too weird
being in it without my speed.

287
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.856
Well. that's your own
damn fault. isn't it?

288
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.599
- I guess so.
- I know so.

289
00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.034
What are you looking for?

290
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.510
I'm looking for anything
to help me find my daughter.

291
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.159
All right. just...

292
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.239
I don't have my daughter.

293
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.755
You don't have your speed.
Zoom has Caitlin.

294
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.296
and this whole thing... this
whole thing...

295
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.376
is going to hell
in a hand basket...

296
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.073
No. no. wait. wait. wait!

297
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.394
Her frequency.

298
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.709
- What?
- Jesse's frequency.

299
00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.958
People from Earth-2 vibrate
at a different frequency.

300
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.316
Maybe you could track her
that way.

301
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.399
Figure out how to find Snow.

302
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.274
- Did you get it?
- I got it.

303
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.232
Let's build this thing.

304
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.311
You're not going anywhere.
Flash.

305
00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.720
You got what you want.
Solomon.

306
00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.950
And who is this?

307
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.353
Another Speedster.

308
00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.071
No. no. no!

309
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.113
Damn it!

310
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.839
I knew we shouldn't have
done this.

311
00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.314
Now we have no way to stop
Cicada.

312
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.696
I mean. I don't even know
when we are.

313
00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.915
Dad. Dad. we can fix this.

314
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.354
I can't fix this. Nora.

315
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.591
Cisco can't even fix this.
This is Wells' tech.

316
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.816
Well. let's go back to Wells.

317
00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.479
We can't.
Harry's...

318
00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.074
Harry's mind isn't
what it used to be.

319
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.256
No. I don't mean that Wells.

320
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.816
I mean the one that built
the Particle Accelerator.

321
00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.593
That's not Wells.
That is Eobard Thawne.

322
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.034
the Reverse-Flash.

323
00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.713
I know. it's just.
he's really smart.

324
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.576
So I thought maybe we could
convince him to help us.

325
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.080
No. okay. look. no.

326
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.756
The only person Thawne ever
helps is himself.

327
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.433
Okay.

328
00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.957
I'm sorry. I just thought
that maybe...

329
00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.156
What?

330
00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.556
I know when we are.

331
00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.953
- Oh...
- Leave him. Leave him.

332
00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.696
- The less we mess...
- Mess with the timeline.

333
00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.120
I know.

334
00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.834
<i>I know what this is.</i>

335
00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.360
Three years ago
I traveled back to this day

336
00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.274
to get Thawne's help.

337
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.750
So you have done it before.

338
00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.114
Well...

339
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.238
things just got a lot more
complicated. didn't they?

340
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.639
Barry Allen.

341
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.313
But which Barry Allen?

342
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.710
Clearly you're...

343
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.190
- from a lot later than this one.
- Way later.

344
00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.714
Way later.

345
00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.597
Who's your friend?

346
00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.479
Let me guess.

347
00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.994
Jesse Chambers.
No.

348
00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.958
Libby Lawrence.
Wait.

349
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.760
- Danica Williams.
- It doesn't matter who she is.

350
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.999
She's your daughter.

351
00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.313
You've brought me
your daughter.

352
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.511
It's. um...

353
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.116
Dawn. if I'm not mistaken.

354
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.793
Nora.

355
00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.760
Nora.

356
00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.272
Oh. that's nice.

357
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.312
At least you still have one.

358
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.675
Why. Nora.
time travel's so weird.

359
00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.400
What do you want?

360
00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.354
I need you to fix this
for me.

361
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.440
No...

362
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.599
No. if you're here...

363
00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.832
And he's here...

364
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.400
- that means...
- You don't get home.

365
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.630
I get home!

366
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.070
I get home.
I go home!

367
00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:08.313
- I get everything...
- You don't go home. Thawne.

368
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.594
Unless you help me.

369
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.439
What do you want?

370
00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.080
Like I said.
you're gonna fix this for me.

371
00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.117
- To do what?
- Drain dark matter.

372
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.456
- Whose dark matter?
- None of your business.

373
00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.816
- It is my business.
- No. it's not.

374
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.896
There's no chance
that I help you...

375
00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.976
It's none of your business...

376
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.320
Cicada's!

377
00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.474
Cicada's.

378
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.230
The one who got away.

379
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.016
You want to destroy
Cicada's dagger. don't you?

380
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.190
We want to save lives.

381
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.431
You want to save lives.

382
00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.034
I bet you do.
I bet you do.

383
00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.536
Especially your own. right.
Barry Allen?

384
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.234
Look. that me.
he's gonna wake up soon.

385
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.674
He sees me standing here.

386
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.296
your whole timeline
is gonna be blown to hell.

387
00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.357
You're never gonna get home.
You know that's true!

388
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.909
I know!
I know!

389
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.718
Where are my manners?

390
00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.235
Can I get you a cup of water?

391
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.676
So who made this?

392
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.194
Someone smarter than you.

393
00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.476
I doubt that.

394
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.190
You know. Allen.
for your plan to work.

395
00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.016
you're gonna actually
gonna have to have his dagger

396
00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.576
- in your possession...
- We've got that covered.

397
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.034
You got that covered.
How's that?

398
00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.232
With this.

399
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.118
Is...

400
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.750
Is that...

401
00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.719
It's a piece
of Savitar's suit. yeah.

402
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.800
Hmm.

403
00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:07.240
You know what's funny
about your dad. Nora.

404
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.873
is he hates me.

405
00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.280
Hates me with a passion.

406
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.039
and yet a version of him.
this Savitar.

407
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.998
is a much bigger jerk
than I ever was.

408
00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.276
Did you see the face?
Did you...

409
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.278
did you see the. like.
pizza face.

410
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.835
- Can you hurry up?
- Yeah. I'll hurry up.

411
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.720
I gotta tell you. Allen.

412
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.679
using Savitar's suit.

413
00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.989
it's a smart idea.

414
00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.753
It was hers.

415
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.994
Clever girl.

416
00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.714
<i>Oops.</i>

417
00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.713
Gotta go.

418
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.758
I still look forward to seeing
how this all pans out.

419
00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.274
Nora.

420
00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.640
Hey. Dad...

421
00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.110
It's time to go back to
the night it all began.

422
00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.200
Come on.

423
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.674
<i>Tonight. the future begins.</i>

424
00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.513
<i>The work my team and I
will do here</i>

425
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.831
<i>will change our understanding
of physics.</i>

426
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.310
will bring about
advancements in power.

427
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.119
<i>advancements in medicine.</i>

428
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.910
and trust me. that future will
be here faster than you think.

429
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.751
Uh. why are we going
this way?

430
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.638
Why don't we just speed into
the time vault?

431
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.792
Because it's a big moment.
Nora.

432
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.634
Thawne's been planning
this night for 14 years.

433
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.518
If we use our speed.
he'll feel it.

434
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.637
Feel a disturbance
in the Speed Force.

435
00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.791
I wouldn't do that.

436
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.960
<i>Dr. Wells.
the accelerator is primed</i>

437
00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.474
<i>and ready for
particle injection.</i>

438
00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.376
<i>I feel I should say
something profound.</i>

439
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.074
like. "One small step for man."

440
00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.674
What's happening?

441
00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.400
Wells is about to blow up
the city.

442
00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.816
All I can think of to say
is I feel like

443
00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.832
I've waited for this day
for centuries.

444
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.190
Without further ado.

445
00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.596
<i>Dr. Wells?</i>

446
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.753
Are you okay?

447
00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.758
Yeah. I'm great.

448
00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:21.478
I'm...

449
00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.836
Caitlin. do you think
you could have Ronnie

450
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.696
run the Particle Accelerator
parameter numbers

451
00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.720
just one more time?

452
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.359
<i>Just for good measure.</i>

453
00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.591
- Sure.
- Great.

454
00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.433
And. Caitlin.

455
00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.514
the bottle of Dom
we've been saving.

456
00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.716
Is today the day?

457
00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.951
I think today might be
the day.

458
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.600
- I'll go grab it.
- Great. be along in a minute.

459
00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.517
You got us on pins
and needles here. Dr. Wells.

460
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.239
- It's exciting. isn't it?
- Yeah.

461
00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.596
Well. it's all thanks
to the team. right?

462
00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:55.230
Caitlin. fiancé Ronnie.
Hartley.

463
00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.994
- Hmm.
- Hartley contributed.

464
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.118
Especially you. Cisco.

465
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.760
I have to say I have a vibe
about you.

466
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.720
About what you're destined
to become.

467
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.473
I want you to know
I'm very eager

468
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.631
to be along for that adventure.

469
00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.271
Thank you. Dr. Wells.

470
00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.716
That means a great deal.

471
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.600
Oh. did you...

472
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.831
I didn't.

473
00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.480
Shall we just go turn
on an accelerator

474
00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.520
and pop some champagne?

475
00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.478
- I think...
- Okay.

476
00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.840
He's gone.

477
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.400
<i>Good evening. Barry Allen.</i>

478
00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.153
<i>I was not expecting you
this soon.</i>

479
00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.390

You really hate him.
don't you?

Do you not know what he did?

491
00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.797
I know he was your archenemy.

492
00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.118
He killed my mother...

493

494
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.112

An 11-year-old boy.

496

You know why he did it?

497
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.838
He thought if I suffered
a tragedy

498
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.152
that was horrific enough.
I'd never recover

499
00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.640
and never become The Flash.

500
00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.435
I... I didn't know that.

501
00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.760
There's probably a lot
that's happened to me

502
00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.639
that's not in The Flash museum.

503
00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.513
It's why you didn't want me
to come with you. isn't it?

504
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.114
It's not because
it was dangerous

505
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.635
or because of the timeline

506
00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.353
but because you didn't want me

507
00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.193
to know these awful things
about you

508
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:30.399
so it's not what I would
remember most when I went back.

509
00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.479
You don't have to protect me
from this stuff.

- Yes. I do.
- No. you don't.

Yes. yes. I do.

You're my daughter.

Yeah. and you're my father.

Yes. they are.

551

You look like you're having
a day.

571
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.552
Is it 'cause I just threw
your dagger into outer space

572
00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.075
or 'cause you're just now
realizing you didn't kill me?

573
00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.958
We stopped you.

574
00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.238

585
00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.630
Well. he won't stay away from

How can she still come out?

590
00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.720
She didn't come from
dark matter.

591
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.952
so I guess she's immune
to Cicada's dagger.

592
00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.311
She just might be the key
to stopping Cicada for good.

593
00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.791
Maybe we should go

That's really nothing

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.712
But it...

606
00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.957

607
00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:04.112
I don't like to brag.
but I speak a lot of languages

608

and yet this one...

609
00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.034
this one I don't recognize.

610
00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.192
- It's a time language.
- Time language. really?

611
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.000
It's used to record events

612
00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.799
regardless of changes
in the timeline

613
00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.839
so no matter what happens
I'll always remember my dad.

614
00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.879
Hmm. where does one learn

616

618
00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.436
Mm-hmm.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.232
We need to talk.

647
00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.920
Yes. Nora.

648
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.757
Yes. we do.

649
00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.310
You failed.

650
00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:43.118
Why are you doing this?

651
00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.838
You did this to yourself.

652
00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.639
and now.

653
00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:51.189
all of you will perish.

654
00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.874
<i>Greg. move your head.</i>
