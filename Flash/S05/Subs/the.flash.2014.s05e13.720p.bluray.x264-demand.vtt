<i>My name is Barry Allen.</i>

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.998
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.196
<i>To the outside world.</i>

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.192
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist.</i>

5
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.595
<i>But secretly. with the help</i>

6
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.319
<i>of my friends
at S.T.A.R. Labs.</i>

7
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.154
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

8
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.550
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help.</i>

9
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.871
<i>she changed the present.</i>

10
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.475
<i>And now our world
is more dangerous than ever.</i>

11
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.870
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.435
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

13
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.158
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

14
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.640
I want to believe
that there is good

15
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.034
inside of you
somewhere. Thawne.

16
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.713
Let me prove there is.

17
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.496
<i>The shards weren't
dampening my powers.</i>

18
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.512
They were removing them.

19
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.472
We could make
a meta-human cure.

20
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.069
Earl Cox.
Ralph Dibny's gone straight.

21
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.640
So when you let
your new friends down.

22
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.716
<i>give your old one a call.</i>

23
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.792
So you think Cicada
is hiding out here.

24
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.976
<i>just lurking
behind those doors.</i>

25
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.878
It's the inside
of Dwyer's house.

26
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.838
Didn't you have. like.
seven marriages?

27
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.277
I did have seven marriages.
Five wives. seven marriages.

28
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.192
So I'm gonna need you
to tell me right now

29
00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.760
why you're investigating Nora.

30
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.116
I've made a career
out of noticing things

31
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.475
<i>that other people miss.</i>

32
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.317
Who is your accomplice.
Nora West-Allen?

33
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.840
<i>There's always a Wells.</i>

34
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.400
He knows I'm working
with someone.

35
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.439
But he doesn't know
with whom you're working.

36
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.159
- Not yet.
- How can you be sure?

37
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.790
Because if he did.
your father would be here

38
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.157
right now in a flash.
threatening to put his hand

39
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.072
right through my heart.

40
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.040
Eobard. if my father
finds out

41
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.270
you've been helping me

42
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.352
<i>try to catch Cicada
behind his back.</i>

43
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.999
he'll hate me.

44
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.833
- and...
- Shh.

45
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.119
This can all be fixed.

46
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.192
I can fix this.

47
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.634
How?

48
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.910
A man... does not wear
another man's face

49
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.437
unless he understands
his mind.

50
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.830
Not just through time

51
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.072
but across infinite Earths.

52
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.550
This Sherloque. yes.
he's brilliant.

53
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.193
but to redirect his gaze.
one only has to nudge him

54
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.920
toward his weakness:

55
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.160
Love.

56
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.279
Tell me what to do.

57
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.515
Well. what do you think?

58
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.239
Looks great.

59
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.516
I mean. I can move the couch
against the wall.

60
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.910
if that'll help.

61
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.870
Iris. it's just couch in
the corner or against the wall

62
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.600
is pretty much the extent of my
interior design knowledge.

63
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.114
I'm sorry. babe.

64
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.696
It's... it's just.
it's been a week since

65
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.096
I launched the
<i>Central City Citizen.</i>

66
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.760
and I am still struggling
to gain readers.

67
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.390
and I think I just
figured out why.

68
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.836
"Iris West-Allen's first
published articles

69
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.639
as an aspiring
online news maven

70
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.797
bring one word to mind:

71
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.553
'Boring.'

72
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.878
Her stories lack the edgy
content made popular

73
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.191
by sites such as
Spencer Young's

74
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.794
game-changing Spyn Zone.

75
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.112
In short.
Iris West-Allen plays it safe."

76
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.998
Iris. come on.

77
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.434
You can't listen to this.

78
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.000
You're a real journalist.

79
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.760
You don't want to write
like Spencer Young.

80
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.240
She didn't care about facts.

81
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.376
Yeah. but at least
she wrote about things

82
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.516
that people cared about.

83
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.990
like I did when I was
writing about DeVoe.

84
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.759
You wanna write about Cicada.

85
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.440
Fine.

86
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.840
Call me if you need me.

87
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.031
- I'll be at S.T.A.R. Labs.
- Yes. of course.

88
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.316
I've got a lot
of digging to do.

89
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.313
and I think I have a hunch
where to start.

90
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.232
- Mwah.
- All right.

91
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.238
So you really think
this might be it?

92
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.710
Cisco sent me this sample
to corroborate his findings.

93
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.029
and it all checks out.

94
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.430
I'm sending it back to him
for final processing.

95
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.856
but I think we may
have found a way

96
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.917
- to suppress the meta genome.
<i>- Great.</i>

97
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.071
Then we can use it
to de-power Cicada.

98
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.576
- stop him for good.
<i>- So what's the plan?</i>

99
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.160
Put this thing in
a tranq gun and go all

100
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.674
<i>American Sniper</i> on him?

101
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.991
It's not that simple.

102
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.511
So Cisco's breakthrough came
from analyzing identical twins

103
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.576
who were hit by the particle
accelerator dark matter.

104
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.115
cases where one developed
powers and the other didn't.

105
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.192
The key difference
in both cases...

106
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.272
<i>- The pituitary gland?</i>
- Exactly.

107
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.477
In some cases.
the pituitary gland

108
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.677
metabolizes dark matter.
thus manifesting

109
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.319
in meta powers.

110
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.835
So to turn a meta-human
into a human-human...

111
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.391
We neutralize the dark matter
in the pituitary gland.

112
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.954
Except there's one problem.

113
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.111
<i>The cure isn't instant.</i>

114
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.760
<i>We would have to immobilize
Cicada for long enough</i>

115
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.115
<i>for the cure to take effect.</i>

116
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.352
- How long will that take?
- Best guess. a minute.

117
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.480
It's gonna be damn near
impossible to hold him still

118
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.074
for one second.
much less 60.

119
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.873
Okay. but we're so close.

120
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.736
I mean. there's... there's gotta
be something we can do.

121
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.672
even if we have to think
outside the box.

122
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.036
I do have one more idea.

123
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.320
Van Horn Industries

124
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.040
created a peaceful
anti-riot device

125
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.032
called a Neuro-Stasis
Field Generator.

126
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.430
It's basically a bio-EMP
that can immobilize

127
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.080
any living organism
within a confined radius.

128
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.471
Of course. the few devices
they had built were stolen.

129
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.877
I wouldn't even know where
to begin looking for them.

130
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.679
I do.

131
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.752
Can you at least try
not to look so surprised?

132
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.993
Look. if we need this. uh.
Neo-Matrix whatever it is.

133
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.312
if it's stolen tech.
I think I know where to look.

134
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.437
Earl Cox. Ralph says
you've got some information

135
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.715
that could help us.

136
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.871
Well. turns out. that device
you're looking for

137
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.759
has been circulating
in the underground black market.

138
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.479
Sounds like
Amunet Black's territory.

139
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.677
Eh. Amunet's still MIA.

140
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.319
But believe it or not.
her ex-boyfriend

141
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.073
is filling the void.

142
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.392
You ever heard of Goldface?

143
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.039
Yeah. he's stolen
more weaponized tech

144
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.474
than any criminal in the city.

145
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.234
CCPD's been looking
for his black market for years.

146
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.080
Oh. aye. and they'll
keep on coming up empty.

147
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.197
You pay at the market.
and then poof.

148
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.273
your goods turn up a day later
in an abandoned warehouse.

149
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.317
So by the time
we get what we want...

150
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.035
Goldface will be long gone.

151
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.600
Well. listen. uh.
thanks. Earl.

152
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.400
And. you know. try to eat
some fruit or something.

153
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.551
Oh. will do.

154
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.313
Right. then. gents.
See you around.

155
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.357
Hopefully.

156
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.874
Just tell them
Big Raf sent you.

157
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.519
Thanks for the tip. Earl.

158
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.629
I know what you're thinking.

159
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.880
We're supposed
to pay Goldface

160
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.479
and then just let him get away?

161
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.376
Come on. you said we needed
to think outside the box.

162
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.993
This is making a deal
with the devil.

163
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.072
No. this is stopping Cicada.

164
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.197
Look. I don't like this
any more than you do.

165
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.670
but in some cases.
the ends justify the means.

166
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.752
And stopping a psychotic
meta-killer who we are

167
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.072
literally powerless against.
that's one of those cases.

168
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.153
All right.

169
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.600
What we are doing here?

170
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.036
So Jitters has imported
a brand-new oolong tea.

171
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.496
and it's super rare and I
really want you to try it.

172
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.193
Okay. look.
I'm busy right now.

173
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.696
I'm working. all right?
I don't have time for this.

174
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.256
Well. what are you...
what are you working on?

175
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.736
Well.
I'm working on a mystery.

176
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.319
if you must know.
nosy Parker.

177
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.040
Well. what kind of mystery?

178
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.077
One that maybe I will
tell you before too long.

179
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.470
Nora West-Allen.

180
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.155
Great. so. um.
let's grab a tea. then.

181
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.197
All right. we'll have
one cup of tea.

182
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.313
To go.

183
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.275
<i>Tell me what to do.</i>

184
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.072
It's amazing how malleable
the timeline is.

185
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.631
<i>Even the tiniest refinement
can birth a whole new reality.</i>

186
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.996
<i>an object above placed below.</i>

187
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.758
<i>One path blocked
leads to a whole new one.</i>

188
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.311
<i>And if your timing is right.</i>

189
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.835
<i>everything falls into place.</i>

190
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.318
Keep the change.

191
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.040
Whoo! Oh!

192
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.796
Oh!

193
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.872
- Wow.
- Wow.

194
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.952
That would have been
an embarrassing way to go.

195
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.952
My gosh.
Death by decaf.

196
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.360
Flattened by flat white.

197
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.159
<i>This woman is special.</i>

198
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.709
Help him win her love.
and his attention moves

199
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.235
from you right onto her.

200
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.556
- RenÃ©e Adler.
- Ah. Miss Adler.

201
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.757
- Sherloque Wells.
- Can I buy you a scone

202
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.355
or something to repay you
for saving my life?

203
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.750
Scone? Yes. all night.
I mean yes.

204
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.896
- Great.
- Thank you very much.

205
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.230
Um. uh...

206
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.736
What we shall talk about
while we eat our scones.

207
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.399
- I wonder?
- Oh.

208
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.320
Maybe about. given your grace
and your posture.

209
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.238
your years of ballet training?

210
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.313
- Since I was four.
- Hmm.

211
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.437
Wow. you're really
perceptive.

212
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.080
Well. it's a modest talent.
I suppose.

213
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.753
Notice anything else
about me?

214
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.638
Challenge accepted.

215
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.600
Um. well. East Coast girl?

216
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.080
Yes.

217
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.551
From a small village.
maybe. um. by a bay?

218
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.950
Work with books?
A librarian?

219
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.520
At a university?

220
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.910
Live by a train station.
small split-level pad?

221
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.992
You. um. have a dog.
Older dog.

222
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.400
Corgi.
Anyway. about that scone...

223
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.199
- Okay. stay away from me.
- What?

224
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.511
I don't know how long
you've been watching me.

225
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.034
- but it ends now.
- No. no. no.

226
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.157
Or I'm calling CCPD. stalker.

227
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.120
No. uh. Miss Adler.
I...

228
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.839
- Sherlock!
- Sherloque.

229
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.400
Why did you say
all that stuff to her?

230
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.079
You know.
skip the small talk. no?

231
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.072
- No.
- I have work to do.

232
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.994
No. no. no. um. I just... I'm
not really a romance expert.

233
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.356
but I just feel like you
were really into her.

234
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.160
Well. yes. maybe
a little into her.

235
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.074
Okay. so don't give up
so fast. you know?

236
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.629
Maybe you could. um. try
to find a way to say "I'm sorry"

237
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.996
and I could help you with that.

238
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.719
How could one say no to that?

239
00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.832
All right. we're approaching
the position.

240
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.070
<i>Copy.</i>

241
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.936
These are the coordinates
of the black market.

242
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.456
Team Snow and Frost
are standing by for backup.

243
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.513
Okay.
What do we do now?

244
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.079
I guess we say
the magic words.

245
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.278
The streets are
paved with gold.

246
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.136
Maybe you didn't
say it loud enou...

247
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.357
Barry? Ralph?

248
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.834
Uh...

249
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.439
Meta cuffs?

250
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.996
That's right.
power-dampening cuffs

251
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.032
fitted with an explosive charge

252
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.600
in case you're both metas.

253
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.991
- So tell me. who sent you?
- That's really sweet.

254
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.117
Look how threatening
they're trying to be.

255
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.635
Boys. uh...

256
00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.077
We really appreciate all this.
but you can relax.

257
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.480
Big Raf sent us.

258
00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.160
Big Raf. huh?

259
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.072
All right. then.

260
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.119
Gentlemen.
welcome to the market.

261
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.476
So nobody. including us.
knows where we are right now.

262
00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.950
And we are
totally powerless.

263
00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.576
Dude. if we make
the wrong move in here.

264
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.877
these cuffs are gonna be
the least of our worries.

265
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.673
New game plan.

266
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.912
The antihero of our dynamic duo
will find the Field Generator.

267
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.674
And you're just gonna stay here
and try not to look like a cop.

268
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.519
- Or a superhero.
- Okay.

269
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.000
Or really anything
you actually are.

270
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.720
Just go.
I'm fine.

271
00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.714
Hey.

272
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.393
You look like
a discerning consumer.

273
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.160
Might I interest you
in a little firepower?

274
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.192
- No. I'm good.
- Come to a weapons market

275
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.680
and you don't want any weapons?

276
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.116
I said I'm good.
I'm here for something special.

277
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.557
What's more special
than a CCPD killer?

278
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.710
What do you mean?

279
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.056
That's what's great
about these babies.

280
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.390
Burn through police-issued
body armor.

281
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.951
I call them toastmasters.
Try it for yourself.

282
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.080
Can't wait to see cops' faces
when these hit the streets.

283
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.595
Or what's left of their faces.

284
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.957
- How much for all of them?
- Uh. all of them?

285
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.191
There's a limit per customer.

286
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.277
I guess I could ask
Goldface for approval.

287
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.432
No. why don't we just
work this out between us?

288
00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.710
How much will it cost to take
all these off your hands?

289
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.197
Thank you for meeting
with me. Mr. Osmack.

290
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.875
Oh. call me Brent.
And it's no problem.

291
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.270
Any interview about union
reform is time well spent.

292
00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.079
What about workers' opinions?

293
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.056
I imagine. as a manager.
you must get them all the time.

294
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.160
Yeah. I know most of my guys
better than their wives.

295
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.114
So I guess
it must be difficult

296
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.510
when one of them
surprises you.

297
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.320
Like that. um... that killer
that everyone's talking about.

298
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.993
Orlin Dwyer.

299
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.278
Did he ever say anything that
indicated how he was feeling

300
00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.795
or what he was up to?

301
00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.314
No comment.

302
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.154
Okay. well. did he give you
any kind of clue about

303
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.630
- where he might be now?
- I said no comment.

304
00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.279
Did he threaten you?

305
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.113
Look. I know you're scared.

306
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.432
A lot of people were scared
when DeVoe attacked last year.

307
00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.352
But the Flash defeated him.

308
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.909
partially because I wrote
these articles that encouraged

309
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.957
people to come forward
with information.

310
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.680
We can stop Dwyer.

311
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.997
Okay. his paychecks
went to a P.O. box.

312
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.016
But there was a problem once.
and I had to forward

313
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.918
to his cousin's house.

314
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.993
Uh. his name was. uh.
Robbie something.

315
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.198
Robbie... Robbie Byrne.

316
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.430
That's great.

317
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.456
I'm telling you. man.
I don't have the authority

318
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.056
- to okay a purchase that large.
- Uh. listen...

319
00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.231
Excuse me. um. Bartholomew.
a word?

320
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.118
Just a word. yeah.

321
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.680
What the hell are you doing?

322
00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.480
Okay. this guy has got crates
of cop-killing guns.

323
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.176
Would you prefer
he sells them to criminals?

324
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.032
I would prefer that you
not blow our cover.

325
00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.396
and you're going
to blow our cover.

326
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.856
Come on. man.
I asked you to turn off

327
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.633
hero mode for. like.
ten minutes.

328
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.040
Okay. all right. whatever.

329
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.256
Let's not argue
about this here. all right?

330
00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.536
Did you find
the Field Generator?

331
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.710
Of course I did.

332
00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.190
But you're not gonna
like who has it.

333
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.237
<i>âªâª You see these
invisible borders âªâª</i>

334
00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.480
<i>âªâª They keeping people apart
and they giving people âªâª</i>

335
00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.796
<i>âªâª Important signs with God âªâª</i>

336
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.760
<i>âªâª I mean. I'm bored of that.
I'm bored as heck âªâª</i>

337
00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.309
What up? What up?
And welcome.

338
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.232
I hear something special
in my collection's

339
00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.391
- caught your attention.
- You heard right.

340
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.711
- The Neuro-Stasis...
- Neuro-Stasis Field Generator?

341
00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.110
It's a nasty bit of business.
if used properly.

342
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.400
There's nothing proper about
the way we're gonna use it.

343
00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.755
My kind of people.

344
00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.116
Okay. Let's chop it up.

345
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.078
Let's make a deal.

346
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.856
Look. we gonna do a deal
or what?

347
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.880
Shut your mouth.

348
00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.959
Unless you wanna be one-handed.

349
00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.272
Thought not.

350
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.999
See. here's the thing.

351
00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.960
Scum recognizes scum.

352
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.639
I'm scum.

353
00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:43.191
And I've survived this long
by recognizing the same.

354
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.192
Like you.
You're scum.

355
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.192
I sniffed you coming
a mile away.

356
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.600
Thanks?

357
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.720
But your partner.
I don't sniff nothing on him.

358
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.838
And that worries me.

359
00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.800
So the question is...

360
00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.829
Who are you?

361
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.376
Well. I can vouch for him.
He's just...

362
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.959
I said shut your mouth!

363
00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.750
I wanna hear it from him.

364
00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.836
I'm only gonna ask once more.

365
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.470
Who are you?

366
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.831
I'm nobody.

367
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.673
No arrests.

368
00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.592
No convictions.

369
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.558
Not for the Star City Museum
heist

370
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.916
where atomized lorazepam
knocked the guards out

371
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.196
or the acid bomb that blew open

372
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.431
the Federal Reserve
vault last month.

373
00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.636
That was you?

374
00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.359
Not according
to police reports.

375
00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.875
Because the only evidence
I leave behind are red herrings

376
00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.838
for idiot cops to chase down.

377
00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.389
You wanna know who I am?

378
00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.120
You can call me the Chemist.

379
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.989
But I really don't care
what you call me.

380
00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.113
Just stop wasting my time.

381
00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.716
You should let him
do the talking.

382
00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.032
Yeah. I get that a lot.
Uh. so we back in business?

383
00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.272
With a twist.

384
00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.392
Got a big job tonight.

385
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.994
Could use a guy
like the Chemist

386
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.311
to cover our tracks.

387
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.834
You help me get what I want.

388
00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.479
I'll give you what you want.

389
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.233
And what exactly
do you want?

390
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.392
Ivo Labs has this
cutting-edge 3-D printer.

391
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.834
Sold it to some hospital.

392
00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.718
What's so special
about a 3-D printer?

393
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.269
This one prints
artificial organs.

394
00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:54.479
If I've got it. I can sell life
to the highest bidder.

395
00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.552
You want us
to rob a hospital?

396
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.236
Of course not.
I'm not a monster.

397
00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.755
I want you to rob the lab
before it ever gets

398
00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.320
to the hospital.

399
00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.472
Smile. boys.

400
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.870
Tonight you're working
for Goldface.

401
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.871
Best birthday present ever.
Ralph.

402
00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.472
<i>- AllÃ´!</i>
- Oh. good. you're here.

403
00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.075
So since you let me agree to
help you with your love life...

404
00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.230
Right.

405
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.438
I came up with
an unusual idea.

406
00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.960
- Spectacular.
- Mm-hmm.

407
00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.997
I have asked your
ex-wives for help.

408
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.080
Great. What?

409
00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.197
Five women married you
for a reason.

410
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.034
So who better to ask why
they fell in love with you

411
00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.395
- than them?
- Okay. except...

412
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.976
I didn't think any
of them would agree.

413
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.878
but four of them actually
jumped at the chance.

414
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.056
- Of course they did.
- Mm-hmm.

415
00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.560
Because I owe them money.

416
00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.597
I'm behind on all
the alimony payments.

417
00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.876
and they don't know
what Earth I'm on. until now.

418
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.036
- What?
- That's right.

419
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.071
Hello. Detective.

420
00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.197
Hello. <i>chÃ©rie.</i>

421
00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.399
You married the same
woman seven times?

422
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.870
Well. she's the one for me.

423
00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.474
Darling. you can't
run forever.

424
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.096
- We'll always find you.
- You're in violation

425
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.430
- of alimony order 1152.
- Time to pay up!

426
00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.432
- Ladies.
- We know you had Superman

427
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.716
deliver your alimony
to your ex on Earth-38.

428
00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:05.032
- What?
- You think we don't all talk?

429
00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.839
I was hoping
they don't all talk.

430
00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.216
Oh. no. we talk.
We get together all the time.

431
00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.440
- We have to talk.
- Oh. we do.

432
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.073
Except I can never
get you on the phone.

433
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.913
- I text.
- Mm.

434
00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.839
Look. I understand.
You want your money. right?

435
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:20.159
So maybe we can... maybe we can
come to an agreement. hmm?

436
00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.118
We had an agreement.
one that you're currently

437
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.759
- in breach of.
- Uh...

438
00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.354
Uh. ladies.

439
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.955
Ladies. just a big
misunderstanding here.

440
00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.759
Big misunderstanding.

441
00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.096
I thought you were all
coming here

442
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.376
- to help Sherloque.
- Sherloque.

443
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.993
Help him?

444
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.056
You can't help a man who
thinks he knows everything.

445
00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.152
Yeah. like the time clues led
him to believe it'd be romantic

446
00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.913
to release fruit bats
at our wedding.

447
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.196
It's because she support
the endangered species.

448
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.471
so I say fruit bat.

449
00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.233
I do.
I was being thoughtful.

450
00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.755
Oh. for our anniversary.
he bought me a puppy dog.

451
00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.696
That's... that's not really...
That's kind of nice.

452
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.949
Thank you.

453
00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.673
I am deathly allergic
to puppy dogs.

454
00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.656
The dander makes my throat
just...

455
00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.036
It's true. but studies
show that more exposure

456
00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.237
to the allergens. it builds up
your immune system.

457
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.496
so I'm trying to give you
a healthy life.

458
00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.193
Again. thoughtful on my part.

459
00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.840
Well. at least he didn't
deduce that the nicest way

460
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.196
to break up with you
was to fake his own death.

461
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.317
- Ooh.
- Not so thoughtful.

462
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.551
Twice!

463
00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.996
Oh. that last one
really was on you. dear.

464
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.356
Yeah. seriously.

465
00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.711
Look. there's gonna be
a real death here

466
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.917
if you don't pay us
our money back next month

467
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.832
with interest.

468
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.673
We know where you are now.

469
00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.638
Plus. we got a great
alimony recovery agent

470
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.189
by the name of Breacher.

471
00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.397
Breacher?

472
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.800
Ticktock. Sherlock.

473
00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.236
Sherloque.
Where you're going?

474
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.639
- Sherloque.
- Oh. I like how you say it.

475
00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.280
I don't mean
to sound heartless.

476
00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:48.354
but. darling. not everyone
is meant for a relationship.

477
00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.911
Some people are just
destined to be alone.

478
00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.559
Sherloque. I...

479
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.760
We roll out in five.

480
00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.319
Look. uh. I don't have
to ask you

481
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.232
how you feel about this.

482
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.030
Stealing from a hospital.
that's...

483
00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.192
That's way more
than we bargained for.

484
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.078
So if you don't want
to do this. I'm...

485
00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.516
I'll do it.

486
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.034
You will?

487
00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.679
Yeah. what choice do I have?

488
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.880
You warned me to get my head
on straight for this job.

489
00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.110
and I didn't.

490
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.357
You had Goldface ready
to give us what we needed.

491
00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.319
and I blew it trying to get
those guns off the street.

492
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.790
and here we are.

493
00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.270
Barry.
this is not your fault.

494
00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.794
Yeah. it is.

495
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.516
And you were right.

496
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.751
If I wanna stop Cicada.
I can't be so precious

497
00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.111
about getting
the Flash's hands dirty.

498
00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.317
Sometimes the ends
justify the means.

499
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.835
I get that now.

500
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.479
Let's just get this over with.

501
00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.074
Who the hell are you?

502
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.077
Sorry. um. the door
was unlocked.

503
00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.311
I'm a reporter.
I'm...

504
00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.672
Uh. I'm looking for the owner.
Robbie Byrne.

505
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.993
I'm Robbie.

506
00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.070
So...

507
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.153
what kind of story you writing?

508
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.916
It's an investigative
report about

509
00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.070
lead leaking
into the water pipes

510
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.753
in this neighborhood.

511
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.475
Is that so?

512
00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:50.031
Yeah.
Um. yeah.

513
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.430
And it would be. um. very
helpful if you could answer

514
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.479
a few questions for me.

515
00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.359
All right.

516
00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.717
But I haven't noticed
anything strange in the water.

517
00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.280
That's the scary thing
about lead.

518
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.096
I mean. the first sign
would probably be a trip

519
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.554
to the hospital.

520
00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.951
Young children are
especially susceptible.

521
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.635
Do you have a daughter?

522
00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.037
I used to.

523
00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.037
I'm sorry to hear that.

524
00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.112
And what about you?

525
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.998
Me?

526
00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.912
I'm feeling better than ever.

527
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.037
Well. lead poisoning
can present itself

528
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.954
- in a variety of ways.
- Look. it's late.

529
00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.271
And I've got to get
to bed soon. so...

530
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.272
Of course. Mr. Byrne.
I understand.

531
00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.114
Um. I still have
a few more questions.

532
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.954
I mean. I could always come
to your office tomorrow.

533
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.197
if you like.

534
00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.637
Would you prefer I see you
tomorrow. then?

535
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.000
No.

536
00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.431
Let's finish this now.

537
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.793
Making tea?

538
00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:10.111
No. making an espresso
because the mind

539
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.680
needs more caffeine.

540
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.911
Um. that's just hot water.

541
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.152
No. no. it...

542
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.760
<i>Nom de Dieu.</i>

543
00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.076
Sherloque. you know
that stuff your ex-wife said

544
00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.998
isn't true. right?

545
00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.158
No. I'm destined to be alone.

546
00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.597
- No. you're not.
- Yes. I am.

547
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.830
Listen.

548
00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.636
You treat love like it's
a mystery that can be solved.

549
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.396
But you can't deduce your way
to a happy ending.

550
00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:46.356
You just have to let it come
one step at a time

551
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.716
and enjoy whatever step
you're in.

552
00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.554
Okay. listen up.

553
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.710
Get in. get out.

554
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.076
Our guy on the inside
said the place is empty.

555
00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.755
and you all have the code
and the pass cards.

556
00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.833
Switch your weapons from stun
to meet your maker.

557
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.715
Let's go.

558
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.597
Go.

559
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.674
Barry. let me check
your rifle.

560
00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.797
I think it needs a new clip.
What?

561
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.256
Left my phone in there.
Can you check for me?

562
00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:51.078
We gotta...

563
00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.314
Clear.
Move. move. move.

564
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.039
Ralph. there's no phone. man.
There's...

565
00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.312
What are you doing?
Hey. hey!

566
00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.959
What are you... Ralph!

567
00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.474
You're right. Barry.

568
00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.517
- Flash doesn't have to do this.
- What?

569
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.319
But I can.

570
00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.320
Ralph.

571
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:08.595
Hey. hey!

572
00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.319
Ralph. let me out!

573
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.552
I can back you up. man!

574
00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.199
Don't go alone!

575
00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.158
Ralph!

576
00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.833
Ralph.

577
00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.799
I can have your back. man!
Don't go alone!

578
00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.555
Where's the Chemist?

579
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.836
He said something about us
leaving an orgy of evidence

580
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.673
in the truck.
He's handling it.

581
00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.993
All right.
fan out and search.

582
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.549
Signal back when you find it.

583
00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.711
Hey. anonymous
criminal colleague.

584
00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.553
this is it.

585
00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.157
Kind of overkill
with the packaging.

586
00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.919
Yo. this ain't a library. man.

587
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.832
You wanna give me a hand?

588
00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.196
Yeah. how about two?

589
00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:01.955
Sorry. not sorry. pal.

590
00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.191
This baby's going
to a hospital.

591
00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.273
Honestly. I never liked you.

592
00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:10.797
Take this trash out
to the truck for disposal.

593
00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.200
And his friend too.

594
00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.112
Come on. come on.

595
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.834
All right. let's pack it up.

596
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.070
Chop-chop.

597
00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.599
Brick!

598
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:44.716
Ralph!

599
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.316
Oh!

600
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:50.576
Well. thank you.
but for the record.

601
00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.034
I meant throw the brick to me.

602
00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.679
I was trying
to throw it to you.

603
00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.880
I see you couldn't
go through with it either.

604
00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.840
Not after I saw
those little kids.

605
00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.354
Carver's in there
with the printer.

606
00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.631
There's a lot of guns.
We don't have any powers.

607
00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.072
But these do have
a stun setting.

608
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.632
Come on.

609
00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.916
All in a day's work. people.

610
00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.316
- Cover me!
- Break. break. break!

611
00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.960
Get down! Watch it!
Go. go. go. go!

612
00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.256
<i>âªâª Slipping through

- I tripped.

615
00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.671
Let's get that printer.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.399
<i>âªâª And burn
through the witches âªâª</i>

632
00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:34.316
<i>âªâª I slam in the back
of my Dragula âªâª</i>

633
00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.396
I knew all that "Red Dead"
would pay off.

634
00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.551
<i>Good help's so hard to find.</i>

635
00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.678
<i>Both of you. loading dock.
Now.</i>

636
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.075
Go.

637
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.191
Good boys.

638
00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.715
I was hoping you wouldn't
make Daddy use his belt.

639
00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.351
Since you obeyed me.

640
00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.675
I'm not gonna
blow your arms off.

641
00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.479
I'm gonna kill you

642
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.756
in a more traditional way.

643
00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.560
And I prom...

644
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.274
He really should have
frisked us first.

645
00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:46.198
See. that's the thing...
my gold...

646
00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.398
It don't just make me
look pretty.

647
00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.951
All right. Goldie Hawn.
Let's do this.

648
00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.914
Since I'm going into
the organ donor business.

649
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.231
you'll be happy to know
that your corpses are going

650
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.596
to a good cause:

651
00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.516
Making me rich.

652
00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:57.000
Hey!
Why you so mad at him?

653
00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.232
He's not the one that made you
fall for a fake backstory.

654
00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:06.233
Goldface. huh?
More like Fool's Gold.

655
00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.355
Good thing he didn't know
this wasn't loaded.

656
00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.750
He's alive.

657
00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.031
Yeah. and so are we.

658
00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.918
Thanks to you.

659
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.354
The Chemist?

660
00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.596
Well. I. um...
I should get going.

661
00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.514
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

662
00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:02.240
You didn't have that bag
when you came in here.

663
00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.472
We're gonna beat you.

664
00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.154
Well. you got
pretty banged up.

665
00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.550
but your powers are already
working their magic.

666
00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.233
No signs of permanent damage.

667
00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.596
Guess the only real loss
today was our mission.

668
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:07.915
Yeah.

669
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.799
No. we'll find another way
to get the Field Generator.

670
00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.952
And besides. we did have
another win today.

671
00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.556
We took down a powerful
meta-human without our powers.

672
00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.916
That's a good reminder that
even when Cicada dampens us.

673
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.879
we have other ways to fight.

674
00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.278
Hello?

675
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.794
Iris?

676
00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.073
Dwyer's gone.

677
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.640
I'll get Iris.

678
00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.953
I got nothing in here.
Ditto upstairs.

679
00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.176
Yeah. there's
no evidence here

680
00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.395
that points to where he went.

681
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.392
Did you find that
device you needed?

682
00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.313
Maybe we don't need it.

683
00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.952
I know how to give
the cure to Cicada.

684
00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.440
I know his weakness.

685
00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.639
Uh. <i>pardon.</i>

686
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.200
- May I offer you a refill?
- Oh. God.

687
00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.634
No. no. no.
Wait. wait. wait.

688
00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:15.296
I need to tell you something.
Don't be alarmed.

689
00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.154
I am not a stalker.
I'm a detective.

690
00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:21.551
This is how I knew
all these facts about you.

691
00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.871
I deduced them.

692
00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:28.079
It's immodest to say. but I
happen to be quite good at it.

693
00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.994
- Prove it.
<i>- Pardon?</i>

694
00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:33.959
Show me.
Do. um...

695
00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.120
Do that guy.

696
00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:43.238
- Challenge accepted.
- Great.

697
00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:47.678
So if you look at the size
of his drink.

698
00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.070
small relative
to his body mass.

699
00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.392
And the hesitation but also
the enjoyment with which

700
00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.949
he consumes his beverage.
it's elementary.

701
00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.879
This is a man
who has a dairy allergy

702
00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.158
but still prefers
to drink milk lattes.

703
00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.515
but not without consequence.

704
00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:06.069
Oh. wait for it.
And...

705
00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.759
- Oh.
<i>- Et voilÃ .</i>

706
00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.275
- Oh. my gosh.
- Mm.

707
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.398
- You are really good at this.
- What can I say?

708
00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.712
It is a modest talent.
But I must apologize for...

709
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.190
how do they say...
creeping you out.

710
00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:26.638
But if perhaps you would allow
yourself to forgive me.

711
00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:30.350
then I could buy you a tea
to make it up to you.

712
00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.393
Well. I have to go
to work now.

713
00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.153
Ah. all right. no.
But... but I...

714
00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:38.551
- Yes. of course.
- You can call me sometime.

715
00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.640
Really?

716
00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.915
Well...

717
00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.833
- Ah. <i>merci.</i>
- Mm.

718
00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.917
I look forward to.
um. sometime.

719
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Me too.

720
00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.992
- Mm. So...
- Thanks.

721
00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.309
Whoa. oh!

722
00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.754
- Oh. you all right?
- Oh. gosh.

723
00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.136
I guess I should have
started ballet

724
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.230
when I was three.
right?

725
00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.720
- Of course. yes.
- Whoo!

726
00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:00.555
- Okay. bye.
<i>- Au revoir.</i> Miss Adler.

727
00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.473
Ah. you're amazing.

728
00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.680
You're a meta.

729
00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.560
Computer on.

730
00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.758
Close Nora West-Allen file.

731
00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.559
Open Cicada casework.

732
00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.038
All right.

733
00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.232
He will not harm you.

734
00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.677
<i>If your mission
is successful.</i>

735
00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.960
your secret is safe.

736
00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:56.477
And you and I are free
to continue what we started.

737
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.400
<i>Greg. move your head.</i>
