00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.839
<i>- Previously on</i> The Flash...
- You never come back.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.320
You're not stuck here.
are you?

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.238
- Bye. Cisco.
- Bye. Sandy.

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.878
My father's death
certificate.

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.952
The ME who signed off on it.
he doesn't exist.

6
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.600
- So this death certificate...
- Is a fake.

7
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.672
Who the hell are you?
What do you want?

8
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.274
For all of you

9
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.999
to die.

10
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.360
What the...

11
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.756
Damn. man.

12
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.559
Another fight?

13
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.957
Yeah.

14
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.952
I'd hate to see
the other guy.

15
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.633
See you on the floor.

16
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.631
So you're not stuck here.

17
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.552
No. I'm not.

18
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.597
So they will reverse
tachyons in your system?

19
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.036
Were put there
because of me.

20
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.634
Are you kidding?

21
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.456
You know how many credit card
points I just blew just

22
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.472
trying to get rid of your
negative tachyons?

23
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.376
<i>I just bought a brand new
spectral tachyeometer</i>

24
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.518
when I could have
my Fiji get away.

25
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.150
Not that I have
anyone to go with. anymore.

26
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.197
I'm not taking you to Fiji.
Ralph.

27
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.749
Why didn't you guys tell us
about this before?

28
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.479
Oh. my God!

29
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.630
Barry never returns?

30
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.636
That's why
you came here.

31
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.518
To see your father.

32
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.956
because you
were raised without him.

33
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.279
So what?

34
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.440
Iris.

35
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.357
So what that that article
says that you never come back.

36
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.176
So what if the other one says
that you vanished.

37
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.034
I mean. it's said other things
before. right?

38
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.591
We made it say other things
before.

39
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.320
So whatever the future brings.

40
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.672
we're gonna deal with it
when it gets here.

41
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.480
And change it if we need to.

42
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.960
<i>She has a point.</i>

43
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.997
If there's anything Team Flash
is good at.

44
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.232
it's handing the future
its own ass and then some.

45
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.274
What he said.

46
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.238
Well. looks like Nora's

47
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.835
gonna need more training
after all.

48
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.709
Oh. okay.
She's hungry.

49
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.029
Yeah. why don't we. uh.

50
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.635
all meet back at S.T.A.R. Labs.
all right?

51
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.313
Wow. first you meet your
adult daughter from the future

52
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.629
and now this.

53
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.757
I mean. it's a lot.

54
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.273
Yeah.

55
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.680
Well. I guess now I know why

56
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.280
she never wants
to leave her dad's side

57
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.829
and why she...

58
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.479
Never wants to be by mine.

59
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.678
Nora will reach out
at some point.

60
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.832
The trick is you gotta keep
yourself busy.

61
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.391
Yeah.
Thanks. Dad.

62
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.999
<i>Joe!</i>

63
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.039
Cecile?
Cecile. what's wrong?

64
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.720
I can't hear
what she wants.

65
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.751
I can't hear anything.

66
00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.633
I think I'm losing my powers.

67
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.110
<i>Hey babe. uh. it's me.</i>

68
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.317
<i>just checking in. for my dad.</i>

69
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.312
<i>He...</i>

70
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.514
- Hello there.
- Hey.

71
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.990
- What are you doing?
- I was just trying to get

72
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.514
Barry's new suit
into this ring.

73
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.240
Oh. it's... it's tiny.

74
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.996
Yeah? You weren't watching
old holograms of Gypsy?

75
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.197
- Why would I be doing that?
- Because you miss her.

76
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.112
We just had something
so special.

77
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.793
Shouldn't it have worked?

78
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.560
Of course. now it's
not so special anymore.

79
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.718
Now she's just rattlin' around
inside my head.

80
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.190
I'm sorry
this is so hard for you.

81
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.296
But it's okay that you're
still thinking about her.

82
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.879
I don't think you understand.
Caitlin.

83
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.031
I mean. she's literally...

84
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.640
inside my head.

85
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.915
<i>I can't vibe.</i>

86
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.514
<i>Everything I vibe
connects to her.</i>

87
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.991
I put some music on.
I hear her voice singing along.

88
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.311
I'm painting my figurines.
I see her face

89
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.632
on Captains Kirk's body.
Shh...

90
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.518
Do you smell that?

91
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.637
Of course you don't.

92
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.276
'Cause that's her perfume
and I'm only one smelling it.

93
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.875
Of course.
Your powers linked you guys

94
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.316
over pan-dimensional spacetime.
so it makes complete sense

95
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.776
that your vibe echoes
would still be...

96
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.154
Connecting us to each other.

97
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.709
Yes. I know.
Thank you for the diagnosis.

98
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.632
I'm sorry.
You don't need a doctor.

99
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.632
You need a friend.

100
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.156
I'm sorry.
I'm just...

101
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.794
I'm a mess.

102
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.519
Oh. perfect.
Been looking for you two.

103
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.670
We need to talk.

104
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.399
I've hit a real wall
trying to figure out

105
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.039
who forged this
death certificate.

106
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.736
so I was thinking maybe Cisco
could give this

107
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.558
a little bit of a...

108
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.920
Cisco is not available
right now.

109
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.189
Please leave a message.

110
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.192
Oh. hey. Cisco. it's Ralph.

111
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.896
Hope you are doing well.
Just get back to me.

112
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.513
I need to vibe this
as soon as possible.

113
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.875
Bye. bye.

114
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.553
Ralph. um. Cisco
can't vibe right now.

115
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.990
so we're just gonna have to
deal with this a little later.

116
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.879
Why can't he vibe right now?
What's going on?

117
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.714
Because we need
to help him get over Gypsy.

118
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.235
I mean. like you said.
Cisco gets his vibe back.

119
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.755
- we can crack this case.
- Please. stop caring about me.

120
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.991
Ralph. I mean.
you don't have any ideas about

121
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.879
how to help a man get
over a heartbreak. do you?

122
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.873
Oh. my God.
you stop it. girl.

123
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.111
You know I have plenty.

124
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.840
Cisco. you wanna know
why I'm the perfect guy

125
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.118
to help you get over this and
get back into the game of love?

126
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.557
Because trust me. buddy.
nobody. I mean nobody.

127
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.077
has been kicked out of
that more than me.

128
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.475
- Hello. Bobby.
- Vanessa Jansen.

129
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.517
You got out of the slammer.

130
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.398
Now I'm gonna loosen
up that chokehold

131
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.119
you and that punk-ass
brother of yours

132
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.318
have on all the big arms deals
in this city.

133
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.437
I don't think so.

134
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.991
What the hell?

135
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.958
Do you know what four years
in Iron Heights

136
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.076
will do to you. Bobby?

137
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.995
It makes you very.
very angry.

138
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.390
Vanessa.
you don't have to do this.

139
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.949
Vanessa. please.

140
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.672
Okay.

141
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.736
So this is where
the Moretti brothers

142
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.480
- have been running guns.
- Yeah.

143
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.510
Stealing from these guys
takes some real <i>cojones.</i>

144
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.952
Any idea who our
bold thief might be?

145
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.952
Not yet.
Made my rounds too.

146
00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.874
So far the only prints belong
to Bobby and Bruno Moretti.

147
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.120
Well. whoever did this.
they're running fast and loose.

148
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.799
- Mm-hmm.
- If we don't stop this.

149
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.056
a lot of high powered weapons
are gonna flood the streets.

150
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.878
Central City is gonna be
a war zone.

151
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.560
<i>Don't worry about the
city. friend.</i>

152
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.155
CCPD's finest are on the case.

153
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.756
- And you are...
- Nora. CSI intern.

154
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.959
- Who are you?
- The captain of CCPD.

155
00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.999
Captain David Singh.
Oh. I've read so much about you.

156
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.396
It's really nice to meet you.

157
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.675
You hired an intern. Allen?

158
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.720
I am very sorry. sir.

159
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.269
but I needed help with. um.

160
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.272
the cases that accumulated
while I was suspended

161
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.720
and you said
the Mayor wasn't going

162
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.056
to give us any money
to help solve them.

163
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.039
so I hired an intern
to help for free.

164
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.715
Mm.

165
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.440
Well. make her official
when you get back.

166
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.517
Yeah.
Yeah.

167
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.193
I know you're
surprised to see me

168
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.351
but I found this badge
and this jacket and thought.

169
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.477
"I'm a CSI too."
so I should help my dad.

170
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.880
Right. okay.

171
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.416
You said you were still
a rookie. right?

172
00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.716
Well. yeah. but forensic
science in the future

173
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.713
is. like. way advanced. so I can
totally handle a robbery scene.

174
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.952
- Like. not a prob.
- Ah. got you.

175
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.118
- That's great.
- What is that?

176
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.032
That I haven't gotten to yet.

177
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.555
But it looks like somebody
wanted their pound of flesh.

178
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.279
- Nora. wait.
- Wha...

179
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.776
What are you doing?
You can't touch that.

180
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.075
You'll contaminate
the evidence.

181
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.719
Sorry.
you mean you don't have

182
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.156
a scene-wide modified
bosonic frequency field

183
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.959
to avoid cross-contamination?

184
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.078
I don't even think we have
some of those words yet.

185
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.800
Oops.
Well... ugh.

186
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.396
It's just this seems
way denser than human tissue.

187
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.676
Yeah. you're right.
actually.

188
00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.600
I can't even move this thing.

189
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.356
This isn't a pound of flesh.
This is a whole human body.

190
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.558
That is so schway.

191
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.256
Let's hold off on telling
the Mayor about this

192
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.440
until we have some more info.

193
00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.439
She's still be upset
about the Lang homicide.

194
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.952
Hey. Captain.
did you mean Gridlock?

195
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.336
I thought he was locked up
in Iron Heights.

196
00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.397
Iris. it's a pleasure
to see you.

197
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.995
Can we secure
the crime scene. please?

198
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.675
You know I can't make
a comment on the record.

199
00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.595
Okay. well.
how about off the record?

200
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.949
Just once and that's it.
and only because it's you.

201
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.633
Okay.

202
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.239
While in transport
to Iron Heights

203
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.518
the convoy was attacked.

204
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.274
Lang was killed
by something strong.

205
00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.955
- We think maybe a meta.
- Were there any survivors?

206
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.596
Four guards.
They're still in the hospital.

207
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.195
- So if you hear anything...
- Yeah. I got you.

208
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.839
Thanks.

209
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.834
<i>Put this away. and. hey.</i>

210
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.071
- Here. put these on.
- Okay.

211
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.391
<i>You do have...</i>

212
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.753
<i>The Book of Ralph.</i>

213
00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.150
Yep. and we are gonna
start with a page of Ralph

214
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.312
'cause he's nowhere near ready
for this whole book.

215
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.552
<i>"Ralph Dibny's 27 steps</i>

216
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.896
<i>to getting over
the love of your life."</i>

217
00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.400
Are you kidding me with this?

218
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.437
We just want to help
you get past Gypsy.

219
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.159
And if this has worked
for Ralph...

220
00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.469
Multiple times I will add.

221
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.760
Then I think
it's worth trying.

222
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.200
Come on. what's step one?

223
00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.192
Shark cage diving.

224
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.397
- What's step two?
- Affirmations.

225
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.676
- Oh.
- Okay.

226
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.480
Ralphie is kind.
Ralphie is great.

227
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.756
Ralphie is
a brilliant detective.

228
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.559
Yeah. buddy. I mean.
I know all that.

229
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.280
But it works a lot better
if you use your name instead.

230
00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.319
Cisco is creative.
Cisco is good.

231
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.796
Cisco is smarter
than your average bear.

232
00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.111
That's Yogi's.
You stole Yogi's affirmation.

233
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.714
Yeah. I did.
'cause it's a winner.

234
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.712
You don't see him moping
over any lady bears.

235
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.156
Okay. you know what. Caitlin?
I changed my mind. all right?

236
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.152
I... I don't care
about the Gypsy vibes.

237
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.560
I'll just muscle through them.

238
00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.936
let's just help you
with your thing

239
00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.416
and just get me the hell
out of here. please?

240
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.080
No. Cisco.
after Ronnie and Jay

241
00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.800
you helped me get back past it.
Now it's my turn to help you.

242
00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.674
Okay?
So...

243
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.554
We don't have time
to find ourselves in Thailand.

244
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.200
And we are certainly not
watching <i>Beaches</i>

245
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.634
while painting
each others toes.

246
00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.816
That's a really
important one. though.

247
00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.672
But step twelve isn't so bad.

248
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.550
Holy Kafka.

249
00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.199
Come on. Cisco.
change is good.

250
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.272
No. no. no.

251
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.635
Change is pain.

252
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.679
It's not as painful
as seeing you like this. buddy.

253
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.353
Fine.

254
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.597
Whatever you say. doc.

255
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.911
Um. Officer Matthews?

256
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.639
Yes.

257
00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.951
Hi. I'm Iris West-Allen.

258
00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.033
I'm a reporter. and I'm doing
a story about William Lang.

259
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.238
- Gridlock.
- Pardon?

260
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.073
You call him Gridlock.

261
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.880
In your blog. I've read it.
It's good.

262
00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.079
Thanks.

263
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.632
Um. I understand that you
were part of the convoy

264
00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.236
that was escorting him to Iron
Heights when you were attacked.

265
00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.119
- Something like that.
- What do you mean?

266
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.358
I mean. I don't really
remember what happened.

267
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.831
One minute I was in my vehicle.
There was a pile up.

268
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.593
I got out
to see what was going on.

269
00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.032
<i>Everything went black.</i>

270
00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.400
<i>Finally came to and Lang's
laying there on the ground.</i>

271
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.995
beaten to a pulp.

272
00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.151
He was beaten to death?

273
00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.435
Beaten. then stabbed.

274
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.273
- Was anyone else hurt?
<i>- No.</i>

275
00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.272
Everyone in SWAT
was concussed like me.

276
00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.431
So. Lang was the only target?

277
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.719
Looks like it.

278
00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.036
Thanks for your time.

279
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.799
- Oh. hi. sorry. sorry. sorry.
- Hey.

280
00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.998
I just...
I got a little too excited.

281
00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.673
Okay. guess what?

282
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.559
You know my powers have
been fading in and out.

283
00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.074
Mostly out.

284
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.551
Well. I am definitely
losing them.

285
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.871
You weren't that excited
about that this morning.

286
00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.235
No.
No. I was not.

287
00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.392
But I'm excited now
because I have a fix.

288
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.630
I have a fix!

289
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.996
Mental activity dampener 2.0.

290
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.355
2.0.

291
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.711
Harry altered it so that
you can hear the thoughts

292
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.029
of whoever is wearing it.

293
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.759
And why would
we wanna do that?

294
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.230
So we can make sure it works
before we put it on Jenna.

295
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.714
Uh-uh.

296
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.439
Oh. honey.
it's completely safe.

297
00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.776
Harry used it on
his own daughter.

298
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.360
It doesn't mean
we have to use it on ours.

299
00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:38.195
Oh. ok... okay.
Honey. listen.

300
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.432
I have had a constant

301
00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.160
telepathic connection
to our child

302
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.152
since before
she was born.

303
00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.233
It's been constant.

304
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.256
Babe. now when she cries
half the time I don't know why.

305
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.670
Look. she's an infant.

306
00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.717
They cry and you don't always
get to know why.

307
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.757
No. not... me.

308
00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.911
You don't understand.

309
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.714
I haven't been the mother
to a newborn in a long time.

310
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.995
When I got pregnant.
baby. I was so scared.

311
00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.029
But then I got powers.

312
00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.629
These powers that...

313
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.760
gave me a chance
to be a perfect parent.

314
00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.356
The parent
that our child deserves.

315
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.194
And now they're going away?

316
00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.794
I'm scared I can't live
up to that.

317
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.954
I know you're struggling.
babe.

318
00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.952
But that device...

319
00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.158
isn't the solution.

320
00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.709
We'll figure it out. okay?

321
00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.032
But...

322
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.316
I got it.

323
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.715
Ugh.
these old-timey computers

324
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.077
are even slower than the ones
in storage at the Flash Museum.

325
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.800
DNA analysis used to take
a lot longer

326
00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.837
even just ten years ago.

327
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.277
So. Mom took the news
about you being gone

328
00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.840
better than I
thought she would.

329
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.832
Iris is
as tough as they come.

330
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.196
I'm sure you know that.

331
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.273
Got a match.
Vanessa Jansen.

332
00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.914
Low level weapons dealer

333
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.515
affiliated with the
East Street Skulls gang.

334
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.593
I ran into a couple of them
while I was in prison.

335
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.433
- You were in prison?
- Mm-hmm.

336
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.670
That wasn't in the museum.

337
00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.240
The Skulls make
the Hell's Angels

338
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.656
look like a knitting club.
drug trafficking.

339
00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.114
armed robbery.

340
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.431
Any places Jansen's
known to frequent?

341
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.313
East Street Auto Haven.

342
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.154
Looks like it's probably
a front for Skulls activities.

343
00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.551
Yes. I get to take down
my first baddie!

344
00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.916
Uh. with your permission.
of course.

345
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.469
Let's do it.

346
00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.157
What is the hold up?
These are gonna move fast.

347
00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.758
Well. I guess I heard right.

348
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.355
You got something
you're selling.

349
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.400
Too late. another interested
customer just showed up.

350
00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.631
You're looking to buy. Bruno?

351
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.509
From the broad who killed
my brother and stole our stash?

352
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.752
This is way out of your league.
Vanessa.

353
00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.638
See.
I would've agreed with you...

354
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.552
before prison.

355
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.030
But then I got out
and it hit me...

356
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.157
I'm tougher now. Bruno.

357
00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.360
I got connections
with people

358
00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.033
that'll pay big money
for my weapons.

359
00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.396
Except
they're not your weapons.

360
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.794
Like I said...

361
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.591
I'm tougher now.

362
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.040
All right. I'm gonna take
Vanessa and the gangster.

363
00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.536
Why don't you
just scan the perimeter

364
00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.153
for any back up
she might have.

365
00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.596
- I can do better than that.
- What?

366
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.319
Nora. what're you...

367
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.914
Crap.

368
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.590
Sorry.
I can't let you hurt him.

369
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.400
Or take this.

370
00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.709
Didn't know I was a meta.

371
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.752
Don't feel bad.
it's my new look.

372
00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.514
- Vanessa!
- The Flash!

373
00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.432
I guess I better put
my hands up.

374
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.678
How long
do you think it will...

375
00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.873
I think Nora is good to go.

376
00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.679
She didn't even need
an Ibuprofen.

377
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.076
- You sure you feel okay?
- I'm totally okay.

378
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.913
Come on.
let's get back to work. Flash.

379
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.673
Okay.

380
00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.656
All right. well. let's
figure out where Vanessa went.

381
00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.390
If she sells those stolen
weapons to the wrong people I...

382
00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.035
Um. Cisco. were you able
to get the satellite

383
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.555
up and running?
Cisco?

384
00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.831
We weren't able
to track Vanessa.

385
00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.673
but we did find
a scientific anomaly

386
00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.638
that we've never seen
before. right. Cisco?

387
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.671
- Han shot second.
- That doesn't even make sense.

388
00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.116
Ralph. it's you.

389
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.600
Sorry to lie like that.
man.

390
00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:43.277
- We just... we need the CCTV...
- CCTV. yes.

391
00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.115
Vanessa Jansen's concentrated
air squares are dense.

392
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.238
very dense. stupid dense.

393
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.630
The kind of dense reserved for

394
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.757
people who still believe...

395
00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.069
in love.

396
00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.720
I think what Cisco
is trying to say

397
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.031
is that Vanessa can manipulate
the movement of atoms

398
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.079
to created concentrated
air molecules in cube form.

399
00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.470
The space between the molecules
is so compact that...

400
00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.472
That there isn't enough room
for a speedster

401
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.313
to vibrate through them.

402
00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.456
What do you call someone
who can compress air molecules

403
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.314
- into solid blocks?
- I don't know. Block.

404
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.038
So. I guess
Cisco is still

405
00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.376
taking the Gypsy thing
pretty hard?

406
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.357
Well. we're working on it.

407
00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.954
But you can't expect
real progress

408
00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.236
till you hit step 17.

409
00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.391
It's this thing
we're working on with Cisco.

410
00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.790
You can do without us
for a little while. right?

411
00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.480
I mean. we're blind
without our satellite

412
00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.880
so we're just
gonna have to wait

413
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.496
until Vanessa makes
her next move anyway.

414
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.911
What about you? Gonna
hang around here for a bit?

415
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.720
Actually.
I am working on a lead.

416
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.474
- Huh.
- Can I use your lab?

417
00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.358
There's something
I wanna follow up on.

418
00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.238
- Yeah. of course.
- Okay.

419
00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.439
Okay.

420
00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.079
Uh. what kind
of training is this?

421
00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.995
Well. speedsters need
to know about physics.

422
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.675
aerodynamics.
trajectory formulas.

423
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.474
And after your
last encounter with Jansen.

424
00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.394
I think it's time for you
to get back to basics.

425
00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.836
- My training is math?
- Yeah.

426
00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.152
I think chapter one is probably
a good place to start.

427
00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.399
All right.
you're in for a real treat.

428
00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.312
He initially said no.
but after I told him

429
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.800
that your cousin
was John Stamos...

430
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.473
My cousin is not John Stamos.

431
00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.119
...he agreed to take you on.

432
00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.200
I proudly present
my personal stylist. Bruce.

433
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.277
This guy does it all.
hair. makeup.

434
00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.760
He picks everything I wear.

435
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.513
- That explains that.
- Come on.

436
00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.399
Bruce is gonna help us
accomplish step twelve.

437
00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.278
Metamorphosis.

438
00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.216
Does that mean you think
there's something wrong

439
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.515
with me?

440
00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.913
Even a Ferrari needs a
tune-up every once in a while.

441
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.119
This feels like purgatory.

442
00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.956
You cut my hair.
I cut you.

443
00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.676
My work here is done.

444
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.198
So...

445
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.397
I hate it.

446
00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.199
I hate it all.

447
00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.795
Great. Now that that's over
and done with.

448
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.349
why don't we focus
on the death certificate?

449
00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.193
Well. I mean. we
need you to vibe it.

450
00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.478
Or we can ask Joe to do some
good old fashioned police work.

451
00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.640
Did you ever think of that?

452
00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.393
Let's not worry about it.
okay?

453
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.994
No. I mean.
it's a good idea.

454
00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.296
- We'll just. uh...
- Let's give him a call.

455
00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.199
Guys. stop.
Seriously. cut it out!

456
00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.839
Okay?

457
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.400
Forget about the death
certificate

458
00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.915
and let's just focus
on helping our friend. okay?

459
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.480
I need a break.

460
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.040
Okay. so the key with
Higgs particles

461
00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.080
isn't the mass per se.

462
00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.755
but the effect they have
on the mass of other particles.

463
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.797
- Yeah.
- Question.

464
00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.998
How would one go about
performing a supersonic punch

465
00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.151
on one of those particles?

466
00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.391
- Nora.
- Dad. I'm sorry.

467
00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.392
but I already know all of this.

468
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.676
My high school textbooks
had laws of physics

469
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.320
that this time
hasn't even discovered yet.

470
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.676
I don't need
this kind of training.

471
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.400
I need to learn
how to be like you.

472
00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.920
What do you think it means
to be like me?

473
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.795
You know. running so fast
you can stop a tsunami.

474
00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.196
Or vibrating something bigger
than a plane.

475
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.192
Or how about defeating
a sand demon

476
00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.397
by throwing lighting at him.

477
00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.834
Nora. look.
all those things

478
00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.639
are way beyond
your current skill level.

479
00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.952
<i>You gotta stick to what
you can handle right now.</i>

480
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.713
You know. just because
I'm your daughter

481
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.190
doesn't mean you have
to baby me.

482
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.795
I can handle
way more than you think.

483
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.678
Watch.

484
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.554
Dad!

485
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.472
- Dad. are you okay?
- I'm okay.

486
00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.153
I've been hit
with lighting before.

487
00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.436
Ow.

488
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.830
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

489
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.354
I guess
greatness isn't hereditary.

490
00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.435
Body cam footage.

491
00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.876
Officer Matthews.

492
00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.394
Bingo!

493
00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.153
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

494
00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.776
<i>Stay where you are.
Freeze. Don't move.</i>

495
00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.235
What was that?

496
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.873
Hey. I need your help.

497
00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.680
- That's blunt.
- Yeah. so Nora

498
00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.360
isn't really spending any time
with Iris.

499
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.256
So she's kind of with me
all the time. you know?

500
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.033
And I've been training
her a lot by myself

501
00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.351
and I just don't get it.

502
00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.556
I mean. it's like...

503
00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.871
she keeps taking things on
that she can't handle yet.

504
00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.917
It's like she wants
to go big for big's sake

505
00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.296
and I've tried to walk her back.

506
00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.800
but it's like
she's not listening

507
00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.240
to what I'm teaching her.
you know?

508
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.576
It's actually like she hears
the opposite

509
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.910
of what I'm saying.
Why are you nodding?

510
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.480
Are you agreeing with me?

511
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:59.554
Do you remember
your 4th grade science fair?

512
00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.920
Yeah. but what does that
have to do with this?

513
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.276
All you had to do was make
a baking soda volcano.

514
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.760
- And what did you do?
- I...

515
00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.231
You built a robot
with wheels.

516
00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.391
pretty much set
the gym on fire.

517
00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.551
Almost got Mrs. Dumas too.

518
00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.075
- But that was different.
- How so?

519
00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.358
That was the first year
you took me in.

520
00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.716
I mean. you took me
when I had no one.

521
00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.598
I looked up to you.
I mean. you were my hero.

522
00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.319
I...

523
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.637
I really wanted to impress you.

524
00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.679
Bar. all the information

525
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.157
this girl has on you
comes from that museum.

526
00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.233
There're literally statues

527
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.994
of you on pedestals.

528
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.959
How much do you think she wants
to impress her hero?

529
00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.231
So what do I do?

530
00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.119
Well. show her
it's okay not to be perfect

531
00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.554
coming out of the gate.

532
00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.836
There's no shortcuts.

533
00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.799
Takes time to get things right
and that's not a failure.

534
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.997
<i>That's life.</i>

535
00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:09.831
<i>And also show her
that no matter what</i>

536
00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.436
<i>you're always gonna love her.</i>

537
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.718
<i>That's what parents do.</i>

538
00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.399
<i>Yeah.</i>

539
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.870
<i>- Yeah. thanks. Joe.
- Mm.</i>

540
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.395
See you later.

541
00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.151
Mm.
Mm.

542
00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.038
Mm.

543
00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.430
What was that for?

544
00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.796
Just 'cause.

545
00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.792
Uh-uh.
I got her.

546
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.194
Yeah. you do.

547
00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.800
Ah. yes.
the sugary pastry.

548
00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.315
I think as far as avoiding
your feelings goes.

549
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.757
cinnamon bun
was a solid choice.

550
00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.036
You look nice.

551
00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:13.716
Yeah. well. I think Bruce
burned all my clothes. so...

552
00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.678
Hmm.

553
00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.920
Why don't you want
to investigate

554
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.515
your dad's
death certificate?

555
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.109
Because...

556
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.238
if it's true...

557
00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.757
if he has been alive
this whole time...

558
00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.037
It just means
he didn't want to see me.

559
00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.116
Accept that she isn't
the love of your life

560
00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.671
because if she were.
she'd still be in it.

561
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.832
- Pretty deep for Ralph Dibny.
- Yeah.

562
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.354
Granted. it took him 26 swings
before he could hit the ball.

563
00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.993
I don't know...

564
00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.549
I think he might have knocked
out of the park with that one.

565
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.191
Gypsy isn't the one.

566
00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.039
<i>I know that.</i>

567
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.511
And there's no amount
of new clothes or...

568
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.917
crazy makeover distractions
that can change that fact.

569
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:39.155
Because some truths you can
only hide from for so long.

570
00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:45.669
The truth is. it's too late for
me to change things with her.

571
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.511
But it's not too late for you.

572
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.839
It's not too late for you
to change things with your dad.

573
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.876
But what if he doesn't want
anything to do with me?

574
00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.711
Maybe he doesn't.

575
00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.912
But wouldn't you rather
face that truth

576
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.959
instead of spending the rest
of your life wondering?

577
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.515
- Is this part of my training?
- Just watch.

578
00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.232
- Schway. is that you?
- Yeah.

579
00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.959
A few weeks
after I got my powers.

580
00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.152
OG Flash.
God. look at you move.

581
00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.118
Yeah. just wait for it.

582
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.156
And this.

583
00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.240
And this.

584
00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.152
- Yeah.
- Oh!

585
00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.074
It takes time
to hone your skills. Nora.

586
00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.976
<i>You can'tjust can't
just skip rungs on the ladder</i>

587
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.674
or jump right to the big stuff.
It's not how it works.

588
00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.073
All right.
that's enough of that.

589
00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.152
Look. when you first got here

590
00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.756
you said that you weren't
a great speedster.

591
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.311
But obviously neither was I
when I first started.

592
00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:14.280
Um. do you think one day
I'll be great like you?

593
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.152
You punched out a satellite

594
00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.074
while it was falling
to the earth and on fire.

595
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.992
And you were moving so fast

596
00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.549
even I couldn't
see who you were.

597
00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.314
- Yeah. that was pretty epic.
- Yeah.

598
00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.158
I'm sorry I didn't listen
to you today.

599
00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.436
I just wanted to make
you proud.

600
00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.873
Sometimes for people
with our abilities

601
00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:44.193
the most impressive feat
is restraint.

602
00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.315
I want what's mine. Vanessa.

603
00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.400
Now step aside.

604
00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.954
Because you brought
a bigger gun this time?

605
00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.150
Not happening.

606
00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.959
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

607
00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.280
I'm sure.

608
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.400
Hey. guys.
Any luck with Block?

609
00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.199
Nothing. No.
Anything at the lab?

610
00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:33.352
Uh. maybe. It's still
a little too early to tell.

611
00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.477
<i>Unit 7-5-2
requesting a 10-61.</i>

612
00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.040
- What is that?
- Nothing.

613
00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.896
An officer requesting
to go on a coffee break.

614
00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.513
Not having our satellites
is killing us.

615
00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.115
I mean. we can't scan the city
for dark matter.

616
00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.759
We don't have
facial recognition.

617
00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.036
All we would need to do
is see if there are any pockets

618
00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.976
of compressed air around
the city and we'd have her.

619
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.879
You mean gauging atmospheric
pressure like a barometer?

620
00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.736
Yeah. but it would have
to be a big barometer.

621
00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:57.436
You mean like channel 52's
Doppler radar relay?

622
00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.399
Yeah. I mean. Vanessa's
blocks are constructed

623
00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.756
of highly dense air. so they'd
have the same composition

624
00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.354
as an extreme
atmospheric system.

625
00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.035
So. we track the weather
and we find her.

626
00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.952
- That's so schway.
- Okay. yeah.

627
00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.600
Let's do it. yeah.

628
00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.993
Go Team West-Allen.
Yeah!

629
00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:19.232
Okay. look. there's a
high-density low-pressure zone

630
00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.835
in a six block radius
around Pacific and Davies.

631
00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.479
Okay. cool.
All right. let's go.

632
00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.711
Hey. maybe I should
just stay here.

633
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.871
Or you could put some
of that training to good use.

634
00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.797
Last chance. Vanessa.

635
00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.559
To do what?

636
00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:36.994
Just give me the keys

637
00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.536
<i>so I can drive my weapons
out of here.</i>

638
00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.880
Come on.

639
00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.176
Just hand them over
nice and easy.

640
00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.272
Yeah. right.

641
00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.953
Light her up!

642
00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.472
You two.
I swear...

643
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.998
She's getting tired.

644
00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.713
We got her.

645
00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.115
Yeah. we did.

646
00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.473
- Gotcha.
- Uh-oh.

647
00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.714
- "Uh-oh"?
<i>- Flash is trapped!</i>

648
00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.000
What's wrong?
What's happening?

649
00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.992
Barry's in trouble.

650
00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.440
She gets tired.

651
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.592
Hey. blockhead!
Try that on me!

652
00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.312
Bit off more
than you could chew. huh?

653
00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.718
Well.
my work here is done.

654
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.110
Looks like she's a regular
chip off the ol' block.

655
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.236
- Am I...
- Don't.

656
00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.470
Okay. yeah. I know.

657
00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.077
Hey. hey. hey. hey.

658
00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.675
Get her to a hospital.

659
00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.878
XS! Now!

660
00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:03.994
Barry?
What is it?

661
00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.514
<i>- Who's there?</i>
- I don't know yet.

662
00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.589
I just lost my speed.

663
00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.672
- I got nothing.
- Negative. Ghost Rider.

664
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.996
Guys. I know we're
three against one. but

665
00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.470
something tells me this guy's
got the advantage.

666
00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.110
Barry!

667
00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.277
What is that sound?

668
00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:23.551
Oh. my God.
Barry!

669
00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.416
<i>Barry. you've gotta get out
of there right now!</i>

670
00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:30.910
Dad!

671
00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:47.194
Dad.

672
00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.875
- Dad. are you okay?
- I'm okay.

673
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.799
I mean. this is
definitely dark matter.

674
00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.236
but these levels
of concentration are unlike

675
00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.710
any dark matter levels
I've ever seen before.

676
00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.896
Yeah. well. that wasn't quite
like any ass kicking

677
00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.151
I've ever gotten before either.

678
00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.310
That dagger he had.

679
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.676
I think that
negated our powers.

680
00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.798
And he control it too.
like Mjolnir.

681
00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.555
That's Thor's hammer.

682
00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.313
I'm just glad
you guys are okay.

683
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.675
This could've been a lot worse.

684
00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.029
Yeah.

685
00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.839
Careful.
Those cuts are pretty deep.

686
00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.196
It could take a while
for them to heal.

687
00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.077
Cisco.
that's not important right now.

688
00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:52.320
Look. if you wanna know.
this is your chance.

689
00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:57.718
I support you
either way. Caitlin.

690
00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:26.680
I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened.

691
00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.390
Caitlin.
did you see something?

692
00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:33.870
Yeah. I did.

693
00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.598
My mother.

694
00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.034
<i>Hey. guys.</i>

695
00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.512
Let's go.

696
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.957
Hey. we got a big problem.

697
00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.350
So I talked to Captain Singh
and he said that Gridlock

698
00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.636
was killed during his transport
to Iron Heights.

699
00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:01.280
- Gridlock's dead?
- How?

700
00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.635
I'm not sure.

701
00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.016
I interviewed everyone
that was there

702
00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.040
and no one knows.

703
00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.520
But I did some digging...

704
00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.393
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

705
00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.896
<i>Stay where you are!
Freeze! Don't move!</i>

706
00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.598
Okay. so what are we
looking for here?

707
00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:19.400
Not looking.
Listening.

708
00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.993
It sounds like the guy
who just attacked us.

709
00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.311
Sounds like an insect.

710
00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.550
Yeah. it does.

711
00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.393
- Like a...
- Like a cicada.

712
00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.072
Who's Cicada?

713
00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.680
<i>Greg. move your head.</i>
