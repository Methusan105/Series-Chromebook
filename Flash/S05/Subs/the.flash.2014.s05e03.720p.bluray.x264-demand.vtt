<i>Previously on</i>
The Flash...

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.160
<i>We have a kid who defied
the laws of physics</i>

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.879
to hang out with her parents.

4
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.075
Melt.

5
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.456
<i>- Killer Frost...
- Is gone.</i>

6
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.616
The only time you need
your mother

7
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.680
is when you're in trouble.

8
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.240
My father's
death certificate.

9
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.640
The M.E.
who signed off on it.

10
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.313
he doesn't exist.

11
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.936
<i>Now I know why she never
wants to leave</i>

12
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.191
her dad's side
and never wants to be by mine.

13
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.596
I just lost my speed.

14
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.280
<i>Sounds like an insect.</i>

15
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.840
Like a cicada.

16
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.920
Who's Cicada?

17
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.594
<i>As a kid</i>

18
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.558
<i>there was a part
of the Flash Museum</i>

19
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.030
<i>that always scared me.</i>

20
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.994
<i>I guess it's normal
for children</i>

21
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.560
<i>to be afraid of monsters.</i>

22
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.837
<i>But this monster
was different.</i>

23
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.757
<i>No one knows where
he came from.</i>

24
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.718
<i>how he got his powers.</i>

25
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.280
<i>who he is.</i>

26
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.795
<i>All that's known is his alias.</i>

27
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.071
<i>and the last sound his
victim's hear.</i>

28
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.830
<i>But that's not
what makes him scary.</i>

29
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.037
What makes him scary is...

30
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.271
you never catch him.

31
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.355
We never catch him?

32
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.119
Supergirl. The Legends.

33
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.556
even The League tried.
but no one was successful.

34
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.496
Probably 'cause he can dampen
everybody's powers

35
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.035
with that magic friggin'
dagger.

36
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.032
Not all superpowers
are meta-humans though.

37
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.077
- What about...
- Green Arrow?

38
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.839
Yeah. he tried too once.
but...

39
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.879
So we're dealing with
a meta-human Jack the Ripper.

40
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.391
Amazing.

41
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.153
What else do you know
about him?

42
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.152
Just that he...

43
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.560
he's early.

44
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.915
What do you mean he's early?

45
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.640
In my history.
Cicada's first victim

46
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.558
was a meta-human named
Floyd Belkin.

47
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.717
And he never killed Gridlock
or Block.

48
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.280
They're completely different
victims.

49
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.555
Because the timeline changed.

50
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.711
Yeah.
and now they're both dead...

51
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.280
because of me.

52
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.919
Okay. there's no telling

53
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.673
the ripple effect
of this change

54
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.560
or what kind of future Nora's
gonna return to.

55
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.040
We gotta catch this guy fast.

56
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.874
You mean catch the guy
that future us can't catch?

57
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.997
Right. I thought beating
The Thinker was hard.

58
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.956
Guys. it's Joe.
CCPD needs help downtown.

59
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.696
- Okay. I got it.
- No. I'll... I'll do it.

60
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.000
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I got it.

61
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.096
You guys stay here
and deal with

62
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.554
the meta serial killer.

63
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.393
Okay. guys. look.
we've got this.

64
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.358
Let's just canvass
some crime scenes.

65
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.432
interview some witnesses.
and see if there's any

66
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.877
common acquaintances
between Gridlock and Block.

67
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.110
I have a plan.

68
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.193
You... you've got
a plan already?

69
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.112
I know how to fix this.

70
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.990
Now nobody try nothing funny.

71
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.437
This baby is solar
with a zero carbon footprint.

72
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.398
I spent a week
in the sun charging

73
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.234
with U. V. A. B. and C!

74
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.118
So y'all stay put.

75
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.080
Hey. Hey!

76
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.073
I told you.
I brought my own bags.

77
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.119
- Sorry.
- Apology accepted.

78
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.960
<i>Don't forget
the other kind of greens.</i>

79
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.919
What the hell?

80
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.918
<i>Fear not. good citizens.</i>

81
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.469
Elongated Man is here.

82
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.714
Why do I feel like
you're focusing

83
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.314
on the wrong thing?

84
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.119
I just saved you...

85
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.754
okay. if you're gonna...

86
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.120
just don't post... don't post...

87
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.429
I saw you post it.

88
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.354
So your plan is
to contact Herr Wells?

89
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.352
Yes. that's my plan.

90
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.480
I know in the future you guys
never bring in a Wells

91
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.840
to help you catch Cicada.

92
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.475
So if you want a different
result this time...

93
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.392
I try something new.

94
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.759
It's a great idea.

95
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.230
- 'Cept it's not.
- What?

96
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.913
It's a terrible idea.
If you're looking

97
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.515
for cooperation. trust me.
this is not your guy.

98
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.996
He is just an asshat.

99
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.309
That was way harsh. Cisco.

100
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.517
- I'm sorry. I'm being harsh?
- Yes.

101
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.000
Go ahead. call him.

102
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.117
See if you don't get
a steaming pile of side-eye.

103
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.600
Okay.

104
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.871
Yah?

105
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.480
The Flash.

106
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.233
Wait for it.

107
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.994
- I love The Flash.
- What?

108
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.272
Oh. you Barry Allen. yah?
With the zoom. zoom.

109
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.795
and defy the physics laws
and gravity.

110
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.276
Always with some style
and grace. yah.

111
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.397
Thanks. man.

112
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.040
Das Kinder Flash.
Child of the Flash.

113
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.555
Obviously. you have
your father's moral fiber. yah.

114
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.674
And your mother's smarts.
and classic beauty.

115
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.877
- Oh. my God. Stop.
- Thank you. Herr Wells.

116
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.872
No. don't thank him.

117
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.633
Don't fall for this ruse.

118
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.110
Clearly this guy
is putting on an act.

119
00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.236
He's a charlatan.

120
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.750
But you hurt me.
stab me in the back.

121
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.593
this guy who must be Cisco.

122
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.558
- You know who I am.
- Hey. don't be rude.

123
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.074
All right. look.
Hey. I'm sorry.

124
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.600
We need your help catching

125
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.354
a meta-human serial killer.

126
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.033
Yeah.
I have heard of this Cicada.

127
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.476
Of course. the message already
from Kinder Flash.

128
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.631
Unfortunately.
I'm otherwise occupied.

129
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.200
unable to assist you
at this time.

130
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.680
- You can't?
<i>- Nein.</i>

131
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.080
But. I have done one better

132
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.514
and called someone who can.

133
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.956
This man is a legend.
this man is

134
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.158
the greatest detective
in all the Multiverse.

135
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.152
So I've attached
his coordinates

136
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.656
- if you want to look at them.
- Okay.

137
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.797
- Yah. do you see it?
- Got 'em.

138
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.872
- Good.
- Cisco.

139
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.456
Cisco what?
You want me to breach him here?

140
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.676
- Yeah.
- Hello? I just got Benihana'd.

141
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.160
- Hurts a little bit.
- Sorry.

142
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.976
Why don't we just breach him
here the old fashioned way?

143
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.469
Hey. man. thank you for this.
This is great.

144
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.836
Privilege and an honor
to help The Flash. yah.

145
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.879
and Kinder Flash.
and Iris Flash. yah.

146
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.235
Bye. Kinder Flash.

147
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.959
Bye. Herr Wells.

148
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.400
Nice guy.

149
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.656
What are you talking about.
man?

150
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.399
- He's awesome.
- He's not...

151
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.073
You know what?

152
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.640
Let's just turn on
the extrapolator

153
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.473
and get this master detective
out here.

154
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.354
Well...

155
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.030
I imagined your Earth
would be colder.

156
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.949
Harrison Sherloque Wells

157
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.360
at your service.

158
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.152
I'm here to catch your killer.

159
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.837
Barry. what is he doing?

160
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.536
I don't know.
Maybe it's some kind

161
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.313
- of CSI kit?
<i>- Et voilà.</i>

162
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.960
Shh.
Just let him...

163
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.953
Mmm.
That's the stuff.

164
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.355
And now we can begin.

165
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.794
- Tea?
- That's right.

166
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.400
We've been watching you
for 20 minutes.

167
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.234
You're welcome.

168
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.960
- Cannot rush excellence.
- This is a waste of time.

169
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.555
Thank you very much for coming.
Cumberbatch.

170
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.997
I'm sure you would like it
if I took my leave. right?

171
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.993
Could have more time to recover
from your recent heartbreak.

172
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.639
What are you talking about?

173
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.552
Subcutaneous
under-eye bruising.

174
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.916
which indicates
you've been crying.

175
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.992
Flaky skin.
which indicates dehydration.

176
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.390
probably from
alcohol consumption.

177
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.439
Alcohol plus crying
can only mean one thing.

178
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.318
You have been dumped.

179
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.595
Wrong. detective.

180
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.751
- I have not been dumped.
- Oh. no?

181
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.674
It was a mutual decision.
okay?

182
00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.960
Cynthia and I. we reached
a decision together as a team.

183
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.440
Sure.
Of course.

184
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.318
Okay. and I haven't been
sobbing.

185
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.518
In fact. I can't remember
the last time I cried about it.

186
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.398
Excuse me.

187
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.911
You are the resident speedster.
I presume?

188
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.320
How did you...
Who favors stopping

189
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.720
on his right heel?

190
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.395
Can tell from the wear and tear
on your footwear.

191
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.598
It's uneven.
A trait that you have inherited

192
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.399
from your father.
Although you do share

193
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.056
a little bit more body language
with your mother.

194
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.639
who's been touching
her left shoulder

195
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.840
since I came around here.
What are you hiding from me?

196
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.070
Excuse me?

197
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.719
I am not hiding anything.

198
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.871
Oh. no. no. no. no. no.
Yes. you are. but what?

199
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.998
You have touched it. like...

200
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.753
it's something there.
then gone again.

201
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.877
something removed.
A tattoo. right?

202
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.429
Yes. perhaps from
a former lover?

203
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.920
Okay!
You know what?

204
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.437
I think that this Sherloque
has proven himself

205
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.558
and that we should start
finding Cicada.

206
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.109
Excellent.
Let's find Cicada.

207
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.760
But first.
the question of my fee.

208
00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.990
You're charging us?

209
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.549
This service is not free.
right?

210
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.279
I don't work for charity.

211
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.919
Can already tell
the young doctor here

212
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.276
is expecting to hire me
for another case.

213
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.714
I saw you glance at your purse.

214
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.256
and I'm happy to assist you
in that mystery.

215
00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.158
But first.
I think we can all agree

216
00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.280
that a villain
of Cicada's caliber...

217
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.239
will require a substantial fee.

218
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.913
Yeah.

219
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.232
Shrap. that's a lot of money
even from when I'm from.

220
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.993
I'm very expensive.
but very worth it.

221
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.719
What do you think?

222
00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.639
I mean. we could sell off
some of S.T.A.R. Labs stock.

223
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.191
- Yes! We have an agreement.
- Yeah.

224
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.033
Do you hear that?

225
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.430
Sounds of these frantic steps.
we're being approached

226
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.752
either by a tall.
sensitive man. or...

227
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.479
a frightened baby giraffe.

228
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.911
I got... I got a problem here.
guys. and I...

229
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.120
- Hey.
- Hello. baby giraffe.

230
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.197
Harry. how are you?

231
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.556
This is Sherloque Wells.

232
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.600
Loque.
Sherloque. "L-O-Q-U-E."

233
00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.876
Sherloque.
I'm French.

234
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.456
- "Sher-lowk" here is...
- Loque.

235
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.120
Is gonna help us find Cicada.

236
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.669
Oh. cool.
so you're like a detective.

237
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.116
Oh. detective. the fans.

238
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.271
Who should I make
the autograph out to?

239
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.999
Little baby giraffe.

240
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.037
Uh. no. no. no.
I'm... I'm... listen.

241
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.440
I'm a detective as well.

242
00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.796
Yeah. Yeah.

243
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.954
Ah. well...

244
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.560
That's right. well.
you're a detective.

245
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.472
What... what have you solved
recently?

246
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.796
Most recently?
I uncovered the case

247
00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.553
of the stolen Chevy.

248
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.834
Of Impala.

249
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.718
Funny.
Hmm.

250
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.110
Very funny
from the looks of things.

251
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.240
- Whoa.
- Okay.

252
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.515
so I saved all these hostages

253
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.831
and... and all anybody can talk
about is this picture.

254
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.799
and it turned into a meme.
And... and... it's...

255
00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.190
this is... I just... I don't think
anybody in this city

256
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.873
takes me seriously.

257
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.231
Oh. there's 14 million people
in this city.

258
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.360
Only 500.000
have reposted this.

259
00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.238
Yeah.

260
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.233
So. uh... Cicada?

261
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.390
Cicada. yes.

262
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.994
I've reviewed your evidence

263
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.719
and I know
where to find your killer.

264
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.156
So. shall we? Let's get this
done before dinner. right?

265
00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.594
All right. <i>allons-y.</i>

266
00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.956
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

267
00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.520
Not so fast. baby giraffe.

268
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.479
Two detectives
only complicates matters.

269
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.075
Especially when only one
is a master.

270
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.117
So why don't you stay put?

271
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.517
You can... bite the leaves.
Everyone else. come with me.

272
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.959
You okay?
Hmm?

273
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.474
Oh. yeah.
I'm...

274
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.358
Yeah. I'm... I'm great.
I just got shut down

275
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.671
by Jean-Claude Van Damme.

276
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.433
You know Cicada's
not the only mystery

277
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.954
around here that needs solving.

278
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.193
Yeah.

279
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.437
<i>Mom. I know it sounds crazy.</i>

280
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.719
but we think someone forged
Dad's death certificate.

281
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.837
Have you any proof?

282
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.834
No. well. yes. sort of.

283
00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.798
It's complicated. but

284
00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.156
I just thought you should know.

285
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.038
- Unless I already knew.
- I didn't say that.

286
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.560
It's why you're here.
isn't it?

287
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.199
If this is some elaborate.

288
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.760
possibly nefarious cover-up.

289
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.160
it must be Mom's doing.

290
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.390
It's not like she's ever

291
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.800
had your best interests
at heart.

292
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.957
You always do this.

293
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.216
<i>I just want to know the truth.</i>

294
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.471
I think I deserve to know that.

295
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.199
Is...

296
00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.396
my dad even really...

297
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.199
Caitlin. your father is dead.

298
00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.078
And if you care about
my feelings at all.

299
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.959
you'll just let this be.

300
00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.631
Thanks. mom.
Pleasure as always.

301
00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.837
Don't become obsessed
with the past.

302
00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.311
Your father had that flaw.
It nearly led to his ruin

303
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.119
even before his death.

304
00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.197
I trust you know the way out.

305
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.238
I'm sorry we came

306
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.800
all this way for no reason.

307
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.191
No. I'm impressed.
Your mom is a really good liar.

308
00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.511
Yeah. I know she forged
this death certificate.

309
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.434
I just...
She's never gonna tell us why.

310
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.113
We've hit a brick wall.

311
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.793
Ah. but where you see a wall

312
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.430
this detective sees
a brick door with no handle.

313
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.070
What I mean is I know exactly
how to get what we came for.

314
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.056
- You sure he's in there?
<i>- I'm certain.</i>

315
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.436
Now. your evidence.
while slight.

316
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.671
was enough to build
a psychological profile.

317
00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.956
This is a man hiding
in the shadows.

318
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.151
<i>This is someone
who's been pushed</i>

319
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.118
<i>to the peripheries of society.</i>

320
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.157
and then now he sits alone

321
00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.436
<i>waiting for the moment
to strike.</i>

322
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.080
All this.
plus the census data

323
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.073
cross-referenced with
the location of his attacks.

324
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.949
and the profile narrows
to one name...

325
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.032
David Hersch.

326
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.554
Nora's plan might
actually work.

327
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.359
Or it will work.

328
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.519
Once inside. you should find
a small booby trap.

329
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.920
I found it.

330
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.798
I'm on it.

331
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.519
<i>Here is the critical part.</i>

332
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.159
It's a decoy.

333
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.310
Sorry.
I got caught off-guard.

334
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.675
Not so tough without
your dagger. huh?

335
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.314
We got him.

336
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.834
<i>That's ridiculous!</i>

337
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.435
<i>I don't know what
you're talking about.</i>

338
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.153
<i>You don't got anything on me!</i>

339
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.232
- Well. he sounds angry.
- Yeah.

340
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.039
Forensics examined
Hersch's hideout

341
00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.480
and they found evidence
linking him

342
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.119
to several anti-government
bombings.

343
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.998
He's been doing it for a while.

344
00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.958
- So we got him.
- I don't know.

345
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.997
They didn't find
any sign of his dagger

346
00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.080
or his mask.

347
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.556
Dad. one CSI to another.

348
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.632
look at the facts. okay?

349
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.792
Sherloque is the best detective
in the Multiverse.

350
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.473
His profile led us
to David Hersch.

351
00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.896
and we found evidence
that David Hersch

352
00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.115
is a mass murderer.

353
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.590
What are the chances
that this isn't our guy?

354
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.036
- I mean. maybe.
- Come on. we should celebrate.

355
00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.376
Okay. I'm gonna gather
everyone up.

356
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.400
mix some drinks.

357
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.720
and we can have our first party

358
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.256
- in the new lounge.
- I don't know. Nora.

359
00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.714
I...

360
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.873
Detective Joseph West.

361
00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.030
What do you want?

362
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.670
To finish what I started.

363
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.070
The meta-human called Vibe.

364
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.073
Call him here now.

365
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.873
I can't.
I don't even know him.

366
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.998
You were saying?

367
00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.869
Yes. I mean. he helps CCPD.

368
00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.953
but it's not like I have
a Vibe phone

369
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.759
so I can just call him up.

370
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.991
He's just a masked do-gooder

371
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.719
that shows up at crime scenes.

372
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.995
This could be a crime scene.

373
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.638
<i>When you said you had
a plan. Ralph.</i>

374
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.056
I didn't think you meant
breaking and entering

375
00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.959
into my mother's company
files.

376
00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.880
Reinforced steel.

377
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.429
It's times like this
I really miss Killer Frost.

378
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.113
Oh. don't you worry.

379
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.316
Ralphie's got it.

380
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.595
Okay.

381
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.672
Yep.
Almost there.

382
00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.031
Hang on.
Yeah. almost got it.

383
00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.793
Oh. my God.

384
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.394
- What is it?
- Lasers.

385
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.551
Room's filled with lasers!

386
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.552
Holy snakies.
Oh. my God.

387
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.920
It's like
a Rubik's Cube of pain.

388
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.229
I don't know the code.

389
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.754
Try something

390
00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.160
that your mother would...

391
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.112
Caitlin!
There's gotta be something.

392
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.429
Got it.

393
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.874
You okay?

394
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.395
Nothing a gallon of Aloe
won't fix.

395
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.516
Ooh.

396
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.636
Look for the name
Thomas Snow.

397
00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.794
Jackpot.

398
00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.880
What is that?

399
00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.919
It's a game my dad
and I used to play.

400
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.038
He would teach me
the periodic table. but...

401
00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.554
he would let me make up

402
00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.711
my own fictional compounds
and elements.

403
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.075
Nerd-onium?

404
00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.152
He used to say it's
what made us so smart.

405
00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.751
We used to have
so much fun together.

406
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.514
Catching bugs in the backyard.

407
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.560
looking at constellations
through a telescope we built.

408
00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.200
He taught me so much
about science and life.

409
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.157
Maybe he still has something
left to teach you.

410
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.678
- What is it?
- It's a letter from my dad.

411
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.314
Saying...

412
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.754
goodbye.

413
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.280
It's a suicide note.

414
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.989
Alcohol. thank you
very much. <i>Merci.</i>

415
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.914
- There he is.
- Hey.

416
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.593
Dad. we're all set
to celebrate...

417
00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.034
No. hey. um.

418
00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.316
Actually. Hersch isn't Cicada.

419
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.309
<i>What?</i>

420
00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.629
He has to be.

421
00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.189
No. I checked Cicada's
boot print from

422
00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.237
both the Block and Gridlock
crime scenes

423
00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.039
and it's three sizes larger
than Hersch's.

424
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.120
It's not him.

425
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.793
Well. of course it's him.

426
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.593
It's always Hersch.

427
00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.115
Every time I capture Cicada
it's always the same man.

428
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.112
Wait a minute.
you've caught this guy before?

429
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.715
37 times.
I've captured 37 Cicadas.

430
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.200
37 different Earths.

431
00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.919
and every time I try
to capture him.

432
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.754
the trail always leads back
to that Earth's David Hersch.

433
00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.675
So this psychological profile
that you created.

434
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.434
you just made it up?

435
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.193
Not the first time.

436
00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.552
Now the next 36.
then I just trot it out there.

437
00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.880
You know.
to impress the client.

438
00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.639
and then...
Skip to the end.

439
00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.640
And here I thought you were just
a bad detective.

440
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.279
but you're not a bad detective.

441
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.953
You're just a lazy one.

442
00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.720
I'm not lazy.

443
00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.154
I'm efficient. right?

444
00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.959
- Anyway. that's not the point!
- Ow!

445
00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.635
The point's simply
that there's no reason

446
00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.110
for the Cicada of this Earth
to be anyone other

447
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.032
than David Hersch.

448
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.635
Well.
there may be one reason.

449
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.675
What's that?

450
00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.160
The timeline.

451
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.152
Yes. since Nora got here

452
00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.630
things have changed a bit.

453
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.949
Yeah.

454
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.997
Oh. <i>mais non.</i> you must...

455
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.753
how can you not tell me this?

456
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.320
How am I expected to operate

457
00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.000
when you don't give me
all the variables?

458
00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.719
I don't know.
but what we can expect

459
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.519
is a refund. so...

460
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.273
Yeah.

461
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.319
Oh. no. no. no.
That money is long gone.

462
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.616
What do you mean "it's gone"?

463
00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.552
You spent all that money
in one day?

464
00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.960
- Right.
- On what?

465
00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.440
My ex-wife-ves..

466
00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:38.160
Ex-wives.
Seven marriages.

467
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.913
Five wives.
Lots of alimony.

468
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.753
That's not the point!
The point is simply

469
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.832
this is not my fault.

470
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.400
It's your fault.
She is to blame.

471
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.517
Timeline variance.

472
00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.717
Dad.

473
00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.056
You're not gonna
let Hersch off the hook

474
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.719
because of a boot print.

475
00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.553
<i>He's a meta.</i>

476
00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.518
How do we know
what this guy can do?

477
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.353
That's the other thing.

478
00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.736
Hersch has
no dark matter readings.

479
00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.989
He's not a meta.

480
00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.992
All right. remember.
From one CSI to another.

481
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.640
we have to look at the facts.
right?

482
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.120
We got the wrong guy.

483
00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.476
No. not this time.
You know what we should do?

484
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.176
We should throw him in
the pipeline for safe keeping

485
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.431
until he talks.
I'm gonna go get him.

486
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.159
Hey. what are you...
no. you're not.

487
00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.074
We're not gonna kidnap
a suspect in police custody.

488
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.496
If you don't see
what's wrong with that.

489
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.239
you can sit this one out.

490
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.119
Well.
guess we're back to square one

491
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.192
with Cicada.

492
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.350
<i>Yeah.</i>

493
00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.759
Let's hope it's not too late
to save his next victim.

494
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.435
You have a lovely family.
Detective West.

495
00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.830
By not giving me what I want.

496
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.230
by putting your life in danger.

497
00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.757
you're gambling
their future with you.

498
00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.560
If you knew what I know.

499
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.472
you'd cherish them more.

500
00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.677
I'm not luring Vibe
into a death trap.

501
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.792
You can threaten me
all you want.

502
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.950
I'm not afraid.

503
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.319
I believe you.

504
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.120
But you should be.

505
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.396
Still swirling
around up there?

506
00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.196
I just don't get Nora.

507
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.317
I mean. I thought our training
was sinking in.

508
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.869
She defeated Block.
She was really making progress.

509
00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.236
And next thing I know.
she wants to break into CCPD

510
00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.960
and kidnap a suspect
in police custody.

511
00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.077
I mean. it's like she wants to

512
00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.800
make Hersch Cicada.

513
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.432
Barry. you really don't get
why she's obsessed?

514
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.592
- Wait. Should I?
- Think about it.

515
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.478
She's been hearing about
the ripple effects

516
00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.472
on the timeline
since she got here

517
00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.075
and at first they were
relatively small.

518
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.594
but now...

519
00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.797
- Cicada and...
- It's not so small.

520
00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.111
He's one of the worst
serial killers in history.

521
00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.795
and now because of Nora...

522
00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.872
he's here early.

523
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.798
And an entirely different
person.

524
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.678
With an entirely different
set of victims.

525
00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.752
That is a huge weight
to bear for someone

526
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.236
who just wanted to spend time
with a dad she never knew.

527
00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.830
She feels really guilty. Barry.

528
00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.754
She wants to try
to fix her mistakes.

529
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.400
whatever that takes.

530
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.040
Sounds like another speedster
I know. actually.

531
00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.191
Nora says there's an emergency
in the pipeline intake.

532
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.439
Are you sure that...

533
00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.954
Sherloque.

534
00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.032
Yeah.
What happened?

535
00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.471
As far as I can tell
it looks like

536
00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.630
he was in the wrong place

537
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.598
when this fusion cell
went critical.

538
00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.400
I think it wasn't placed
in its cradle properly.

539
00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:08.030
- Vaporized into ash.
- What a way to go.

540
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.793
- Shenanigans.
- Good grife!

541
00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.758
I call shenanigans.

542
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.116
You see.
these cells right here.

543
00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.669
they run in a redundant
cascade circuit.

544
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.114
That's how they power
the pipeline

545
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.795
in the first place.
so if one of them blew

546
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.599
they all would have blown.

547
00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.751
Yeah. the whole pipeline
would have exploded.

548
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.514
Exactly right.

549
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.159
- Ugh.
- Mm.

550
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.756
Darjeeling. oolong.

551
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.513
Tea leaves.

552
00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.160
Barry. be a dear
and check the building

553
00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.118
for a weasel in a pork pie hat.

554
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.920
about yay tall.
smells vaguely of poutine.

555
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.472
Whoa. Tell me...

556
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.756
who died?

557
00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.718
Found him with this.

558
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.800
Of course you did.

559
00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.280
So you thought you could
just leave

560
00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.238
to another Earth
without paying us back?

561
00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.835
Worked on my fourth wife...

562
00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.991
and my sixth.

563
00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.753
- Same woman.
- Oh.

564
00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:06.910
Okay. Cisco.

565
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.753
<i>maybe it's time to have a talk</i>

566
00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.752
about a little place called
debtor's prison.

567
00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.479
Come with me.

568
00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.791
All right.
You make me miss Herr Wells.

569
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.916
Come with me.

570
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.151
I'm... I'm taking you!

571
00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.913
You okay?

572
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.071
Yeah. yeah.
It's just...

573
00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.516
for second I thought me
inviting Sherloque here

574
00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.672
got him killed.
and I just. um...

575
00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.070
at least that's one thing
that's not my fault.

576
00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.519
Hey. I wanted
to talk to you actually.

577
00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.839
I think I understand
how you're feeling.

578
00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.397
Sometimes our powers are
so extraordinary

579
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.911
it makes our mistakes
feel amplified.

580
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.275
especially guilt.

581
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.357
Yeah.
but I should feel guilty.

582
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.632
I've never messed up
this badly before.

583
00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.518
and I can't stop thinking
about it.

584
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.432
That's just 'cause you care.

585
00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.318
<i>It's okay.
It's a good thing.</i>

586
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.959
But...

587
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.199
Nora. if every time
you make a mistake

588
00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.760
you just rush in to fix it

589
00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.071
you're only gonna
make things worse.

590
00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.629
Trust me.
I know that better than anyone.

591
00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.040
You just gotta have
a little more patience.

592
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.157
Take a moment.

593
00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.596
Think before you act.

594
00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.240
Fix the problem the right way.
all right?

595
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.232
Okay.

596
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.038
<i>Listen. Caitlin. I'm sorry.</i>

597
00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.120
For what?

598
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.398
For all of this.

599
00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.631
Just I-I felt like
a complete joke

600
00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.679
after that hostage thing.
and then... Sherloque shows up

601
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.160
and everybody swoons

602
00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.119
over his so-called
"Master Detective-ness."

603
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.396
You were nice enough
to invite me along.

604
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.915
and I pushed you...

605
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.038
into that. and...

606
00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.474
I'm really sorry.

607
00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.313
Ralph. this thing
you pushed me into

608
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.631
gave me something
I've never had before.

609
00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.915
Your first felony?

610
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.231
No.
Closure.

611
00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.832
It may not be pretty.
but I finally know the truth.

612
00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.480
and that means everything.

613
00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.233
So. for my book.

614
00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.920
you're the best detective
a girl could ask for.

615
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.920
Hey. you never told me
what the code was

616
00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.395
on your mom's Resident Evil
laser grid of death.

617
00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.836
It was my birthday.

618
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:54.190
All this
and not even a scream.

619
00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.000
You've experienced pain before.

620
00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:00.232
but not more than me.

621
00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.632
<i>No. Cecile. don't.</i>

622
00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.712
<i>No.
That's what he wants.</i>

623
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.156
I didn't want to do this.

624
00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.119
Not to a family man.

625
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.510
But I will.

626
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.037
Time to make a decision.
Detective West.

627
00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.032
While there's still
some of you left.

628
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.955
No. no. no!

629
00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.913
What's wrong?

630
00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.274
He took Cisco!

631
00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.576
- Cicada took Cisco.
- What do you mean took him?

632
00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:07.856
- Took him where?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

633
00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.656
They jumped into a breach right
when I got here.

634
00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.160
But a breach
could take them anywhere.

635
00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.800
Cisco. can you hear me?

636
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.440
Guys. can you hear me?

637
00:29:17.521 --> 00:29:19.193
Cisco. where are you?

638
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.389
I don't know.
My breach fritzed out

639
00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.994
and spat us out in
a forest somewhere.

640
00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.276
Can you breach out?

641
00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.080
It's not working.

642
00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.554
Cicada's dampening
his powers.

643
00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.336
Without a satellite
I can't pinpoint his location.

644
00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.635
I mean. in this state alone

645
00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.399
there's over
14 million acres of forest.

646
00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.976
All right. Black Forest
and Roanoke are closest.

647
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.400
I'll start there.

648
00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.278
We're not gonna find him
in time. are we?

649
00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.591
<i>Well. before you give up.</i>

650
00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.160
- what kind of trees?
- What?

651
00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.914
In the forest.
what kind of trees. ask him.

652
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.595
Cisco.
what kind of trees are they?

653
00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.149
I don't know!
I'm in a forest!

654
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.111
<i>What kind of trees.
little one?</i>

655
00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.118
<i>- Pine trees. I think.</i>
- Good.

656
00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.277
Some of them have
pointy leaves.

657
00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.079
Ah. pointy...

658
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.958
ash trees. of course.

659
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.470
<i>All right. now I need
you to hold your breath.</i>

660
00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.358
What? Why?

661
00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.794
<i>Because I need
to hear the forest.</i>

662
00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.832
So. shh.

663
00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.234
Crickets.

664
00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.676
You hear this?
Assuming that's field crickets.

665
00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.638
They live in the soil.
Anyway. cross-reference

666
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.712
field crickets
with a high concentration

667
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.280
of pine trees. ash trees.

668
00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.999
in an open field.
and you have...

669
00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.640
- Kolins Woods.
<i>- On my way!</i>

670
00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.118
<i>Barry.
you got to get out of there!</i>

671
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.077
<i>I have to help him.</i>

672
00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.038
Barry?

673
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.437
<i>It takes time
to hone your skills. Nora.</i>

674
00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.512
<i>You can'tjust skip rungs
on the ladder</i>

675
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.760
<i>orjump right
to the big stuff.</i>

676
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.075
<i>that's not how it works.</i>

677
00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.278
<i>Take a moment.
Think before you act.</i>

678
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.955
<i>Fix the problem the right way.</i>

679
00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.993
I got it.

680
00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.116
I can fix this.

681
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.793
I've thought this through.

682
00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.195
I won't mess it up this time.

683
00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.794
I promise.

684
00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.037
I trust you.

685
00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.349
Go.

686
00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.633
All these years
in Central City

687
00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.952
spent defending metas
instead of ending them.

688
00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:04.192
Those days end now.

689
00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.556
Starting with you.

690
00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.399
Use this!

691
00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.751
Hey. Michael Myers.

692
00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.718
dampen this.

693
00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.552
No. No. No. No.

694
00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.478
<i>Cisco's gone.</i>

695
00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.960
Oh. my God...

696
00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.079
Cisco?

697
00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.194
He's alive.

698
00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.112
<i>He's alive.</i>

699
00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:58.876
Hey. man.

700
00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:01.915
Sorry.

701
00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.110
Your daughter.

702
00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.237
She remembered there's more
than one way to

703
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.391
open a breach.

704
00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.709
Figured Cicada
wouldn't give up

705
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:14.995
until Vibe was dead.

706
00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.914
so we gave him what he wanted.

707
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.912
Thanks. fangirl.

708
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.469
You saved my life.

709
00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.153
I did good?

710
00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.754
You did great.

711
00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.560
It's almost like
you're really dead.

712
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.552
Yeah.

713
00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.990
I almost really was.

714
00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.960
How the hell are
we gonna catch this guy?

715
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.196
Not with our powers.
We know that at least.

716
00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.634
We don't know
much else either.

717
00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:53.519
Variations in the timeline.
they've...

718
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.512
shifted the elements.
complicated the equation.

719
00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.273
- Now...
- Not all those elements

720
00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.874
are bad though.

721
00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.616
You could be the new element
that saves us.

722
00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.200
You could be the reason
we catch Cicada.

723
00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.590
I must admit.
Miss Nora here pulled

724
00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.273
the rug right under
from Cicada.

725
00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.919
Oof. <i>allez hop.</i> huh?

726
00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.713
Very impressive.
Yeah. that's the only

727
00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.096
fake death we're gonna see
around here

728
00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.395
'cause you're sticking around

729
00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.880
until you pay us back
every cent.

730
00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.336
<i>Well. I have to say.
the prospect</i>

731
00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.794
of another mystery with Cicada

732
00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.234
puts a little pep in my step.

733
00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.959
Also. that breach device
you use to get

734
00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.269
in and out of places.
I suppose

735
00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.794
that's under lock and key
right now?

736
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.096
That's at the bottom
of the ocean

737
00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.349
as far as you're concerned.

738
00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.590
Well. then I'm staying!

739
00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:27.816
<i>- Great!
- Course you are.</i>

740
00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.115
I'm watching you. Holmes.

741
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.336
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Well. you'll learn a lot.

742
00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.635
- Good for you.
- Ow.

743
00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.915
All right. shall we.
sidekick.

744
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.200
I'll sidekick your face.

745
00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.880
Something tells me
those two are gonna be

746
00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.520
just great friends.

747
00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.512
So...

748
00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.479
You guys up for
a family dinner night?

749
00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.714
Sure.

750
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.634
Yeah.
And then maybe after

751
00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.235
we could help you
move into the loft.

752
00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.936
I know you've been kind of
cooped up here.

753
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.555
and now that Sherloque
is gonna need a place to stay

754
00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.075
I thought you could...

755
00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.959
crash with us.

756
00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.680
I think it's a great idea.
Nora.

757
00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.315
Okay. thanks. yeah.
Thanks.

758
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.474
Let me get my purse.

759
00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.313
- Okay.
- This will be good.

760
00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.760
I think it could be
just the thing

761
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.678
to bring you two closer
together.

762
00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.038
I really hope so.

763
00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.154
Hey.

764
00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.594
Taking Cisco out
for some drinks

765
00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.160
in memoriam of Vibe.

766
00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.835
- You wanna come?
- I'm okay. but thank you.

767
00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.673
Anything you want
to talk about?

768
00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.912
My dad wasn't really
the letter writing type.

769
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.176
I feel like he would have found
some other way to tell me.

770
00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.296
No luck with his work notes?

771
00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.913
No. I mean.
these molecular models

772
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.639
are gibberish.
There's gaps everywhere

773
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.440
and some of these compounds
don't even exist.

774
00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.159
It's like his mind
was the first to go.

775
00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.640
But. maybe I should
just listen to my mom

776
00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.712
and forget about the past.

777
00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.040
Well...

778
00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.793
You left this behind.

779
00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:14.039
Sometimes the past
is worth remembering.

780
00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.118
Thank you.

781
00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:33.949
<i>They don't exist</i>

782
00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.111
because they're not
supposed to.

783
00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.313
So this is all
I could remember

784
00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.993
about Cicada.
It's not much. but...

785
00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.520
No. No. No. this is...
this is great.

786
00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.800
I mean.
every little bit we get

787
00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.274
helps build a profile on him.

788
00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.556
I will comb over this
in the morning.

789
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.200
You should go be
with Cecile right now.

790
00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.634
Feel better.

791
00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.589
Wait. There's...
there's one more thing.

792
00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.115
He made these comments

793
00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.350
about family

794
00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.999
and cherishing them.

795
00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.640
<i>And then the way he picked up
Jenna's blanket.</i>

796
00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.355
and I got this feeling

797
00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.750
when I looked in his eyes.

798
00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.832
What... what kind of feeling?

799
00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:58.038
I think Cicada's a father.

800
00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.153
Hello. Orlin.

801
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.513
Any progress?

802
00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.712
She's not coming out of it.

803
00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.672
Let me see it.

804
00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.314
It's not healing.

805
00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:56.756
Doesn't matter.

806
00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.718
You can't keep doing this.

807
00:39:58.800 --> 00:39:59.836
You have to stop.

808
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.832
Not until I'm finished.

809
00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.473
Oh. hi.

810
00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.880
I'm just looking for my purse.

811
00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.952
I'm about to have dinner
with my parents.

812
00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.309
It's on the chair.

813
00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:41.516
In the Cortex.

814
00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.478
By the mannequin.

815
00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:45.552
Right.
Thanks.

816
00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.393
Well. enjoy the couch.

817
00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:48.675
Nora.

818
00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:53.070
Can you help me with something?

819
00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.958
I've been wondering...

820
00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.157
You. You've traveled back
into all these

821
00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.436
great moments of your parent's
lives. right?

822
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.359
Some wonderful. some dangerous.

823
00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.870
Most not as dangerous as...

824
00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.270
punching a falling satellite.
right?

825
00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.629
And yet...

826
00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.076
that is the moment
when you made

827
00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.880
the decision to act.

828
00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.077
altering the course
of history forever.

829
00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.112
That decision...

830
00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.913
did you come to it on your own?

831
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.953
Of course you did!

832
00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.872
Right?
No. of course you did.

833
00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.110
You're XS!

834
00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.237
The temptation...

835
00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.152
was too much. I'm sure.

836
00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.720
It was.

837
00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.918
Well. please.

838
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.832
forgive me.
You have a dinner to go to.

839
00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:45.354
Good night.

840
00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.594
<i>Greg. move your head.</i>
