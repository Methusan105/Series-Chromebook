<i>My name is Barry Allen.</i>

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.077
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.196
<i>To the outside world.</i>

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.590
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist.</i>

5
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.320
<i>but secretly. with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs.</i>

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.154
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

7
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.550
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help.</i>

8
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.871
<i>she changed the present.</i>

9
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.475
<i>and now our world is
more dangerous than ever.</i>

10
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.870
<i>and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.277
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

12
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.000
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

13
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.515
Let's dance. crickets-y.

14
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.034
How can she still come out?

15
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.237
I guess she's immune
to Cicada's dagger?

16
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.357
The shards
weren't dampening my powers.

17
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.874
They were removing them.

18
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.077
We could make
a meta-human cure.

19
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.000
- What this is?
- What is that. Nora's journal?

20
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.440
Have you seen
this code before?

21
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.296
<i>Yeah. right after Barry
came out of the Speed Force.</i>

22
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.776
- It's a time language.
- Time language?

23
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.376
Where does one learn
something like that?

24
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.518
<i>- I created it. actually.</i>
- Clever girl.

25
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.954
My God. Orlin.

26
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.111
You scared
the living daylights out of me.

27
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.078
Did anyone follow you?

28
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.117
Of course not.

29
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.112
It's been weeks since
you fought the Flash

30
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.000
at the hospital.
If anyone knew you were here.

31
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.833
you would have
found out by now.

32
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.877
I got you some groceries

33
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.191
and some Meloxicam
for your injuries.

34
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.034
I don't need it.

35
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.919
Good to hear.

36
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.993
- How's Grace?
- Nothing's changed.

37
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.073
She's stable.
CCPD hasn't left

38
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.157
and they're not leaving
any time soon.

39
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.800
- Well. I need to see her. Doc.
- That's not possible.

40
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.318
Don't tell me
what's possible.

41
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.598
You're angry.
Good.

42
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.056
<i>For all the pain
your family has suffered</i>

43
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.833
<i>at the hands of those metas.
you should be.</i>

44
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.833
But right now there isn't
anything you can do for Grace.

45
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.311
so put that anger
towards something else.

46
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.456
I have a friend
who feels the same way

47
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.834
about meta-humans
as we do.

48
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.159
<i>and he wants to help you finish
what you've started.</i>

49
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.477
<i>Orlin?</i>

50
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.237
It's time to get back to work.

51
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.876
This is it.
The only thing between us

52
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.317
and our big score is one
reinforced concrete wall.

53
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.313
- Don't hurt yourself. Bork.
- Can't hurt Bork.

54
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.720
But Bork can hurt you.

55
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.474
Hyah!

56
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.795
That should do it.

57
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.232
The hell?

58
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.673
Hyah!

59
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.711
Ah!

60
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.797
You're one. too.

61
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.960
Ah!

62
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.551
Ah!

63
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.116
I don't know what's crazier.
how big this guy is

64
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.032
or the number
of incised wounds on his body.

65
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.976
Well. and the depressed skull
fracture points to impact

66
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.834
with hardened surface.
but cause of death

67
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.639
is definitely
repeated stabbings.

68
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.394
Yeah. looks like
someone was really angry.

69
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.278
Look at these wounds.

70
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.576
Doesn't it look like they have
the same depth and diameter

71
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.840
as the ones on Gridlock's body?

72
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.991
Yeah. and like Block's
and Raelene Sharp's.

73
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.675
Yeah.

74
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.720
<i>Iris just got a tip.</i>

75
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.639
Another meta-human was murdered
in her apartment. same C.O.D.

76
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.151
- Dad. these aren't one-offs.
- No.

77
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.959
Cicada's back
and he's on a killing spree.

78
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.056
Okay. well. there's got to be
a lead in one of these attacks

79
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.160
that can help us track him.
We'll get the team on it.

80
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.479
<i>Killer Frost. seriously?</i>

81
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.914
I can't take it anymore.

82
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.834
Uh. Caitlin.
is everything... oh.

83
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.037
Alter-ego confab.

84
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.077
Seen enough episodes
of <i>Sister. Sister</i>

85
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.880
to recognize a sibling spat
when I see one.

86
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.276
Oh. So.
I'm trying to help Cisco

87
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.953
with his meta-human cure.

88
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.520
but every time
I start working on it.

89
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.678
Killer Frost takes over
and messes with my equations.

90
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.160
Like this.

91
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.630
She changed all my
heterozygotes into asterisks.

92
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.633
Oh. I thought those
were just tiny snowflakes.

93
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.596
So she's not on board?

94
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.519
No. and I don't
exactly know why.

95
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.200
- Can't you just ask her?
- Oh. I've tried.

96
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.880
But every time we
start talking about it.

97
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.395
she starts singing
Barney's "I Love You" song.

98
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.557
- Ooh. that's cold.
- Yeah.

99
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.200
What about Cisco?
Is he having any luck?

100
00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.240
Not yet.

101
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.760
He went to
the Tannhauser off-site

102
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.275
so he could concentrate.
He says it's quiet there.

103
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.670
Yeah.
Quiet like a tomb.

104
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.432
So I think if I can isolate
the genetic marker

105
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.273
that bonds human DNA
to dark matter.

106
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.079
I can reverse engineer
the process

107
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.117
and unravel it
to create a cure.

108
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.318
- That's great.
- Yeah. except I need meta-DNA

109
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.631
that hasn't fully bonded
with dark matter yet.

110
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.791
Of course.
because as we all know

111
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.032
with genetic modification we...
Why?

112
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.032
Because that's the only time
when I can identify

113
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.176
where the marker
is in the genome.

114
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.680
Okay. so you need DNA

115
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.558
from a meta-human
who was created recently?

116
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.109
Yeah. ideally
in the last eight months.

117
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.318
but everyone I can think of
has been killed by Cicada.

118
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.272
Right.

119
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.312
So where the heck do we look?

120
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.352
<i>The lone decrypted entry</i>

121
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.433
from the journal
of Nora West Allen:

122
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.638
"The timeline is malleable."

123
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.280
Why that's the only one
that translated?

124
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.595
And why is she interested
in the timeline.

125
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.512
and maybe more important.

126
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.751
why is she hiding
this interest?

127
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.157
<i>Sherloque.
we need you in the cortex.</i>

128
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.993
But of course.

129
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.390
Kira May.
Dwayne Geist. Carl Bork.

130
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.955
All three metas who were killed
by Cicada last night.

131
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.713
So Cicada's killed
almost as many people

132
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.440
in the last 12 hours as he has
in the last eight months?

133
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.456
And it doesn't look like
he's slowing down anytime soon.

134
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.600
Well. we need to stop him
before he hurts anyone else.

135
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.616
Sherloque. do you have any
ideas on what to do about that?

136
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.996
Not at the moment. but any
time I run into a road block

137
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.878
in an investigation.
I do what I always do.

138
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.317
I just pursue
a different avenue.

139
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.240
We'll find him.
Something will bring him to us.

140
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.953
Something like...

141
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.536
Satellites picking up
dark matter flare.

142
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.552
- It's him.
- Something like that.

143
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.696
Suit up.
We don't have a lot of time.

144
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.316
Not without precautions.
For Killer Frost.

145
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.598
She doesn't need a weapon.
Killer Frost is the weapon.

146
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.198
Powers or no powers.
I will mess you up.

147
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.437
Ah!

148
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.874
Negate this!

149
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.834
Hold on.
Help!

150
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.673
We need Caitlin.

151
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.440
We need to get her
to a hospital.

152
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.153
Here. come with me.

153
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.279
Oh. God.

154
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.191
Ah!

155
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.517
Aah!

156
00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.075
No!

157
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.913
Aah!

158
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.432
Nora.
Hey. Nora. Nora?

159
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.558
Okay. Nora...
Nora?

160
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.953
Nora?

161
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.960
Well?

162
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.559
Cicada caused
an axial burst fracture

163
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.917
in her L3. L4. and L5
vertebrae.

164
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.430
He also severely displaced

165
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.637
her fourth thoracic vertebrae.

166
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.959
It's not good.

167
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.437
But her speed healing
is going to kick in. right?

168
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.591
Right?

169
00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.191
Cicada's cut flooded
her body with dark matter.

170
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.318
It's affecting her powers.

171
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.471
Her speed healing
should kick in...

172
00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.153
but for now...

173
00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.270
I'll keep monitoring
her progress.

174
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.919
- Barry.
- It's okay. she'll heal.

175
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.435
It'll be all right.

176
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.160
Nora?

177
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.631
Oh. what happened?

178
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.552
Honey. um...

179
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.200
Oh. why does it hurt
to breathe?

180
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.670
It's gonna hurt
for a little bit.

181
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.991
Why?

182
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.875
I can't move my legs.

183
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.590
Um. why can't I move my legs?

184
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.831
- Mom. I can't move my legs.
- Nora.

185
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.912
Mom?
Mom. why can't I move my legs?

186
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.151
Nora. look.

187
00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.596
You can't move
your legs because...

188
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.957
Cicada broke your back.

189
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.637
What?
So I'm paralyzed?

190
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.996
- What. forever?
- No. no. not forever.

191
00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.470
Well. for how long then?

192
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.793
We don't know.

193
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.999
Mom...

194
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.039
Hey. I got here
as fast as I could.

195
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.190
Joe's still in Tibet.

196
00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.919
I left him a message
to get back ASAP.

197
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.037
Hey. it's all right.
He should stay with Wally.

198
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.190
- Oh. my God.
- Hey.

199
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.953
Hi.

200
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.679
- How is she?
- It's not good.

201
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.636
I'm so sorry. Barry.

202
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.632
Hey. I don't care
how we do it.

203
00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.996
- We need to stop Dwyer now.
- Well. I agree.

204
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.336
All right. well.
I'm gonna call Cisco.

205
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.320
- We should get him back here.
- No. no. no. he...

206
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.357
he should finish the cure
he's working on.

207
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.656
His time is better spent there.

208
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.114
- Sherloque.
<i>- Oui?</i>

209
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.590
Earn your money.
How do we track this guy?

210
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.216
Well. I think the first thing
we should do

211
00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.357
is concentrate on the victims.
Look for a connection.

212
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.955
Take a look here for example.
This man. Geist.

213
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.793
has a spider tattoo
on his neck.

214
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.270
generally indicating he was
caught in some form of web.

215
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.115
What kind of web?
A prison web. perhaps.

216
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.556
- And Kira May...
- She was wearing clothes.

217
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.976
Of course she was
wearing clothes. Giraffe.

218
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.216
No. she was wearing clothes
that are two sizes too large.

219
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.391
- Two sizes too large.
- Recent rapid weight loss.

220
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.296
It's a common side effect
of solitary confinement.

221
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.800
- Right.
- And Carl Borg...

222
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.336
<i>And Carl Borg.
this report says</i>

223
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.360
<i>he had a droopy eyelid.</i>

224
00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.874
<i>which is nerve paralysis.</i>

225
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.634
common side effect
of consuming too much borat.

226
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.280
Or as it's known
on this earth. bruno.

227
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.696
More commonly known
as prison wine.

228
00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.756
Prison wine.

229
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.016
All three of these meta-humans

230
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.316
were former criminals.

231
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.720
Look at this.

232
00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.752
It's a meta-human
arrest log from 2018.

233
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.160
Look at the first three names.

234
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.674
<i>These were his victims.</i>

235
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.280
He's killing
in the order of this list.

236
00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.376
<i>This list has addresses.
employment information.</i>

237
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.596
It's got license plate numbers.
This is everything

238
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.194
Cicada needs to find them.

239
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.078
Where would he even get this?

240
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.719
I think there's only
one place. right?

241
00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.351
<i>There's a killer
still at large in our city.</i>

242
00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.512
People are afraid of being
out in the streets.

243
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.876
I'm getting 100 phone calls
a day about this guy.

244
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.599
I want neighborhoods
re-canvassed.

245
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.320
I want evidence re-examined.
Jonesy!

246
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.995
Take your unit and paper
the city with Dwyer's photo.

247
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.437
I want this guy.
Let's go get him!

248
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.674
Allen?

249
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.951
We need to talk...
in private.

250
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.360
All right.

251
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.960
What the hell is this?

252
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.158
That's how Dwyer's
getting his victims.

253
00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.074
This is from our database
of meta-humans?

254
00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.958
Well. it doesn't prove
he got it from CCPD.

255
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.715
Doesn't it?

256
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.096
<i>He could have broken
into another precinct</i>

257
00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.430
or hacked into
the CCPD database.

258
00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.398
David Dwyer is a machinist.
He's not a hacker.

259
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.312
Somebody gave this to him.
Somebody here!

260
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.776
Okay. Barry.
maybe we should go ahead

261
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.191
and let Captain Singh
look into this on his own.

262
00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.393
Yeah.
I think that's a good idea.

263
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.080
Thank you. David.

264
00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.117
<i>Hey. Barry. Barry.</i>

265
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.310
Barry. where are you going?

266
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.754
I don't know. Cecile.

267
00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.274
but I gotta do something

268
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.016
before Dwyer kills
all the people on that list.

269
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.633
Hey.

270
00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.035
What if we use it. too?

271
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.433
- What?
- The list.

272
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.336
Three years ago. Joe asked me
to help get meta-humans

273
00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.714
transferred out of the city.

274
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.678
Yeah. I remember.
You told him not to do it.

275
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.958
Yeah. well. that was before
I knew what I know now.

276
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.032
Besides. those metas
were active prisoners.

277
00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.391
These metas. they've already
served their time.

278
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.336
Look. even if we got 'em out
of town. it wouldn't matter.

279
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.976
Cicada's gonna
track them down eventually.

280
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.753
They need new names.
new identities.

281
00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.176
We don't have the resources
to do that.

282
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.078
No. we do not.

283
00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.833
But the Feds do.

284
00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.056
They give
this kind of protection

285
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.514
to regular humans all the time.

286
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.016
It is about time
they start offering it

287
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.679
to meta-humans. too.

288
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.355
I am going to go call in every
favor I have ever banked

289
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.113
and I am going to make
this thing happen.

290
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.160
and in the meantime. you need
to go get them somewhere safe.

291
00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.232
- All right.
- Okay.

292
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.840
So. can you try
wiggling your toes?

293
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.640
I can't.

294
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.349
Again?

295
00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.194
I can't.

296
00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.712
- Anything?
- I don't feel anything.

297
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.912
Okay. well. Cicada's dark
matter has left your system.

298
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.071
so you should be
healing soon.

299
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.152
I mean. since my last scan.
your spinal axons

300
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.469
have grown five millimeters.

301
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.233
That's something. right?

302
00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.879
It's progress.

303
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.720
Maybe not quite the speed
we were hoping for.

304
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.632
but it's something.

305
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.877
I'm going to go run
a few more tests.

306
00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.071
Hey.

307
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.669
Don't give up. okay?

308
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.638
Growth is growth.

309
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.637
Normal axon growth rate
reaches five millimeters

310
00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.872
a day in a large nerve.

311
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.032
With speed healing.
mine should be over 100.

312
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.316
How do you know that?

313
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.153
I took neuro-regeneration

314
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.835
in my fifth grade STEM class.

315
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.274
I took fractions
in fifth grade.

316
00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.354
What if I don't heal. Mom?
What if I never get better?

317
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.351
Can I just be left alone
for a little bit. please?

318
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.996
Yeah.
Okay.

319
00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.714
I respect your right
to protest the cure. Frosty.

320
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.077
but even for me.
that is excessive.

321
00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.720
Well. maybe Caitlin
will get the hint now.

322
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.393
Uh...

323
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.917
Snow and Frost are having
creative differences.

324
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.275
I'll get Caitlin.

325
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.354
No. I-I need you. actually.

326
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.240
We need to get all those metas
to a safe house

327
00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.640
before Cicada finds them.

328
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.679
Oh. and you think
they're going to listen to me?

329
00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.080
50-50 on that.

330
00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.800
I haven't quite lived up
to my name.

331
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.231
But I do know where
we should start.

332
00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.960
Doesn't look like
anyone's been here in months.

333
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.191
Maybe the rumors about
Amunet skipping town are true.

334
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.318
We're not here for Amunet.
We're here for her pet snake.

335
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.198
And the thing about snakes is.

336
00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.193
they're always lurking
in some dark corner.

337
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.960
Hello. Norvock.

338
00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.078
Frost. thank God it's you.

339
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.720
Those are Cicada's targets.
but we need your help

340
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.576
rounding everyone up
so we can get them to safety.

341
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.576
Because they're not going
to trust a bunch of masks?

342
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.513
They will if you tell them
it's for their own good.

343
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.512
Some of these guys
are bad news.

344
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.831
- You sure they're worth saving?
- Are you?

345
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.798
<i>Cicada's not going to stop
until every meta</i>

346
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.031
in this city is dead.
Is that how you want to end up?

347
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.439
Damn.
What did he do to you?

348
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.416
<i>We've arranged
for everyone to enter</i>

349
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.760
a witness protection
program.

350
00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.936
Federal agents will lead you

351
00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.838
out of the city
to safety tonight.

352
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.000
All right.

353
00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:41.470
I'm in. but only if I'm the
first one on that transport.

354
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.517
Nice of you to look out
for your fellow metas.

355
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.432
I look out for me
and me alone.

356
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.954
Then let's get
to rounding up.

357
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.633
Yup.

358
00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.431
<i>- David.</i>
- If this is about that list...

359
00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.751
It is.
but it's not what you think.

360
00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.355
I need your help.

361
00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.033
With what?

362
00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.396
I'm having those metas
moved to federal protection.

363
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.075
- which is where you come in.
- What do you need?

364
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.279
Road blocks. tonight.
from Linsin to Webber Avenue.

365
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.995
I know. David. I know.
but I can't risk

366
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.073
any incoming traffic
during the scheduled transfer.

367
00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.310
I'll make it happen.

368
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.357
Thank you.

369
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.751
Officer Jones.

370
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.674
- You all right?
- Never better.

371
00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.438
I'm tired of waiting.

372
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.516
<i>This Cicada.
he wants to kill us?</i>

373
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.034
I say we kill him first.

374
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.909
You can't.
We're your only chance.

375
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.151
- So you keep saying.
- Look. if you're too dumb

376
00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.316
to recognize the truth.

377
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.119
then you can go.
but you're on your own.

378
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.039
I'm not going to watch anybody
else be broken by this maniac.

379
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.039
He's telling the truth.

380
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.232
I saw Cicada kill Carl Bork.

381
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.515
Bork's dead?

382
00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.079
His dagger
took away our powers.

383
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.597
I ran. Bork fought.

384
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.110
That's why I'm here
and he's not.

385
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.352
So. yeah. leave if you want.

386
00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.716
but I'm gonna listen
to these guys

387
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.353
and stay alive.

388
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.235
That was quite
the speech back there.

389
00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.959
Almost seemed like
you actually wanted

390
00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.400
to save those meta-humans.

391
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.234
No. you know me
better than that.

392
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.755
No. I don't think I do.

393
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.150
I used to be a good guy.
you know?

394
00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.632
I worked at the Central City
Zoo. watching the reptile cage.

395
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.390
We were open the night the
particle accelerator blew up.

396
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.880
After the blast
shattered all the cages.

397
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.840
I had to pull
an elapid snake off a kid.

398
00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.515
Then that dark matter hit.

399
00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.920
What happened to the kid?

400
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.072
He's fine.

401
00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.392
But what do I get. huh?
A snake in my head?

402
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.234
And a psycho killer
that wants me dead?

403
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:31.712
That was the last time I put
anyone else before myself.

404
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.190
You know. it's almost like
a small part of me feels

405
00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.634
sorry for that guy.

406
00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.189
Why?
He's only out for himself.

407
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.512
Come on.
he's clearly terrified.

408
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.193
I know what that's like.

409
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.680
You're going to tell me

410
00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.514
that you've
never felt fear like that?

411
00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.553
- No. why?
- Really?

412
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.554
Not even a little bit worried
about Caitlin making the cure?

413
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.716
- Is that everyone?
- Everyone except Shawna Baez.

414
00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.311
A meta that calls herself
Peek-A-Boo?

415
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.800
Anyone know where she'll be?

416
00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.951
Try the Sundollar on Eighth.

417
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.914
All right.

418
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.952
Bar's not open yet.
Not even for you. Flash.

419
00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.394
Shawna.

420
00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.834
I need you to come with me.

421
00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.776
I didn't do anything
this time.

422
00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.519
I know.
You're not in trouble.

423
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:45.656
All right.
you're in danger.

424
00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.816
I want to take you
some place safe.

425
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.151
Like your science prison?
Sorry.

426
00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.399
Shawna?
Please.

427
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.312
Somebody is trying to kill you.

428
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.040
Someone's always trying
to kill me.

429
00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.793
See ya around. Flash.

430
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.591
What did you do to me?

431
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.757
Shawna. run.

432
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.190
Who the hell is that?

433
00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.760
Take this.
press the button.

434
00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.593
When a breach opens.
jump into it.

435
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.074
Go!

436
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.360
Hyah!

437
00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.554
Come on. come on...

438
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.119
Make this thing work.

439
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.830
They're all terrified.
I can feel it.

440
00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.071
Maybe now they believe us.

441
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.072
Hey. we're almost
through this.

442
00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.311
We are going to get all
of these people to safety.

443
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.517
Even if we do. Cicada's
not going to stop killing.

444
00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.991
- Not until...
- Until he's dead.

445
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.353
- I didn't say that.
- You didn't have to.

446
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.671
The anger that I feel
from you says it all.

447
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.680
How am I supposed to feel?
He almost killed Nora.

448
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.911
Barry. I understand. I do.

449
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.357
That man hurt your child.

450
00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.472
But this anger
that you're feeling.

451
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.074
I have felt it before...

452
00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.231
from Cicada.

453
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.919
<i>Honey. if you let it.
this rage will consume you.</i>

454
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.356
<i>the same way
it's already consumed him.</i>

455
00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.440
Wait. I have felt this anger
from someone before.

456
00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.232
At CCPD.
Oh. my God. Barry.

457
00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.680
I think I know
who leaked the list.

458
00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.790
Then let's go get him.

459
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.639
No. no. no. you...
you stay here.

460
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.552
You get these metas
to the drop.

461
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.640
I can handle the rest.

462
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.718
Ah. well. look.
Neurological delight.

463
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.359
Why. you'll be back
on these feet

464
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.272
and chasing Cicada
in no time.

465
00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.079
- I hope so.
- Yes. In the meantime.

466
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.554
maybe you can help me
do the same.

467
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.438
Oh. I already told
the team everything I know

468
00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.876
- about the Flash museum.
- Flash museum. right.

469
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.191
Do you think that
I could look at the archives

470
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.350
from that Flash museum?

471
00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.193
After all. I have made a career

472
00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:48.069
out of noticing things
that other people miss.

473
00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.994
Maybe it's not a problem
to bring those archives

474
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.992
for me to look at?

475
00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.719
Yeah. I guess so.

476
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.952
Or maybe it's easier
for me to go there?

477
00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.191
You want me to bring you
to the future?

478
00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.920
Mm.
It's a great suggestion.

479
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.754
<i>Is it even possible
for a non-speedster</i>

480
00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.480
to go into the commodity...
What'd you call it? The. um...

481
00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.758
- The Speed Force?
- Speed Force. Right.

482
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.672
Uh. I'm not sure.

483
00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.752
Mm.
Right.

484
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.877
Well. perhaps that's a question

485
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.679
<i>for someone
with more experience.</i>

486
00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.116
- Sherloque.
- Mm?

487
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.715
Can I talk to you
for a second?

488
00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.555
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

489
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.311
- That's my daughter in there.
- Yes. so?

490
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.296
And I'm going to do whatever
it takes to protect her.

491
00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.279
Even from people
who I thought were her friends.

492
00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.192
So I'm gonna need you
to tell me right now

493
00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.794
why you're
investigating Nora.

494
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.314
Invest... no. no.
<i>Quoi?</i>

495
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.517
No one's investigating Nora.

496
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.952
Quoi?
<i>No one's investigating Nora.</i>

497
00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.793
Maybe I'm investigating
Nora a little bit.

498
00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.239
Why?

499
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.198
You think. what.
Nora is hiding something?

500
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.397
No. um...

501
00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.312
How can I say this?

502
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.278
Sometimes
when you're a detective.

503
00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.670
you see a story
and you follow it.

504
00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.150
And there's different tracks.

505
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.720
You follow down the track.

506
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.951
With Nora.
I am following down this track.

507
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.960
Do you know how many stories
I've chased

508
00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.872
- that went absolutely nowhere?
- Mm.

509
00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.429
So many that I stopped
chasing them for a while

510
00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.233
instead of doing
what I should have done.

511
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.437
something you suggested.
actually.

512
00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.239
which is going down
a different track.

513
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.118
Mm.

514
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.716
That track is the wrong one.

515
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.471
Careful
with your little monocle.

516
00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.314
Learn to take notes
like everyone else.

517
00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.394
Nora!

518
00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.390
Oh. my goodness.

519
00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.358
What do you want. Ralph?

520
00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.856
I know it's none
of my business

521
00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.000
<i>why you're afraid of a cure.</i>

522
00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:09.313
but for what it's worth.
I'm a meta.

523
00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.993
and I'm all for it.

524
00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.120
And after talking with most
of those people out there...

525
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.711
- So are some of them.
- Oh. yeah. I can see that.

526
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.757
I just don't understand why.

527
00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.559
It might save their lives.

528
00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.915
It's not that simple for me.

529
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Why not?

530
00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.635
Because. just like Norvock
didn't ask for his snake.

531
00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.120
Caity didn't ask for me.

532
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.238
So if one day she wakes up
scared of being a meta-human

533
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.551
and decides to take that cure.

534
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.916
her powers don't
just disappear.

535
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.992
I do too.

536
00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.878
<i>That's what
I'm really afraid of.</i>

537
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.189
'Cause if I'm gone
who's going to protect her?

538
00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.755
It's witching hour.

539
00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.872
I get why
you're scared. but...

540
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.994
you need to know that when
DeVoe made you disappear.

541
00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.879
all Caitlin talked about
was getting you back.

542
00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.395
<i>So maybe as much as you want
to protect her.</i>

543
00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.680
Caitlin wants
to protect you. too.

544
00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:22.477
I went after three of them
tonight and they weren't there.

545
00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.029
Did you tip them off?

546
00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.116
No. I swear.

547
00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.998
After what that Spencer woman
did to me

548
00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.039
with her meta-tech.
I want them all gone.

549
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.713
- Then what happened?
- The D.A.

550
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.400
She figured out
you're targeting everyone

551
00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.794
on the list I gave you.

552
00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.439
The contact of mine
with the Feds

553
00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.616
says they're being picked up

554
00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:44.915
and put into
protective custody.

555
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.800
Tonight.

556
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.917
Where?

557
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.191
Boys and girls.
your ride's here.

558
00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.034
What the hell?

559
00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.717
Everybody get back!

560
00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.431
Thank you. Flash.

561
00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.558
for bringing them all to me.

562
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.119
The chopper's
not going to be able to land.

563
00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.476
Take everybody out the back
and get them on it somehow.

564
00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:45.710
Come on.

565
00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.797
No. he's mine.

566
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.996
Hyah!

567
00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.952
All right. we're out
of the dampening field.

568
00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.512
Shawna. can you help?

569
00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.398
Every meta for themselves.

570
00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.552
What now?

571
00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.755
I don't suppose you can
run up my arm. can you?

572
00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.633
Ralph.
what are you planning to do?

573
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.234
Remember. Baby Giraffe.

574
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.073
they took a leap of faith
with you.

575
00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.834
That's why I'm going to take
a leap for them. Shirley.

576
00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.389
All right. everybody.
Straight line. single file.

577
00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.630
tuck your arms in.

578
00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.876
- Keep this thing steady.
- Roger that.

579
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.120
Stand there!

580
00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.351
Tuck your arms.

581
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.549
You can't win this fight.

582
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.552
I bet I can.

583
00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.109
We haven't been
formally introduced.

584
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.716
They call me Killer Frost.
Let me show you why.

585
00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.075
Ah!

586
00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.753
Ugh.

587
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.160
<i>Killer Frost. duck!</i>

588
00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:43.635
- You saved me.
- You saved them first.

589
00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.200
Nice work.

590
00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.670
<i>Let's get out of here for real!</i>

591
00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.917
Give him hell. Flash!

592
00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.993
Okay. you see.
the metas are on the move.

593
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.958
- Bravo.
- Something's wrong with Barry.

594
00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.040
What?

595
00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.635
I've never seen these kind
of readings from Barry's suit.

596
00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.398
He's channeling over 2.86
billion joules of energy.

597
00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.119
That's a combined equivalent

598
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.873
of... of almost
three lightning bolts.

599
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.952
Cicada's powers allow him
to sustain injury

600
00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.838
- but not that much.
- Barry.

601
00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.640
<i>Barry.</i>

602
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.193
He's not going to stop.

603
00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.956
You're never gonna hurt
my daughter again!

604
00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.873
- Aah!
- Dad!

605
00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.755
No.

606
00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.313
Oh. I'm sorry.
I let him get away.

607
00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.715
No. you brought me back.

608
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.833
Alright. the Feds
have processed Norvock

609
00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.196
and the other metas.
giving them new identities.

610
00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.192
so everybody's safe.

611
00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.670
Satellite hasn't registered
any unaccounted-for dark matter

612
00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.400
so. wherever Dwyer is.
his dagger's not in use.

613
00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.558
Psh. after the beating Barry
gave him. ain't no way

614
00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:52.030
he's using that dagger
anytime soon.

615
00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:57.838
What?
He got what he deserved.

616
00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.277
Oh. no. I think
we appreciate your groove.

617
00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:04.990
Also I think that Killer Frost
and the Flash combination is

618
00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.237
enough to maybe have Dwyer
not want to show his face

619
00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.800
<i>around here any time soon.</i>

620
00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.234
Dad. are you okay?

621
00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.549
I'm good.

622
00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.552
What matters
is that you're okay.

623
00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.376
How's it feel
to be up and running again?

624
00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.914
Super frickin' schway.

625
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.435
Uh. wanna know what's
not super frickin' schway?

626
00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.796
Cicada knowing exactly
when and where

627
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.394
our secret transport
was taking place.

628
00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.678
Mm.
Inside job. right?

629
00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:31.640
Cicada clearly has
a inside man. only...

630
00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.996
Only what kind of cop
would help Cicada

631
00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.355
kill innocent people?

632
00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.796
One that's going to have to
answer to D.A. Cecile Horton.

633
00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.597
Captain.
you wanted to see me?

634
00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.717
Come on in.

635
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.154
Officer Jones.

636
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.913
this was printed
off of your hard drive.

637
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.714
Copy of the list of metas
that Cicada's been pursuing.

638
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.315
Funny thing.
it is the same list

639
00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.754
that we know you accessed

640
00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.031
on your home computer
just this week.

641
00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.256
Care to tell me
why you decided

642
00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.953
to aid and abet
a murderer?

643
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.635
No. that's not... you don't
know what you're talking about.

644
00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.279
Really?

645
00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:11.320
A woman used meta-human tech
to take control of your mind.

646
00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.835
She made you do things
that you were certain

647
00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.913
you would never do.

648
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.957
And that frightened you.
didn't it?

649
00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.680
It frightened you
and it made you angry.

650
00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.400
and you went ahead
and you embraced that anger

651
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.836
and you let it
drive your every move.

652
00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:30.436
Betrayal.
Revenge.

653
00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.914
Escape.

654
00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.314
The metas in this city
have no respect for human life.

655
00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.471
They don't deserve
to breathe our air.

656
00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.240
You swore an oath to protect
the citizens of this city.

657
00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.277
Every one of them.

658
00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.199
Get him out of my sight.

659
00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:06.590
You know. your instincts
have always been sharp.

660
00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.911
But knowing he was going
to try to escape?

661
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.469
Could have sworn you were
reading Jonesy's mind.

662
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.798
It's a funny thing. yeah.

663
00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.674
Since Jenna was born.
I've been

664
00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.678
a lot more in touch
with my feelings.

665
00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.035
When Joe gets back.
the two of you

666
00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.874
will be a force
to be reckoned with.

667
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.191
Oh. we already are.

668
00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.599
Killer Frost.
you shouldn't have.

669
00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.776
<i>It's the closest
you're getting</i>

670
00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.110
<i>to an apology from me.
so...</i>

671
00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.195
Well. maybe that's why
I can hear you

672
00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.590
without the M.A.D. 2.0.

673
00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.592
Or maybe it's because
you've stopped hating me.

674
00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:57.680
<i>I didn't hate you.</i>

675
00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.274
<i>I thought
you were being stupid.</i>

676
00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:02.034
<i>There's a difference.</i>

677
00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:04.635
Hey. you know I'd never take
that cure. right?

678
00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.399
<i>Even if it means sharing
a body with me</i>

679
00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.312
<i>until you get old and grey?</i>

680
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.800
Of course.

681
00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.554
You're a part of me
that I never want to lose.

682
00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:16.475
I promise. I will do everything
I can to protect you.

683
00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.916
<i>Right back at you. Caity.</i>

684
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.480
<i>Now. don't get all soft on me.</i>

685
00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.776
<i>but I got you
a little something.</i>

686
00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.474
<i>Check the cooler.</i>

687
00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:38.554
Hey. Frosty.
Oh. Caitlin.

688
00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.919
Is that a ball of ice
with blood inside of it?

689
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.640
I think Killer Frost
took it from Cicada.

690
00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.311
Ralph. this isn't just blood.

691
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.431
This is a DNA sample from
a recently created meta-human.

692
00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.074
- So Killer Frost came around.
- Yeah.

693
00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.674
She did.

694
00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.336
<i>Ugh. I said don't get soft.</i>

695
00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:06.396
<i>Begin handwriting analysis.</i>

696
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:18.430
<i>As I suspected.
the journal of Nora West Allen</i>

697
00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.115
<i>contains two
different types of handwriting.</i>

698
00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.592
So...

699
00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:29.356
There is a mastermind
behind the scenes.

700
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.512
The only question is...

701
00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.074
who?

702
00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:47.239
Okay. 47 tacos
is officially my limit.

703
00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.795
I think that's
anyone's limit. honey.

704
00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.599
A healing speedster's
gotta eat.

705
00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:55.117
Healed. Dad.
I'm fine.

706
00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.634
I promise.

707
00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.360
Hey. uh.
dinner again tomorrow night?

708
00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:03.195
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Nora? Um...

709
00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.715
I just...

710
00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.719
just want you to know
how much we love you.

711
00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:27.869
See?
She's back to her old self.

712
00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.839
And so are you.

713
00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:34.436
No. I'm not.

714
00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:37.160
In fact. I don't think
I'll ever be the same.

715
00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:43.356
All of this has made me realize
that. I don't know.

716
00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:47.400
I just... I never knew I was
capable of even caring

717
00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.200
for someone as much
as I care about Nora.

718
00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.559
I did.

719
00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:58.231
I've never met anyone with
a bigger heart than you. Barry.

720
00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.917
So it's no surprise to me
that you are

721
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.357
a fantastic father.

722
00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.040
Just like you're
a fantastic husband.

723
00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.150
Cicada's a father. too.

724
00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.716
What if the key to defeating
him is appealing to his heart?

725
00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.554
How do we do that?
By saving his child.

726
00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.319
We need to wake up Grace.

727
00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.554
<i>Greg. move your head.</i>
