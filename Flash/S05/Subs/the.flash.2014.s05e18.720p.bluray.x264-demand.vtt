00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.116
<i>My name is Barry Allen and
I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.193
<i>To the outside world I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist.</i>

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.313
<i>But secretly with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs</i>

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.279
<i>I fight crime and find other
meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.556
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help.</i>

6
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.676
<i>she changed the present.</i>

7
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.475
<i>And now our world is more
dangerous than ever.</i>

8
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.870
<i>And I'm the only one fast
enough to save it.</i>

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.277
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

10
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.953
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

11
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.794
Follow my instructions
and we'll defeat Cicada.

12
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.872
Destroy his dagger
and save your father.

13
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.953
That is a new timeline
struggling to break through.

14
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.112
<i>Thawne.
another Cicada showed up.</i>

15
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.717
I used to think
that keeping secrets

16
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.776
from people would protect them.
but you can't really

17
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.439
know someone with
walls between you.

18
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.671
Eobard Thawne.
the Reverse Flash.

19
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.433
Your partner.
Your secret.

20
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.952
Dad. I'm sorry I lied to you!

21
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.679
So am I.

22
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.874
<i>Dad. please.
I wanted to tell you.</i>

23
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.153
<i>Dad! I tried to tell you.
I'm sorry I lied to you!</i>

24
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.312
<i>- It's Nora. our daughter.
- She lied to us. Iris.</i>

25
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.919
Since the first day
she got here.

26
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.514
about Thawne!

27
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.838
She knows what he did to us.
To me.

28
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.400
To my mother.

29
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.034
I can't believe
a word she says.

30
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.634
- We don't know that.
- Yes. we do!

31
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.996
We don't even know why
she's working with him.

32
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.869
Well. the pressing question
is not why Nora is working

33
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.553
<i>with the Reverse Flash.</i>

34
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.520
Maybe I can talk to her and
shed some light on the matter.

35
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.354
I think you've
shed enough light.

36
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.636
Why. are you upset at me?
What I should do?

37
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.336
I should just... I should not
have told you?

38
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.511
How long has it been
since you suspected her?

39
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.670
Since I arrived.

40
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.160
Wow.

41
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.856
So you've been following
this trail all this time

42
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.156
and you didn't think to tell
us about it until now?

43
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.232
I don't know where
this trail leads.

44
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.199
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm not kidding you.

45
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.715
You don't come to a conclusion
without facts.

46
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.154
All the facts.

47
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.991
Shirley. I think. uh.
maybe you should just give us

48
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.436
all a minute here.

49
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.960
What. you're mad at me
for doing what

50
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.440
a master detective does.

51
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.960
Figure out something
that you cannot.

52
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.993
I give you that translation.
Your anger is misplaced.

53
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.717
Look. whatever reason
Nora didn't tell us.

54
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.792
I don't think
she did it maliciously.

55
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.239
Guys. even from here.
I can feel how upset she is.

56
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.039
All right. babe.
you've been around Nora

57
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.190
for months.

58
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.296
You never felt that she
was hiding something before.

59
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.313
No. never.
Never.

60
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.916
Well. Thawne lied.
He was a master at it.

61
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.957
It stands to reason he must
have taught Nora some

62
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.872
- of his same tricks.
- Maybe.

63
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.952
Maybe not.

64
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.656
There's gotta be some way
to figure it out.

65
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.480
There is.

66
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.776
I'm guessing this
has everything

67
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.951
from the day she arrived.

68
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.554
<i>Maybe before.</i>

69
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.634
Read it.

70
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.439
From the beginning.

71
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.416
<i>Please stand back
from the perimeter.</i>

72
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.794
<i>Excuse me. Sorry.</i>

73
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.031
Uh. excuse me.
Excuse me. pardon me.

74
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.856
<i>- Incoming call from Mom.</i>
- Mom. come on.

75
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.872
Ooh!
I'm so sorry.

76
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.155
I just... I'm really late.

77
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.072
I'm... I'm really late
for an important date.

78
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.436
Not a date. date.
Not that I don't date. date.

79
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.239
I date. date.
It's just. I have a meeting.

80
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.357
I'm making myself later.
Sorry.

81
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.917
Anyone seen CSI?

82
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.096
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

83
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.349
Where is West-Allen?

84
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.113
Ah. I'm so sorry.
Detective Curtis.

85
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.429
I didn't mean to be late.

86
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.256
I tried to hail a hover-taxi
but they kept passing me by

87
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.416
and then I had to run
all the way from...

88
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.320
I really don't care what

89
00:03:55.321 --> 00:03:56.760
your reason is this time.
West-Allen.

90
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.917
I just wanna find
what meta did this.

91
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.878
Of course.

92
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.794
Chemical transport truck
on its way to Dayton Labs

93
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.678
<i>was attacked
earlier this morning.</i>

94
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.436
But that makes two labs
and another two transports

95
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.755
this week.

96
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.036
And like the others.
no one saw anyone.

97
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.560
God. there's
residue everywhere.

98
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.996
<i>- Benzene Methanol.</i>
- That's what they stole.

99
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.150
What's that used for?

100
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.479
Anything from nanotech
to treating lice.

101
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.120
<i>- Halothane.</i>
- Halothane?

102
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.238
Wait a second.

103
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.320
What?

104
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.315
This truck has an
Affinity 4.000 security camera.

105
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.357
God. Lia's gonna be so jealous.

106
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.079
Whenever the 4.000's
tampered with.

107
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.551
its failsafe releases
a incapacitating agent.

108
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.194
Halothane.

109
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.431
So you're saying whoever
did this picked the lock.

110
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.556
disabled the camera.

111
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.200
and stole might-be-lice
medicine?

112
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.079
All before this incapacitating
agent could do its job?

113
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.675
And no one saw them.

114
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.353
How is that possible?

115
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.394
<i>A speedster?</i>

116
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.836
Nora. labmate.
friend of mine.

117
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.736
you didn't happen to pitch
your speedster theory

118
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.319
to Detective Curtis. did you?

119
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.757
It is not a theory. Lia.
It is the only explanation.

120
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.276
You know I'm equally a fan

121
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.680
of our fleet-footed
super friends.

122
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.552
I mean. honestly.
if I could have ever

123
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.757
met Jesse Quick. it's like.
hello. new best friend.

124
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.720
- No offense. um...
- Some taken.

125
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.960
Okay. but there hasn't been
a speedster in Central City

126
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.037
since that Crisis piece
your mom wrote about. like.

127
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.190
decades ago.

128
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.317
I mean. Flash. Kid Flash.
Jay Garrick.

129
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.736
that... that weird purple
speedster that just

130
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.958
showed up one day.
They're all gone.

131
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.431
So what you're suggesting.
highly unlikely.

132
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.720
Then we need
to start believing

133
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.319
in the highly unlikely.

134
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.710
Alternatively. um.
you could...

135
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.480
Dial back your obsessiveness.

136
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.960
I'm not obsessive.

137
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.594
You never got
to know your dad.

138
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.990
So you became a CSI
just like him.

139
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.596
and it's why you keep
investigating the one case

140
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.592
Barry Allen never solved.

141
00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.160
Cicada.

142
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.950
You call that obsessive.
I call that a hobby.

143
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.239
Right. your. um... your classic
everyday...

144
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.390
murder hobby.

145
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.551
It's like your mom says.

146
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.792
You're. uh... you're excessive.

147
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.236
Do not quote my mother.

148
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.976
God. I wish CCPD would
spring for one

149
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.434
of these Affinity cameras.

150
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.080
I mean. trillion FPS.
captures light in motion.

151
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.720
W-T-Shrap?

152
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.918
- That's lightning.
- The canister's gone.

153
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.595
White lightning.
A speedster.

154
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.990
- Okay. maybe.
- No. not maybe.

155
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.230
It is! I knew it!

156
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.834
Okay. fine. you're right.
But...

157
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.032
But what is a speedster
doing stealing chemicals?

158
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.515
<i>And Eobard Thawne.

- I know.

162
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.991
<i>Incoming call from Mom.</i>

163
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.317
See? I knew it.

164
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.915
There was never a speedster
with white lightning.

165
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.237
- All yours.
- Thanks.

166
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.518
<i>Thank you for visiting
the Flash Museum today.</i>

167
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.637
<i>The building will be closing
in five minutes.</i>

168
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.474
<i>All guests should make their
way to the exit now.</i>

169
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.200
<i>And Nora West-Allen.
your mother called.</i>

170
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.999
<i>Please.
for your sake and mine.</i>

171
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.639
<i>call her back.</i>

172
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.912
So embarrassing.

173
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.959
Mom. why are you calling
Mr. Myles?

174
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.056
<i>I tried you at your lab.
You weren't answering.</i>

175
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.080
<i>I left three messages.</i>

176
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.514
<i>You never returned
any of them.</i>

177
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.736
<i>What else was
I supposed to do?</i>

178
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.319
Wait for me to call you back?

179
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.669
<i>Why isn't your holo on?</i>

180
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.036
Uh. it doesn't work
in the Flash Museum.

181
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.496
<i>For the life of me.
I've never understood</i>

182
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.795
<i>your obsession
with that place.</i>

183
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.395
<i>What are you even doing there?
Are you there alone?</i>

184
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.676
It's fine. Mom.
I'm researching a case.

185
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.956
<i>- What kind of case?</i>
- One that I can't talk about.

186
00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.400
<i>I'm your mother. Nora.</i>

187
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.756
And I'm an employee
of CCPD who can't talk

188
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.990
about open cases.

189
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.576
Mom. how many times do I have
to tell you this?

190
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.478
You were married to a CSI.

191
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.392
<i>Yes. I was.</i>

192
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.514
I'm sorry.

193
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.239
What were you calling about?

194
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.438
<i>I thought my daughter might
want to know how I'm doing</i>

195
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.910
<i>in Coast City.
I almost finished my story.</i>

196
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.673
<i>I should be home
in a few days.</i>

197
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.797
Great.

198
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.519
Uh. Mom. I gotta go.
It's work.

199
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.795
<i>- Love you.</i>
- Love you.

200
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.075
Hey.

201
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.536
<i>Hey. meet me
at Ollins Laboratory.</i>

202
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.416
<i>I sent the list of stolen
chemicals to an old teacher</i>

203
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.830
<i>of mine and I think
he found something.</i>

204
00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.518
Appreciate the help.
Dr. Bonwit.

205
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.592
- especially at this hour.
- Not a problem.

206
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.797
Ollins never lets me leave
this place anyway.

207
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.736
So Lia was telling me you
might know how these chemicals

208
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.797
- can be used together.
- Yes and no.

209
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.838
Took me a bit to see it.
but the only way they seem

210
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.560
to work together is if they're
built on a structure.

211
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.552
Like an extracellular matrix.

212
00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.832
But there are thousands
of extracellular matrices.

213
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.136
So until we know
all the chemicals.

214
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.755
we won't know the end results.

215
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.399
Sorry I can't help more.

216
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.557
- That's okay.
- Thanks. Dr. Bonwit.

217
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.754
Now what?

218
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.514
We can't just wait
for another lab to get hit.

219
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.758
Holy shrap!

220
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.520
Dr. Bonwit!

221
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.034
Oh. my God!

222
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.234
Yes. I am a god.

223
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.470
The god of speed.

224
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.313
Go. go. go. go. go!

225

Nora!

226
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.797
Nora!

227
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.032

Someone help!

228

would wake you up.

233
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.231
Okay. don't freak.
Uh. we're in a hospital.

234
00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.200
Me for this burn and you
for a whole lot more.

235
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.999
- Dr. Bonwit?
- Uh. ICU.

236
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.200
But he's gonna pull through.

237
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.616
Um. but the speedster did get
away with. like. a crazy amount

238
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.835
of Carbon Disulfide.

239
00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.718
Don't worry about
that right now.

240
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.120
How are you feeling?

241
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.396
I... I feel fine. actually.

242
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.115
My fingers are a little tingly
but other than that.

243
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.999
I... I feel really good.
It's weird. right?

244
00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.514
I'm just so glad you're okay.

245
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.195
Your doctor said you got hit
with five billion joules

246
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.917
of electricity.
Which means. um. I. uh...

247
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.879
I. uh. kind of called your mom.
Um. and she. uh...

248
00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.078
She freaked more than normal.
Um. I had to.

249
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.880
- You could have died.
- Lia. is she here?

250
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.256
She's on her way
from Coast City.

251
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.431
Uh. and she is wearing
her aggro pants.

252
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.591
I mean. she has called me.
like. 47 times.

253
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.800
You should have ignored her.

254
00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.896
I just... I don't want
her to worry.

255
00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.240
I did.

256
00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.596
Uh. which is why she
doesn't know about this.

257
00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.696
The paramedics said that
you went into cardiac arrest

258
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.736
when you got here and so they
had to use the defib nodes

259
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.752
to restart your heart.
and when they did.

260
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.069
they found this.

261
00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.720
It was buried underneath the
scar under your right shoulder.

262
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.598
What is it?

263
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.433
They say it's a metal
scrap from the shelf

264
00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.352
you got thrown into.
but I don't know.

265
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.036
It looks kind of old
and... and pretty fried.

266
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.080
Okay. wait. but now that
we both know you're okay.

267
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.954
can we please talk about
the fact that you got struck

268
00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.560
by lightning from a speedster?

269
00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.835
So schway. right?

270
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.416
The only thing is no one's
gonna believe us.

271
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.477
We both saw it.
They're gonna have to.

272
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.998
<i>Stay calm.</i>

273
00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.879
<i>There has been an incident.
System check in progress.</i>

274
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.078
What the hell?

275
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.759
<i>Catch this.</i>

276
00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.075
I'm okay!

277
00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.470
You sure?

278
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.236
Yeah. dude.
I'm a speedster.

279
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.994
All of my nerves are tingling
and my synapses must be

280
00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:12.114
going crazy because my reaction
times are way off the charts.

281
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.719
What am I gonna do
about my mom?

282
00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.350
She freaks out any time someone
even says the word meta.

283
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.760
Okay. well.
that's understandable.

284
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.110
I mean. her non-meta husband
died because of metas.

285
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.318
Yeah. but writing about
the Flash... the meta-human...

286
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.960
- made her career.
- So we can't tell her?

287
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.191
No. we can't tell anybody.

288
00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.840
Not until we figure out
how I got these powers.

289
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.310
And I don't think it's a
coincidence that this happened

290
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.478
after my little run-in
with the god of speed guy.

291
00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.270
You mean when Godspeed
hit you with his lightning.

292
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.800
Which. according
to the Flash Museum.

293
00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.399
is exactly what happened to...

294
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.597
The Flash.

295
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.038
<i>10-90 in progress.</i>

296
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.430
Bank heist.

297
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.079
Huh.

298
00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.560
No. no.
You can't do that.

299
00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.640
That is a bad idea.

300
00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.313
That is like cut
your own bangs bad.

301
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.471
I'm just gonna do
a little run-by.

302
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.438
You are a CSI.
not a superhero.

303
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.796
Our jobs are the same
as the cops.

304
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.156
We get the bad guys.

305
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.677
All right.
Go get 'em. Flash Woman.

306
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.274
Lady Flash.

307
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.635
Hot Flash.

308
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.520
Not that one.

309
00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.080
Okay. we're gonna workshop
that later.

310
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.113
Until then.
I have to guard Central City.

311
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.395
Ah!

312
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.880
Stop or I'll fire!

313
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.238
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

314
00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.830
Oh. um. I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

315
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.311
Freeze!

316
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.153
Oh. uh...

317
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.276
What in the world?

318
00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.511
Bug and Byte.
you're under arrest!

319
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.512
Go. go. go!
Take them down!

320
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.030
You fried your gauntlet
and half the fleet.

321
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.032
It was only three cruisers.

322
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.396
Now Captain Frye's gonna be
on his warpath

323
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.256
which is gonna make
everybody's life miserable.

324
00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.999
I'm sorry. Nora.

325
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.437
I know today didn't exactly
go so great.

326
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.718
Both robbers got away
because of me.

327
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.471
Cut yourself a slice
of slack pie.

328
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.597
It was your first day.
No one got hurt.

329
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.336
And plus they found Bug
and Byte hunched over

330
00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.272
with runner's cramps. like.
ten minutes later.

331
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.670
But I still feel so bad.

332
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.513
You're looking
at this all wrong.

333
00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.439
Today was not Nora's
big failure.

334
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.190
Today was the Femme-Flash's
big debut.

335
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.559
Naming superheroes is not easy.

336
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.151
Lia. you are the best friend
a shrappy speedster

337
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.873
could ever ask for.

338
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.918
But I think we both know
that CCPD isn't equipped

339
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.753
to stop this guy.

340
00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.036
The only way we're gonna
catch him before

341
00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.272
anyone else gets hurt
is if I start thinking

342
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.352
like a villainous speedster.

343
00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.193
And how are you
gonna do that?

344
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.192
I'm gonna go see one.

345
00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.194
<i>Reverse-Flash. huh?</i>

346
00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.717
Well. officer. you're. like.
the second person in 15 years

347
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.315
who's come to visit
this psychopath.

348
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.676
Not even a call.

349
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.639
Are you sure you want
to interview him by yourself?

350
00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.951
I've been alone
with criminals before.

351
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.430
Hmm.

352
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.077
You have five minutes.

353
00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.673
Eobard Thawne?

354
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.474
My name is Nora West-Allen.
and I'm a CSI tech

355
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.960
with the CCPD.

356
00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.316
I wanted to ask you
a few questions. if I could.

357
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.269
Come closer.

358
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.234
Nora West-Allen.

359
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.031
Don't be afraid.

360
00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.352
The dampening capabilities
of this cell can negate

361
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.160
the powers of 1.000
meta-humans.

362
00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.631
The glass. the walls.
the ceiling. the floors

363
00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.440
are all connected to a power
energizer that will zap

364
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.600
this place with
400 kilojoules instantly

365
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.195
should the dampeners fail.

366
00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.511
Making the cell phase-proof.

367
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.555
I couldn't hurt you.
Nora West-Allen.

368
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.193
Even if I wanted to.

369
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.833
What are your questions?

370
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.353
How did you end up in here?

371
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.591
Was there nobody at CCPD
that could answer

372
00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.239
that question for you?

373
00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.437
All the files pertaining
to the Reverse-Flash

374
00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.920
have been cyber locked.

375
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.038
And there's almost nothing
about you in the Flash Museum.

376
00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.237
except for the date
of your imprisonment.

377
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.312
Really?

378
00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.000
That's all there is
in the Flash Museum?

379
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.474
That's interesting.

380
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.756
Will you tell me how
you were defeated?

381
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.160
Why do you want to know that?

382
00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.512
It'll help us with
an investigation.

383
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.035
You need to work
on your lying.

384
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.640
Nora.

385
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.840
Your shoes are new.

386
00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.560
But your soles are worn.

387
00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.597
You have singe marks
on your sleeves

388
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.353
and singe marks
on your pant legs.

389
00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.909
but most of all.
your cheeks are flushed

390
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.514
with windburn.

391
00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.477
Oh. I know that windburn.

392
00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.552
I can still feel it.

393
00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.239
You're a speedster.

394
00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.076
Time's up.

395
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.840
Please. I need your help.

396
00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:21.920
Come on. Let's go.

397
00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.391
Time to repent. Professor.

398
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.276
Thawne figured out
I had powers.

399
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.234
but he wouldn't tell me
anything about them.

400
00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.280
What?

401
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.856
And don't tell me it's nothing.
'cause your whole face

402
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.792
says it's something.

403
00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.917
You know this metal
fragment they found

404
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.231
- underneath your shoulder?
- Yeah.

405
00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.118
Well. something about it
was bugging me.

406
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.112
so I did some digging.

407
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.590
It turns out it's not from that
shelf you got thrown into.

408
00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.478
It's. uh... It's tech.

409
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:20.031
A chip made by S.T.A.R. Labs
25 years ago.

410
00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.033
Like a chip you would use
to find a lost animal?

411
00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.320
- It's to dampen your speed.
- What?

412
00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.600
You didn't get your powers
when Godspeed hit you

413
00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.876
with his lightning.

414
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.838
It looks like you
always had them.

415
00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.958
I... I've always had powers?

416
00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.592
Why do... Who would put a power
dampening chip inside of...

417
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.157
Your mom lied
to you your whole life.

418
00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.472
I mean. that's
next-level aggro.

419
00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.376
How could she keep something
like that from me?

420
00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.869
I mean. what else
has she lied to me about?

421
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.713
I think you're gonna have
to ask her.

422
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.269
Oh. just the idea of that
makes my blood boil.

423
00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.555
That could be the macchiato.

424
00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.717
It's possible I might have
made that a triple.

425
00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.120
At least I have one person
in my life I can still trust.

426
00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.040
- A triple.
- That's been established.

427
00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.113
No. no. no. not the coffee.
I mean. yes. the coffee.

428
00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.232
But the chemicals
that Godspeed stole.

429
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.960
Benzene Methanol is unstable.
and if you add

430
00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.600
the Carbon Disulfide that
he stole from Ollins lab...

431
00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.680
Kablooey.

432
00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.416
I remember that from
9th grade Analytical Chem.

433
00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.576
And the only way to combine
all those chemicals together

434
00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.672
is if you add some kind
of binding property.

435
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.520
Right. you'd need a plus-one
oxidation state.

436
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.517
like a... a Dioxygen Diflouride.

437
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.360
Yes. and somewhere that's
able to store that.

438
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.074
and the only place
in Central City that can

439
00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.276
is Stagg Industries.

440
00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.111
I cannot believe my first
time at Stagg Industries

441
00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.839
is as a burglar.

442
00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.957
Or are we vigilantes?

443
00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.359
Lia. I found it.

444
00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.598
Unless your super speed
came with super biceps.

445
00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.194
we are not getting
this out of here.

446
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.675
That's mine.

447
00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.272
Uh. okay.
Try and get this open.

448
00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.680
It'll evaporate in seconds.

449
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.480
If you want it. you're gonna
have to come through me

450
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.789
to get it.

451
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.952
Ah. you're a speedster
like me.

452
00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.350
So you need it too.

453
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.909
Sorry.

454
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.717
No!

455
00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.633
Lia! Lia!

456
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.155
Lia!

457
00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.277
Lia!

458
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.875
The one person in the world
she thought she could trust

459
00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.553
died in her arms.

460
00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.677
Nora must have felt
completely alone.

461
00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.475
- But she wasn't.
- Yes. she was.

462
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.273
Because I wasn't
honest with her.

463
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.680
Iris...

464
00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.520
After all I did.
she gave me a second chance.

465
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.680
It's the least
we can do for her.

466
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.674
Mom?

467
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.558
Don't make me regret this.

468
00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.393
What are you doing?

469
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.416
I'm giving our daughter
the chance to explain this

470
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.715
for herself.

471
00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.912
Nora.

472
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.395
I heard about... Lia.

473
00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.994
Honey. I'm so sorry.

474
00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.070
I know how it is to lose
someone you love.

475
00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.456
If you don't wanna talk
about it right now.

476
00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.790
that's okay.

477
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.839
Or maybe you just don't wanna
talk about it with me.

478
00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:56.671
Nora. can I just make sure
that you're okay?

479
00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.480
Nora. I went to the hospital
and they said that you left.

480
00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.279
Yeah.

481
00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.829
I guess lightning doesn't
hurt as much when you already

482
00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.872
have it coursing
through your veins.

483
00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.916
Does this look familiar?

484
00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.794
How about now?

485
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.117
- Nora...
- Lia found it before she died.

486
00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.873
You put this inside of me. Mom.

487
00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.113
To dampen my powers?

488
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.998
You lied to me my whole life.

489
00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.633
I know.

490
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.632
Who else knows?

491
00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.513
Who else?

492
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.320
Everyone.

493
00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.956
Everybody?

494
00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.636
Everyone that I love
has been keeping this from me?

495
00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.519
- Why?
- Because I told them to.

496
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.600
Why would you do that?

497
00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.313
Nora. I was trying
to protect you.

498
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.437
- From what?
- From this city.

499
00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.672
From... from meta-humans.
From... from...

500
00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.876
yourself.

501
00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.599
Wow.

502
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.515
- Nora. you don't understand.
- No. I don't understand.

503
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.034
How did I get my powers?

504
00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.336
What do you have
against speedsters?

505
00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.400
Nora. I have already
lost so much.

506
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.358
I can't risk losing you too.

507
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.359
Well. you just did.

508
00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.991
I'm gonna miss Lia too.

509
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.632
West-Allen. we all know
how close you two were.

510
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.110
If you need some time off.
I'm sure Captain Frye...

511
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.317
We need to get the guy
who did this.

512
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.790
Whatever it takes.

513
00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.480
We ran the evidence
from the crime scene.

514
00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:03.076
Turns out there was foreign DNA
in Lia's exit wound.

515
00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.631
But we've used it
to positively ID this guy.

516
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.554
August Hart.
Bio-hacker.

517
00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.156
Mercury Labs intern.
and then grad school.

518
00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.040
All yours.

519
00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.840
Says he was kicked out
for testing tachyon stimulants

520
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.118
on coma patients.
What the hell's a tachyon?

521
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.237
A particle that moves
faster than light.

522
00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.039
Well. an arrest warrant's
on its way now.

523
00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.555
I promise you this guy's gonna
get what he deserves.

524
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.114
Yes. he will.

525
00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.239
<i>Did you know
not all villains</i>

526
00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.277
<i>had meta-human powers?
Some u-</i>

527
00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:53.193
<i>Make sure you get this.
Everybody move!</i>

528
00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.235
Godspeed's lightning...

529
00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.517
It turned blue.
just like Zoom's.

530
00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.279
Hey. wait a sec.

531
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.792
<i>Although her body
disintegrated.</i>

532
00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.951
<i>authorities uncovered evidence
at Mercury Labs</i>

533
00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.713
<i>of the illegal
speed-enhancement drug.</i>

534
00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.598
<i>Velocity-9.</i>

535
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.559
<i>This volatile stimulant
gave Trajectory incredible speed.</i>

536
00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.155
<i>but at a deadly price.</i>

537
00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.356
That's it.

538
00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:29.433
Benzene Methanol.
Carbon Disulfide.

539
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.273
Dioxygen Diflouride.

540
00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.512
The base for the extracellular
matrix for Velocity-9.

541
00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:38.640
Only he's trying to make one
that will last forever.

542
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.114
How do I stop a speedster?

543
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.431
- You can't.
- Not alone.

544
00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.955
But with you. I can.

545
00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.839
No.

546
00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.276
That plinth.
it takes incoming calls.

547
00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.352
and from what I hear.
you have a few left.

548
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.432
You could walk me through
it via comms.

549
00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.590
No.

550
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.717
He has stolen enough
chemicals to make

551
00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.679
an extracellular matrix
that replicates speed powers.

552
00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.240
I told you to leave.

553
00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.096
The only thing that
is stopping him from becoming

554
00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.589
a speedster permanently
is a stabilizing agent.

555
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.554
Once he gets that.
he will be unstoppable.

556
00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.558
I told you to leave!
Guard!

557
00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.194
Please.

558
00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.273
He killed my best friend
in front of me.

559
00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.713
She's gone because of him.
and you are the only person

560
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.757
that can stop it.

561
00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:49.955
What the hell?
You need to leave now.

562
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.514
Nora.

563
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.314
Okay. I'm at the
innovation lab at CCU.

564
00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.232
- Are you there?
- Yes. I'm here.

565
00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.676
Okay. are you sure this
is gonna short out

566
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.353
- the scanner circuits?
- Yes. I'm sure.

567
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.035
Vibrate your hands together.
Build an electric shock.

568
00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.190
Okay.

569
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.754
Schway.

570
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.240
It worked.

571
00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:33.636
<i>Now look for the brightest
room.</i>

572
00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.629
<i>The converter needs constant
fluorescent light.</i>

573
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.999
Now locate
the biometric converter.

574
00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.833
<i>It will be a kidney-shaped
object</i>

575
00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.920
I think I found it.

576
00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.954
No way for Godspeed to
stabilize his Velocity-9 now.

577
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.274
You don't learn. do you?

578
00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.840
That's mine.

579
00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.593
Come and get it.

580
00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.673
It worked!

581
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.639
No.
He's got more V-9.

582
00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.496
Nora. you need to get out
of there now.

583
00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.193
<i>Right now!</i>

584
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.351
I can't lose him!

585
00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.550
Thawne!

586
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.916
<i>Did you hear me?
I said I can't lose him!</i>

587
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.913
All right. Nora.
do you see any walls

588
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.753
<i>near where you are.
preferably concrete?</i>

589
00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.069
Why?

590
00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.038
Because I want you
to run into one.

591
00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.351
Or rather. through one.

592
00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.656
I can't run through
a concrete wall!

593
00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.114
Yes. you can.

594
00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.112
If you vibrate at the natural
frequency of air.

595
00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.034
your body. your cells.
will be in such a state that they

596
00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.634
will phase right
through that wall.

597
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.916
I can't do this!

598
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.640
Nora. listen to me.

599
00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.235
<i>Listen to my voice.</i>

600
00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.994
Breathe.

601
00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.039
<i>Breathe.</i>

602
00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.830
Feel the wind on your face.

603
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.355
The ground beneath your feet.

604
00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.120
And the lightning.

605
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.637
<i>Its electricity surging
through your veins.</i>

606
00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.872
To your nerve endings
from the crown of your head

607
00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.590
to the tips of your toes
like an electric shock

608
00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.399
you never want to end.

609
00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.314
<i>You're part of something
greater now. Nora.</i>

610
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:42.952
You are part of the
Speed Force and its power.

611
00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.999
its power is yours to use.
Now do it.

612
00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.795
I can't.

613
00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.030
<i>I can't do it.</i>

614
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.154
Then good-bye. Little Runner.

615
00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:08.439
No. no.
Uh. I'm sorry.

616
00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.877
I trust you.
Uh. what now?

617
00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.673
Nora. you can't run forever.

618
00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.116
<i>You're gonna have to stop him.</i>

619
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.839
Tell me what you
see around you.

620
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.118
Um. uh. I'm on 5th and Park.

621
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.238
I see Choi Enterprises.
Peercoin Bank.

622
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.073
and CC Citizen Media.

623
00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.514
Media. the satellites.

624
00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.876
Nora. we're gonna use
the satellites' electromagnetic

625
00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.792
radiation to break
the V-9 bonds.

626
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.792
Flood Godspeed
with anti-endorphins.

627
00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.712
Neutralizing
the V-9 instantly.

628
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.029
Exactly.
but here's the thing.

629
00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.918
Those satellites recalibrate
on the hour.

630
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.151
emitting very short bursts
of microwave energy.

631
00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.516
You're only gonna have a few
seconds to get Godspeed

632
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.398
in front of those bursts.
Do you understand?

633
00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.711
So I just need him to follow
me into the building.

634
00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:53.350
Not into the building.
Up the building.

635
00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.875
Uh. okay.
I can do that.

636
00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:59.112
Um. how fast do I have to go
to run up a building?

637
00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.510
As fast as you can.

638
00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.520
Here he comes.

639
00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.879
Then run. Nora.

640
00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:09.830
Run.

641
00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:26.471
Wait for it. Nora.
Wait.

642
00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.120
<i>And now!</i>

643
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.074
Nora.
Nora!

644
00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.355
We did it!

645
00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.914
<i>We did it.</i>

646
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.878
Yes. we did.

647
00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.960
<i>Well. we don't have to worry
about Godspeed anymore.</i>

648
00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.473
August Hart is in
the custody of CCPD.

649
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.276
Bravo. Little Runner.

650
00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.039
I still have a lot to learn.
you know.

651
00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.436
- You could train me.
- I can't train you. Nora.

652
00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.518
There's just not enough time.

653
00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.153
What... what are
you talking about?

654
00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.391
- You're...
- Nora.

655
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.551
My time on this earth
is coming to an end.

656
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.993
There's so much
I wanted to ask you.

657
00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.639
So much that
I still don't know.

658
00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:48.951
So much that my mom
has lied to me about.

659
00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.915
You have no idea.

660
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.320
What do you know?

661
00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.432
Thawne. please. you may be
the only person left

662
00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.159
in my life who won't lie to me.

663
00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.070
Nora.

664
00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:10.320
how much do you really know
about the Flash?

665
00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.474
Five. six. seven.

666
00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.556
Holy shrap.

667
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.593
<i>Good evening.
Nora West-Allen.</i>

668
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.832
Um. hi.

669
00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.752
Uh...

670
00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.069
You know who I am?

671
00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.391
<i>Of course.
Nora West-Allen.</i>

672
00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.790
<i>Daughter of Iris West
and Barry Allen.</i>

673
00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.076
<i>also known as the Flash.</i>

674
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.800
Wh...

675
00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.917
S... Did you...

676
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.199
Did you just say my father.
Barry Allen.

677
00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.999
was the Flash?

678
00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.992
<i>Would you like me to play
your video message.</i>

679
00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.270
<i>Nora West-Allen?</i>

680
00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.191
My... My message?

681
00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.920
<i>Yes. from your father.
Barry Allen.</i>

682
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.232
Uh. y... yes.

683
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.597
<i>Nora.</i>

684
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.080
<i>I don't have much time.</i>

685
00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.594
<i>If you're watching this.
it means you're like me.</i>

686
00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.920
<i>You have powers.</i>

687
00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.296
<i>It also means I wasn't there
to help you learn</i>

688
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.880
<i>how to use them.</i>

689
00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:43.397
<i>I wasn't there
for a lot of things.</i>

690
00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.996
<i>Remember. my sweet Nora.</i>

691
00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:52.075
<i>always remember.
I love you.</i>

692
00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.719
<i>I always will.</i>

693
00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.110
I just wanted to see you. Dad.

694
00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.037
Thawne...

695
00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.713
showed me how.

696
00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.709
And Cicada?

697
00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.520
The one case
we both couldn't solve.

698
00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:31.591
It was my idea
to come here and make it right.

699
00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.312
Okay.

700
00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.637
Can I have a minute alone
with Nora?

701
00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.880
Of course.

702
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.795
How many times
did you go back to Thawne?

703
00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.200
How many times?

704
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.794
After the night
of the Enlightenment.

705
00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:05.598
Five. uh. maybe six.

706
00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.836
Even knowing
he killed my mother?

707
00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:14.391
- Dad...
- I understand...

708
00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.837
coming back to meet me...

709
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.240
and the team.

710
00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.118
I do.

711
00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.669
I even understand
going to Thawne...

712
00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.429
to learn how to do it. but...

713
00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.354
you kept going back.

714
00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.920
Even after you knew
what he did.

715
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.596
Even after he wasn't
your only option anymore.

716
00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.671
And the worst part is.
you lied to us every time.

717
00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:42.194
D-Dad. I...

718
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.351
I don't trust you. Nora.

719
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.472
I can't have
anybody here with us

720
00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.553
that I don't trust anymore.

721
00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.993
W-what are you saying?

722
00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.954
It's time for you to go home.

723
00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.599
Dad. please don't do this!

724
00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:08.310
I promise I will never
see Thawne again!

725
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.357
Dad. don't do this!

726
00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.239
Nora. if you try
to run back in time again.

727
00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.915
I will feel it
in the Speed Force.

728
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.593
I'll know.

729
00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.239
Good-bye. Nora.

730
00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.037
So she finally came clean.

731
00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:53.954
Or did you figure it out
all by yourself?

732
00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.679
One wasn't enough?

733
00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.200
You had to try to take
my daughter from me too?

734
00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.309
My daughter!

735
00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:07.080
I knew you'd react like this.

736
00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.514
You're always so emotional.

737
00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:12.150
which is why I had her
keep all of this from you.

738
00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.749
You can't blame
the Little Runner. Barry.

739
00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.514
She just wanted to spend
some time with her dad.

740
00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.678
Don't hold that against her.

741
00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.840
Consider it a condemned man's
last request.

742
00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:30.956
You always thought you were

743
00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.077
so much smarter
than us. Thawne.

744
00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.193
But you lost.

745
00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.278
And now you're finally gonna
get what you deserve.

746
00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.560
<i>Greg. move your head!</i>
