<i>My name is Barry Allen</i>

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.236
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.199
<i>To the outside world I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist.</i>

4
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.313
<i>But secretly. with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs</i>

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.154
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.550
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help.</i>

7
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.871
<i>she changed the present.</i>

8
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.475
<i>and now our world
is more dangerous than ever.</i>

9
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.995
<i>and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

10
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.072
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

11
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.953
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

12
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.270
Ah!

13
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.794
<i>What is that?</i>

14
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.793
<i>It's a game my dad
and I used to play.</i>

15
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.475
<i>It's a letter from my dad.
He's still alive.</i>

16
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.956
You put a power dampening
chip inside me

17
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.235
to take away my speed.

18
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.616
Is that why
you've been so cold to me?

19
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.216
Why you don't want to spend
any time with me?

20
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.197
<i>Mom thinks
that she had good reason</i>

21
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.397
to suppress my powers
in the future.

22
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.039
I support her decisions.

23
00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.354
Let's just call it. Barry.
She's not coming. Again.

24
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.512
She's probably
just helping with Jenna

25
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.159
so Joe
and Cecile can sleep in.

26
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.357
Every day
for the past two weeks?

27
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.955
They look really tired.

28
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.117
They do.

29
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.112
<i>Tripped alarm
at Central City Art Gallery.</i>

30
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.876
- Someone stole a Monet.
- At 10:00 a.m.? That's bold.

31
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.953
CCPD's en route.
suspect heading west on Ruger.

32
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.296
<i>The thiefjust turned
on to Ramirez off of Fifth.</i>

33
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.674
<i>Almost there.</i>

34
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.435
He's not carrying anything.

35
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.136
<i>Because he handed it off
to someone else.</i>

36
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.276
- Nora?
- Nora?

37
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.040
- Uh. where's he headed?
<i>- I got him.</i>

38
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.594
<i>I can stop someone
on a motorcycle.</i>

39
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.433
No. Nora.
let Barry help. okay...

40
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.197
I know you did not just
cut me off from this thing.

41
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.236
Gotcha.

42
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.753
Are you okay?

43
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.875
This is why we train. Nora.
Every single day.

44
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.896
Not when you feel like it.
not because you're mad.

45
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.798
and why you
always have someone in your ear

46
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.320
when you're in the field
to help you.

47
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.556
- I know that.
- Then why did you turn me off?

48
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.030
Because I can't
listen to you anymore.

49
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.640
It's always
the same condescending.

50
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.518
I-know-better-than-you crap.

51
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.751
I just want to be me
and you sit behind your desk

52
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.069
and you say "no"
every time

53
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.296
and I've been hearing it my
whole life and I'm sick of it.

54
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.118
- Your whole life?
- Yes. Mom.

55
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.080
Since I can remember.
and you never change.

56
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.557
Iris.

57
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.838
You know. Nora. I wish you
would try to understand

58
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.480
who your mom is today.

59
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.632
and stop seeing her as who she
becomes in the future.

60
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.751
- That's for you.
- The hell is this?

61
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.720
Well. that's the hours
to apply against my debt.

62
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.190
Fruitful hours spent getting
closer to uncovering

63
00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.000
the identity of your
serial meta-killer. Cicada.

64
00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.080
And how's that?

65
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.237
Well. I apply a complex
formula... complex for you.

66
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.040
involving the terminal
velocity and the weight

67
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.536
of the S.T.A.R. Labs' satellite
and the velocity of Barry

68
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.677
and Nora traveling
when they...

69
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.791
destroy the satellite. right.
allowing me to conclude that...

70
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.556
The debris from the satellite.
the satellite shrapnel.

71
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.200
and the man
who will become our Cicada

72
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.711
would be found
within this perimeter.

73
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.712
And that took you how long?

74
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.916
Oof. Dr. Snow.

75
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.676
Eighteen hours 'cause I'm only
semi-excellent at algebra.

76
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.240
You know this is calculus.
right?

77
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.959
Guys. look.
calculon. algebra.

78
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.976
either way it doesn't tell us
where the shrapnel fell.

79
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.992
<i>Mais non.</i> You have to scan
the entire city

80
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.560
to find
the exact location.

81
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.791
Okay. so you need Sally
the satellite to find

82
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.792
Sally the satellite
and we need Thomas Snow

83
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.075
to point us
to Thomas Snow.

84
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.629
- You lost him.
- At Thomas Snow.

85
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.155
We've hit a dead end
with regards to my father.

86
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.000
I looked through all
of his notes and papers.

87
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.736
There's no more hidden
messages we could use.

88
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.232
A satellite to run DNA
recognition patterns but...

89
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.312
I thought losing him
when I was ten was hard. but.

90
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.754
the idea that he's out there

91
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.480
and I might not be able
to get to him...

92
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.711
Maybe I can help you.

93
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.439
I thought your powers
weren't working.

94
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.592
No. not fully.
but this I can do.

95
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.713
You okay?

96
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.757
I saw him.

97
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.274
I saw your dad in... in an office

98
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.953
sketching something
in a notebook.

99
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.759
I couldn't quite
make out what it was.

100
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.433
Did you see anything else?

101
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.639
Um. equations
on a chalkboard.

102
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.216
We didn't have a chalkboard
in our home office.

103
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.072
No. but tell us everything
that you saw.

104
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.496
What's on the walls. what's on
the desk. what he was wearing.

105
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.520
Leave nothing out.

106
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.115
He had an ID.
It was. like. a yellow logo.

107
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.793
like a yellow state building.

108
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.475
Yellow logo. so.
not a state building.

109
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.472
A university building.

110
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.280
Hudson University.

111
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.591
Professor Stein.
And did you know him?

112
00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.796
I knew he admired him.

113
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.951
but I didn't realize
that they were friends.

114
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.077
Add that to the growing list
of secrets.

115
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.038
All right.
Let's go. giraffe.

116
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.200
Thank you.

117
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.680
It's what I do.

118
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.240
<i>Natalie. come here. I have
a pre-wedding surprise for you.</i>

119
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.559
Flawless Asscher cut diamonds
set in platinum.

120
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.518
Over 383 karats.

121
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.319
My great grandfather gave this
to his wife

122
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.470
on their wedding day.

123
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.119
Tomorrow. it's yours.

124
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.874
Tomorrow?
That's torture.

125
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.951
Stop!

126
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.191
Mazel Tov.

127
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.279
Can you describe the man
that you saw?

128
00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.558
I'd barely call him a man.
the way he moved.

129
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.519
And when he looked back at me.

130
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.875
it was terrifying.

131
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.111
- Could you see his face?
- No.

132
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.112
He was wearing
some sort of clown mask.

133
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.496
And you're sure the necklace

134
00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.840
<i>is the only thing
that was stolen.</i>

135
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.440
Yes. and it's irreplaceable.

136
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.558
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

137
00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.918
Hey.
A nice surprise.

138
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.640
Yeah. well. a million dollar
jewelry theft is still news

139
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.074
even in Central City. so.

140
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.320
So. you're off the metas.
huh?

141
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.635
Yeah. no. not today.

142
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.496
You know. I think I'm just
gonna follow up on this

143
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.874
while it's still fresh.

144
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.616
- I'll see you tonight. okay?
- Okay. wait. Hang on.

145
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.711
I mean. we're working
on the same case.

146
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.431
Why don't we pool resources.
maybe solve this one together.

147
00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.318
Yeah. I don't know. Barry.
it's just...

148
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.756
Come on. grab some Big Belly
on the way to S.T.A.R. Labs.

149
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.712
It'll be like a date.

150
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.514
- All right.
- All right. Come on.

151
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.914
<i>This is the life.</i>

152
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.276
Seriously.
I could stay here forever.

153
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.874
No worries.
no schrap from Mom...

154
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.235
Wait. wait. wait.
what was that?

155
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.755
- Schrap.
- Schrap?

156
00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.196
Schrap. You know. like all
the nagging that mom does.

157
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.237
I mean.
she acts like she supports me.

158
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.352
but what she really
wants is a boring.

159
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.909
quiet daughter who just wants
to stay inside all day

160
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.320
instead of go out
and do anything

161
00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.776
that might be
the least bit dangerous.

162
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.838
Nora. this is the West house.

163
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.560
In it. every West
is given respect.

164
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.394
most especially your mother.

165
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.156
I am sure she raised you
as best she could.

166
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.596
She raised me to be afraid
of the world.

167
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.195
But I'm a hero.
you know. like Dad.

168
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.396
And we have to keep moving

169
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.756
until everyone
that needs us is safe.

170
00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.309
Okay.

171
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.392
I'm sorry. what is this for?

172
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.756
When Papa Joe comes back.
this table

173
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.638
is going to
finally be built.

174
00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.591
You wanted to keep moving.

175
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.639
- Oh. do I have to?
- Yes.

176
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.279
All right. I'll make you
a deal.

177
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.919
For every chore you do

178
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.913
I'll tell you one thing Papa
Joe told me about your father

179
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.277
that didn't make it into
the precious Flash museum.

180
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.477
Oh. Mama Cecile.
the museum has

181
00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.376
a complete record of
all of Dad's accomplishments.

182
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.496
Including the time Barry
ended up in an alternate past

183
00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.115
filled with golden giants
called "Grodans"?

184
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.429
Wait. what?

185
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.520
Grodans.

186
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.431
Done.
So then what happened?

187
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.830
Not done.
Wait for it.

188
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.192
Huh.

189
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.555
<i>Yeah.</i>

190
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.435
<i>So. why exactly
does Caitlin have a key</i>

191
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.874
to Professor Stein's
old office?

192
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.475
Clarissa gave me a key.
She didn't realize that Martin

193
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.711
and my father knew
each other either.

194
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.393
I wonder
what he was doing in here.

195
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.676
Well. perhaps Mr. Ramon
could vibe the chalkboard

196
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.989
and we could see
for ourselves.

197
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.753
What do you think?

198
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.319
What did you see?

199
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.754
Hydrogen chains bonded
over and over.

200
00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:00.119
Two oxygen
at absolute zero.

201
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.919
It's like it's
making heavy water.

202
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.720
Not heavy water.

203
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.234
Ice.

204
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.755
Another one of my father's
hidden messages?

205
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.436
Ah.

206
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.429
<i>"Khione"?</i>

207
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.637
What kind of a message
is "Khione"?

208
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.995
A clear one.

209
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.720
At least to me.
Look. monsieur Ramon.

210
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.952
you said that earlier that
you could see that Dr. Snow.

211
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.872
her father sketching
something. right?

212
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.634
That sketch that you could
almost make out...

213
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.469
Did it look
a little something like this?

214
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.392
Good lord.
are you a speedster?

215
00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.359
Speed sketcher.
It's a modest talent.

216
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.954
My father was drawing me?

217
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.590
Not you.
Khione.

218
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.399
Khione. a Greek goddess.

219
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:56.157
Child of the North Wind.
whose realm was ice and snow.

220
00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.357
Khione.

221
00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.920
Killer Frost.

222
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.816
<i>That means that whatever
Thomas was doing.</i>

223
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.593
he knew that there
were two of you.

224
00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.961
<i>Also. it stands to
reason that Thomas was there</i>

225
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.992
at the point of creation
of Killer Frost.

226
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.800
So. he knew the truth
about Killer Frost?

227
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.197
He knew who I really am?

228
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.634
Right.

229
00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.200
- Did I scare him away?
- No. this wasn't your fault.

230
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.720
Look. I don't know why he left.
but it wasn't because of you.

231
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.200
and we're gonna prove that.

232
00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.399
You okay?

233
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.676
Yeah. just lost my footing
there for a second.

234
00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.399
- What...
- What did you see?

235
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.919
You guys ever hear
of Viera Chemicals?

236
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.276
Oh. it's an old chem lab
out in the Barrens.

237
00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.158
but it's been shut down
for years.

238
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.436
Well.
what are we waiting for?

239
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.976
You know. it's been great
seeing you out there again.

240
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.878
doing what you love.

241
00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:21.277
Yeah. I guess some girls grow
up wanting to be Supergirl.

242
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:26.799
I always wanted to be Soledad
O'Brien or Christiane Amanpour.

243
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.395
So yeah.
it's really great to reconnect.

244
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.549
That's weird.
It says the hair I found

245
00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.360
is human
but it can't pull any DNA.

246
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.955
- Maybe run it again?
- Yeah.

247
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.433
Come on. Novick.

248
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.672
You wanna improve
Gotham City's skyline.

249
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.035
you do it with a building

250
00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.555
nobody can take
their eyes off of.

251
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.632
That's one of mine.

252
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.474
You go with me.
I'll design you a building

253
00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.712
that makes the Burj Khalifa
look like a strip mall.

254
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.315
Architecture
means everything to me.

255
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.720
I mean. you tell me.

256
00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.797
How many other architects
have won

257
00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.840
the Pritzker Prize three times?

258
00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.274
Good choice.

259
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.793
<i>Where did you get this?</i>

260
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.633
By some really weird markings

261
00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.200
at the bottom
of a large gift box

262
00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.398
that I'm pretty sure
was opened from the inside.

263
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.136
Okay. you know
you're opening all of our mail

264
00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.160
from now on. right?

265
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.519
Somebody called in a bomb
threat at Seaver Architects.

266
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.269
- What happened?
- That thing. it did this.

267
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.037
Flash.

268
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:05.311
That thing destroyed
my life's work.

269
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.750
So. he squeezed his way

270
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.120
through
an air conditioning vent?

271
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.272
Yeah. he could stretch
kinda like Ralph.

272
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.400
except he was wearing a...

273
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.755
- Clown mask.
- Yup.

274
00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.072
Just like the guy that stole
the Winehouse necklace.

275
00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.959
Mm-hmm.
We got a stretching clown meta.

276
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.918
Yeah.
that's not creepy at all.

277
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.195
Yeah.

278
00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.960
Did you find any more
of those weird lines?

279
00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.032
No. and if there's more.
they're buried underneath

280
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.356
tons of rubble. just like
our meta. unless he was able

281
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.840
to stretch out
of that one too.

282
00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:07.039
Which... I'm sure he was.

283
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.918
- The lines.
- What?

284
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.311
Well. I mean. our meta can
stretch and contort. right?

285
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.232
<i>What if his fingerprints
can too?</i>

286
00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.040
Got him.
Peter Merkel.

287
00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.077
And he was arrested
for B&E two years ago.

288
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.120
Wait. Peter Merkel. the son
of billionaire Theresa Merkel?

289
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.510
Yup.

290
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.576
How does someone go from being
a member of high society

291
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.069
to stealing heirlooms
and blowing up buildings?

292
00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.038
Maybe we should attend
this gala she's hosting

293
00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.349
and ask her ourselves.

294
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.511
Uh. I don't know.
what if Merkel's there?

295
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.720
So what?
We'll come prepared.

296
00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.120
Some meta handcuffs for me.

297
00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.795
a taser for you.
and we get to dress up.

298
00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.880
- Barry.
- What?

299
00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.077
This is a meta investigation;
this is not date night.

300
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.391
I'm just saying.
I look really good in a tux.

301
00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.832
When did this happen?

302
00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.798
The night your father
disappeared.

303
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.280
Oh.

304
00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.398
Well. well. well.
Liquid nitrogen.

305
00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.312
That's a potent accelerant.
is it not?

306
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.199
Oh. this place.
it would have gone up. Whoa.

307
00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.556
So. all my father's work
is completely gone?

308
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.757
Well. not necessarily.

309
00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.638
I mean. think about it.

310
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.176
Police listed this fire as
accidental.

311
00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.776
but they didn't know
about the connection

312
00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.519
to Caitlin's father. so...

313
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.513
Ralph. my father told me
to come find him.

314
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.957
Yeah. no. I know that.
but a guy who disappears

315
00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.073
on the night of a warehouse
fire and who's hard to find?

316
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.277
Well. if you think this was
arson. let me tell you.

317
00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.256
if her father did this. well.
he would need a lot of help

318
00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.670
covering his tracks. right?

319
00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.355
Yeah.
Maybe he got it.

320
00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.776
<i>Listen. my mom may not
be the best person.</i>

321
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.076
but there's no way she'd be
party to something like this.

322
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.674
There's one way to find out.

323
00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.816
What. you want to question
the mother again?

324
00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.296
You already did that.
and what did you get? Nothing.

325
00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.198
Well it's a clue.
Surely. we should follow it.

326
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.536
You already know
that this is still

327
00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.240
Tannhauser facility. okay?
So you're wrong.

328
00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.470
Oh. I'm wrong? I'm wrong?

329
00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.776
I'm the one who figured out
Cicada's mask.

330
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.519
You couldn't figure that out.

331
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.456
You said you wouldn't doubt me.
that was your mistake.

332
00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.676
Enough. yeah. enough!
Just give me this.

333
00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.799
<i>Cisco?</i>

334
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.513
Cisco?

335
00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.393
You look amazing. by the way.
Thank you.

336
00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.479
There's Theresa Merkel.
Come on.

337
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:44.736
Wait. What are we going
to say?

338
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.150
We can't just ask her if
her son was recently hit

339
00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.754
by dark matter into shrapnel.

340
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.559
You'll think of something.
Me?

341
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.439
So sorry.

342
00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.035
Hi. Mrs. Merkel.
I'm Iris West Allen.

343
00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.918
Oh. I know who you are.

344
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.912
Don't you usually
write about lunatics

345
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.993
and the heroes
who catch them?

346
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.719
Well. you know.
supporting the arts

347
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.678
is a citywide concern.

348
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.036
- Hmm.
- I'm Barry Allen.

349
00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.272
Ah. And you're obviously not
here to make a sizeable

350
00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.194
donation which means you.
my dear.

351
00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.919
are here on assignment.

352
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.392
All right. ask whatever you
like. You have two minutes.

353
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.676
Well.
it's about your son. Peter.

354
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.558
When was the last time
that you saw him?

355
00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.438
That would be two years ago

356
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.194
when he broke
into his own house.

357
00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:37.194
I was out of town.
and my staff had him arrested.

358
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.760
Do you know
where Peter is now?

359
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.553
No. and I don't care.

360
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.519
See.
I gave him the world.

361
00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.479
The finest private schools.
his own wing to play in.

362
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.110
But he just
never appreciated it.

363
00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.040
Enjoy the party.

364
00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.236
I feel kinda bad for him now.

365
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.159
She's so cold.

366
00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.839
Can you imagine
what that was like?

367
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.830
Hey. you know what?

368
00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.559
It's not a date
without a dance.

369
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.950
Barry. wait.
I mean. this is work. right?

370
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.869
We just hit a dead end. so.
why don't we just go home?

371
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.515
Hey. hey.

372
00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.990
Just one dance. all right?

373
00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.034
Okay.

374
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.550
You know. we never really
had our first dance.

375
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.675
Yeah. this is really nice.

376
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.037
Excuse me for a second.

377
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.839
Hey. You okay?

378
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.510
She gave her only son
everything that she had

379
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.320
and it wasn't enough.

380
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.074
Just like I'm not enough
for Nora.

381
00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.073
You are nothing
like that woman in there.

382
00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.595
You're sure. Barry?

383
00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.936
I mean. I love our daughter
with all my heart.

384
00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.633
but she hates me.

385
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.951
Because I turn my back on her

386
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.953
just like Theresa Merkel
did to her son.

387
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.999
I lie to her
about everything that she is.

388
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.790
And I prevent her from living
the life that she deserves.

389
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.754
- I'd hate me too.
- Iris.

390
00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.799
You are never going to be
the person that Nora knows

391
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.109
from the future.

392
00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.476
That's the thing.
It's not even up to us.

393
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.390
I've already become her

394
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.437
and I didn't even
have a choice.

395
00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.234
<i>While you were unconscious.</i>

396
00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.312
I scanned your wounds.

397
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.995
There are still trace amounts
of aluminum-beryllium alloy

398
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.434
fused within your hands.

399
00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.776
It's remnants
from Cicada's dagger.

400
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.359
See. this is... this
is what I need.

401
00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.440
I just need rest.

402
00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.955
No. Cisco. rest is not
going to fix this. okay?

403
00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.236
Every time you vibe or breach.
the dark matter

404
00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.936
is going to affect
your central nervous system.

405
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.679
causing you more and more pain.

406
00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.595
Wait... which you must have been
experiencing all day today.

407
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.080
Why didn't you say anything?

408
00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.676
Because you're my friend
and you needed my help.

409
00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.229
Okay. but I would never ask
you to hurt yourself.

410
00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.879
Every time you vibe

411
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.917
you are going to have
more and more seizures.

412
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.357
Then what am I
supposed to do?

413
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.196
I remember when these powers
were a curse.

414
00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.879
Seeing Thawne kill me
over and over.

415
00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.600
Knowing that darkness.

416
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.112
I didn't want that.

417
00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.875
I didn't want to be a hero.

418
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:45.159
These powers were a part of me.
I had to learn that.

419
00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.995
And when I did.
they showed me everything.

420
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.039
I could vibe every clue.

421
00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.032
I could breach us
wherever we needed to go.

422
00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.112
I could bring my value
to the team.

423
00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.152
If I can't take the pain.
that means Cicada wins.

424
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.709
No.
Hey.

425
00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.554
Listen. I get it. okay?

426
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.554
When DeVoe took away
Killer Frost. I was destroyed.

427
00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.160
But you know what?

428
00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.556
I'm still here.

429
00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.280
And so are you.

430
00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.434
Because you are Cisco Ramon.

431
00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.273
Genius engineer.

432
00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.431
prodigy hacker.

433
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.477
and the mechanic
who built a cold gun

434
00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.598
that could stop
a speedster.

435
00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.799
And you're my friend.

436
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.271
You're my friend who went out
there and hurt himself today.

437
00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.910
Just to help me try
and find my dad.

438
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.595
And that wasn't Vibe.

439
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.558
That was Cisco.

440
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.677
and that's the guy I need.

441
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.798
That cold gun
was pretty amazing.

442
00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.317
It was stolen
almost immediately...

443
00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.756
Oh. immediately.

444
00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.513
But yeah.
it was pretty great.

445
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.599
You know. this case
will keep until morning.

446
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.674
Yeah. I know. it's just
Merkel's still out there.

447
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.336
And the gala was a dead end
and all we know

448
00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.353
is that he committed two
completely unrelated crimes.

449
00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.317
I don't know what to do
about Nora. Barry.

450
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.436
Yeah.

451
00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.558
Well. look. I mean. you know
I'm on your side with this.

452
00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.518
If you dampen her powers
in the future.

453
00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.776
it's because
you care about her.

454
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.154
You're doing it
to keep her safe.

455
00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.670
Yeah.
Just because I can protect her

456
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.956
doesn't mean
that I'm a good mom.

457
00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:50.280
This isn't like
what happened with Francine.

458
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.956
Isn't it?

459
00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:02.076
She left me and my dad kept it
a secret all to protect me.

460
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.197
And when she came back.
I pushed her away.

461
00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.517
I barely had a chance
to know her before she...

462
00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.197
I lost my chance to connect
with my mom and...

463
00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.074
Now when I get older. Nora is
going to push me away too.

464
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.078
That's not gonna happen.

465
00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.669
Well. it sure seems to be
going in that direction.

466
00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.797
Then choose
a different route.

467
00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.236
Make a different choice
when you raise Nora.

468
00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.154
If you don't want to be that
person. don't be that person.

469
00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.160
It's not that simple.
Barry.

470
00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.273
You're not your mom.

471
00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.238
You're not Iris
from the future.

472
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.551
and you don't have to be. ever.

473
00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.113
I think
you should stop worrying

474
00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.955
about who you might become

475
00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.953
and reconnect with who you are.
now.

476
00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.109
Yeah.

477
00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.153
Now. let's go home.
all right?

478
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.557
Actually.
can I just meet you there?

479
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.716
I think I have a lead.

480
00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.591
Okay.

481
00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.754
Shut up.
Dad did not keep singing.

482
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.559
No way was your father
gonna let

483
00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.314
the middle school
production of <i>Guys and Dolls</i>

484
00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.272
turn out to be a disaster.

485
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.393
Okay. um. one more.

486
00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:44.599
So. when your dad was
about ten.

487
00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.674
there was a kid in his class
that lost his folks.

488
00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.673
Kid stopped smiling.
barely spoke.

489
00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.956
And for some reason.
all of the other kids in school

490
00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.599
were being so mean to him.

491
00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:00.471
So. your father had lunch with
this boy

492
00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.155
every single day

493
00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.277
<i>for a whole year.</i>

494
00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.671
And when springtime came
and the yearbook came out

495
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:12.595
your father gave the kid
an entire page

496
00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.956
and the photos
of his science fair project

497
00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.872
made him "most
likely to succeed."

498
00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.351
And then the boy
finally smiled.

499
00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:29.800
Wait. but Dad
wasn't in yearbook.

500
00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.200
That story
wasn't about Dad. was it?

501
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:43.434
It was about Mom helping Dad.

502
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.631
Wait. were all those stories
you told me about Mom?

503
00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.598
Nora. you're projecting
all of these feelings

504
00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:57.152
that you have
about Iris 30 years from now.

505
00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.914
You're not getting to know
who she is today.

506
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.431
These stories that I told you.

507
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.513
they're what made me fall
in love with the Wests.

508
00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.832
Made me realize how special
this family is.

509
00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.479
So...

510
00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:18.914
If you liked them.
plenty more in here.

511
00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:51.760
Hey.

512
00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.797
<i>Hey babe. I just spoke
with Mrs. Merkel.</i>

513
00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.792
<i>I think I know
what Peter wants.</i>

514
00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.473
<i>The jewelry. the building.</i>

515
00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.756
<i>they all meant something
personal to the victim.</i>

516
00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:00.840
<i>He wants to deliver</i>

517
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.555
<i>the most painfully emotional
blow possible.</i>

518
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.359
<i>Just like his family did
to him.</i>

519
00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.239
<i>You... you okay?</i>

520
00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.551
Yeah.

521
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.149
Yeah. sorry. that MO
fits perfectly.

522
00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.720
Who do you think's
his next victim?

523
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.792
Ugh!

524
00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.792
Barry?

525
00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.633
<i>Come and get him.</i>

526
00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.037
Guys. Merkel kidnapped Barry.

527
00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.679
- What?
- How's that even possible?

528
00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.880
He's got Barry's meta-cuffs.

529
00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.998
- Well. that would do it.
- Who are you calling?

530
00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.239
Damn it. Nora. pick up.

531
00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.360
I'll ping Barry's cell.
see if I can get a location.

532
00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.116
He's in Eaglesham apartments
on Simone Ave.

533
00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.616
<i>I don't think he's
in the apartments</i>

534
00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.710
so much as on them.

535
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:51.800
Right.

536
00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:54.395
Okay. guys. We don't have a
speedster. Cisco can't breach.

537
00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.776
and Killer Frost
is out of commission.

538
00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.076
We need to come up with a plan
to rescue Barry now.

539
00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.656
The extrapolator.
We can breach in and grab him.

540
00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.680
Great. where is it?

541
00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.433
Right.

542
00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.955
Uh. about that...

543
00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.240
I broke it.

544
00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.033
How did you break this?
Batting practice?

545
00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.136
- It's not user friendly.
- You're not user friendly!

546
00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.196
Cisco.

547
00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.696
It's going to take me at
least an hour to fix it.

548
00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.336
- Cisco. we don't have an hour.
- Well. I...

549
00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.556
No. but we do have me.

550
00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.713
Let's go save The Flash.

551
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.759
That was inspiring.

552
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:24.840
Yeah.

553
00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.432
- You got a cuff key?
- Thanks.

554
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.275
I'll drive.

555
00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.794
Actually.
I wanna try something.

556
00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.473
Saw it in a comic book.

557
00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.480
Whoo-hoo!

558
00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.438
Whoo!

559
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.638
Ah. you're choking me.
You're choking me.

560
00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.480
Hey. I used to live there.

561
00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.560
Ralph.

562
00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.915
Oh. I got it.

563
00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.759
Police man.

564
00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:42.877
Fancy cuffs.

565
00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.711
Peter.
you don't want to do this.

566
00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:48.632
Look. I know
how you got your abilities.

567
00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.155
The night of the enlightenment.
right?

568
00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.039
You were hit by a piece of
the satellite. weren't you?

569
00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.554
Crushed!

570
00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.472
Snapped.

571
00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:00.394
Broken.

572
00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.472
Okay. well. I know people
who can help you.

573
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.592
People who could stop
your suffering.

574
00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:14.355
Suffering can't be stopped.

575
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:18.878
Especially hers.

576
00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.838
If you touch Iris...

577
00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.594
Don't want to hear your pain.

578
00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:26.149
Only your wife's.

579
00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.555
Let him go.

580
00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.552
The wife.

581
00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:37.395
You fire. he dies.

582
00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.313
Okay.

583
00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.113
Okay.

584
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.034
Just don't hurt him.

585
00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.480
Hey Caitlin. what's up?

586
00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.476
You heard the lady.
Raggedy Dandy.

587
00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.710
Let him go.

588
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.315
Okay.

589
00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.632
Barry!

590
00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:29.032
Mom. Holy schrap.

591
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.999
You just threw yourself off
a building to save Dad?

592
00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:35.232
- Yeah.
- That was beyond schway.

593
00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.113
You're crazy.
I am.

594
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.477
- Thank you. I love you.
- I love you.

595
00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.391
Oh. my God.
Ralph is still up there.

596
00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.120
I hope I don't land
on my keys!

597
00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.475
Ah.

598
00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.393
Uh.

599
00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.231
You guys
still have those meta-cuffs?

600
00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.633
Iris West Allen. I know
badassery when I see it

601
00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.951
and that was raw. unrefined.
cage-free.

602
00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.111
non-GMO badassery right there.

603
00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.840
- You dove off a building.
- For me.

604
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.479
Yeah. I guess I kinda did.

605
00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.279
What was going
through your mind?

606
00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.195
"Uh. please. God.
don't let me drop this key."

607
00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:30.352
I mean. weren't you afraid?
You're not a speedster.

608
00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.432
No. I'm not.

609
00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:36.912
But my husband and my partner
and my best friend is.

610
00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.998
Well. not to interrupt
this wonderful moment

611
00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:43.278
that I just interrupted. but.
you know. I helped defeat

612
00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.113
- that boneless bozo too.
- Mm-hmm.

613
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:48.955
It wasn't so easy.
And that... God. that mask.

614
00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.997
It's like one of those
porcelain dolls

615
00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:55.313
that's gonna
kill you while you sleep.

616
00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.675
I thought it was more like
a ragdoll.

617
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.116
Yeah. that's right.
Still got it.

618
00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.197
Hold your applause.

619
00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.336
Guess it's off
to Iron Heights

620
00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.795
for slippery old Rag Doll.

621
00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.156
Oh. wait. you're... you're
leaving?

622
00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.038
Yeah. um.
there's something I need to do.

623
00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.476
but I'll be right back.
I promise.

624
00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.272
She looks happy.

625
00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:22.320
Yeah. she really does.

626
00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.355
I do that too.

627
00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.715
Oh.

628
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.395
I was writing
about what you did tonight.

629
00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.914
It was awesome.

630
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.434
Thanks.

631
00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.591
I guess
it kinda runs in the family.

632
00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.758
- Where did you get that?
- Oh.

633
00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.714
Dad's always adding to it.
It's so silly.

634
00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.111
No. it's not. It's your life.

635
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.955
I mean. editor
of the school paper by age 11.

636
00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.750
Exposing a corrupt school
teacher at the age of 15.

637
00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.480
I mean. you never talk
about this stuff.

638
00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.592
In the... the future. I mean.

639
00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:20.072
It's. um. one of your
off-limits topics.

640
00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.197
I'm not allowed
to ask about it.

641
00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.349
Look.

642
00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.000
Nora.

643
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.274
I am not that person
in the future.

644
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.438
And nothing
is off limits to me. okay?

645
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.991
I'm not gonna sit
behind a desk and say "no."

646
00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:48.640
I want you to live your life.

647
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.752
And...

648
00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.875
I want you to be
a part of mine.

649
00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:59.510
No secrets. no lies. just...

650
00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.671
Us being who we are today.

651
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:07.075
- Really?
- Yeah. really.

652
00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.200
Did you really stake out the
girls' bathroom in third grade

653
00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:19.478
to prove that the school
janitor wasn't cleaning it?

654
00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.711
I'm gonna kill Cecile.

655
00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.280
<i>But. um. yes.</i>

656
00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.034
<i>I was a real-life Nancy Drew
back then.</i>

657
00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:29.113
Wow. That's cool. Mom.

658
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.200
Um. is it?

659
00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.919
<i>Shirley and I were talking.</i>

660
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.416
and while we realize our styles
are very different.

661
00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.440
what we both like...

662
00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:38.755
Is a good mystery.

663
00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:39.936
So we put our heads together.

664
00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.496
And after some
intellectual hair pulling.

665
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.399
we realized that if your mom
wasn't lying...

666
00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.870
And Tannhauser was still
somehow involved...

667
00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.800
There's only one sure place
somebody could hide

668
00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.315
without anyone
knowing about it.

669
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.153
A Tannhauser black ops site.

670
00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.356
There you go.

671
00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.616
I mean.
they've got dozens of them.

672
00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:58.200
They were safe houses to test
dangerous pathogens for the CDC

673
00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.840
but Mom hasn't taken
a government job in years.

674
00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.838
They'd all be shut down.

675
00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:06.351
Yeah. that's why it's
the best place to hide.

676
00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.954
Okay. so how do we find them?

677
00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:10.919
Without Sally?
Uh. have you tried Google?

678
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.037
Yes.
We just use their satellite.

679
00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.080
I don't think we can use
someone else's satellite.

680
00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.640
Or maybe we can.

681
00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.799
When DeVoe took over Sally.
he also launched four

682
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.236
of his own satellites to bring
about the enlightenment.

683
00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:30.400
but now that he's gone
maybe we can work around the...

684
00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.676
Multiplexed
burst-model channels

685
00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.592
and the inter-SV handoff.

686
00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.151
We've got eyes and ears.

687
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.754
We've got eyes and ears!

688
00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.234
- I knew you could do it.
- Ah!

689
00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.232
- Oh. sorry.
- That was dumb.

690
00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:56.839
Ladies and gentlemen.
may I introduce you to...

691
00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:03.315
HAL. Robbie. Data.
and Colossus.

692
00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.638
I don't really like
those names.

693
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.473
But nonetheless.
those can help us

694
00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.870
in tracking the shards
from the satellite?

695
00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.960
These babies can help with
anything and everything.

696
00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.096
<i>Well. once we figure out
which one hit Cicada.</i>

697
00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.800
we can figure out
how he got his abilities.

698
00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.240
maybe find some
kind of a weakness.

699
00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:21.631
So. what we are waiting for?

700
00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:29.630
Caitlin?
Do you know what this means?

701
00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.633
We can locate your father.

702
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.400
Wait. wait.
I. uh...

703
00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.074
Isn't this what you wanted?

704
00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.117
It is. I just...

705
00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.517
Okay.

706
00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:53.355
When you're ready.

707
00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.669
Thanks.

708
00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.874
<i>Greg. move your head.</i>
