<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.496
My time on this earth
is coming to an end.

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.751
<i>You're part of something
different now.</i>

4
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.551
Part of a negative force.
Pain racing through your mind.

5
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.074
Thawne really got her.

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.429
<i>Her lightning. It was red.</i>

7
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.034
Renee Adler.
Sherloque Wells.

8
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.194
You're a meta.

9
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.953
You're from the future.

10
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.231
- The mission can succeed.
- What mission?

11
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.232
<i>To kill every last
meta-human.</i>

12
00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:28.516
Cicada's dagger
can dampen powers.

13
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.432
If anything's gonna destroy
that dagger.

14
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.749
<i>it's this mirror gun.</i>

15
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.274
Cicada has a lethal virus.

16
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.829
She stole the atomizer
so she could spread the virus.

17
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.436
Cicada is gonna kill every
meta-human in the city.

18
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.990
15 years. Thawne.

19
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.918
Tell me. how's it feel to know
you're about to become extinct?

20
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.437
I guess time will tell.

21
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.877
I'm gonna miss
the hell out of you.

22
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.079
Especially our
rehabilitation time.

23
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.873
How about a taste
of what's to come?

24
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.393
Ironic. isn't it?

25
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.915
The same thing that gives you
your powers

26
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.832
is gonna end you.

27
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.354
It's time.

28
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.873
We need to stop this plague
from spreading.

29
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.192
We will.

30
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.480
We can't just purge
the meta-humans in this city.

31
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.519
We need to wipe
every one of them

32
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.195
off the face of the planet.

33
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.316
We will.

34
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.398
You need to promise me
this will work. Gracie.

35
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.711
I said it will.

36
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.478
It's time we finish this.
Gracie.

37
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.556
It's time to ensure our legacy.

38
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.231
Here's what we know
about the cryoatomizer.

39
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.118
Tannhauser originally
developed it

40
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.715
to combat land fires
caused by droughts.

41
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.996
So the cryoatomizer can
disperse cold air particles

42
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.197
into the atmosphere
that triggers rainfall.

43
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.591
However. if Cicada can replace
the cold particles

44
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.593
with the cure prototype
she stole from Cisco...

45
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.354
Which doesn't cure
so much as it kills.

46
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.955
...she could infect
the entire city.

47
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.713
And every meta-human in it.

48
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.719
Not great. but this dark cloud
does have a silver lining.

49
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.196
which is if Cicada
had everything

50
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.478
that she needs to carry
out her plan...

51
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.119
would've already done so.

52
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.395
He's right.

53
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.790
She must be missing something
or else it'd be done.

54
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.234
Yeah. but not for long.

55
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.595
She's not gonna waste any time.

56
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.856
Whatever it is that she needs.

57
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.553
she's out there
looking for it right now.

58
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.199
Well. then we move
right away.

59
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.000
We get the cure to everyone who
needs it as soon as possible.

60
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.914
So we just up and release
some game-changing wonder drug?

61
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.640
We tested it.
We know it works.

62
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.554
People need a choice
now more than ever.

63
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.235
Do we have enough of the cure?

64
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.595
Not nearly enough.

65
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.273
Caitlin. how fast can
you make more?

66
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.680
Guess we'll find out.

67
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.558
Okay. okay. good.

68
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.599
Now we just need to find
someplace to distribute it.

69
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.553
Well. what about CCPD?

70
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.715
It's public. Everybody
feels safe going there.

71
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.757
Yeah. but gathering
that many metas in one place

72
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.071
is gonna make it
one big target. right?

73
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.152
Cicada has the virus
and the atomizer.

74
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.596
That makes every meta
everywhere a target.

75
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.000
Well. how about this?

76
00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.152
You guys make up as much
of the cure as you can

77
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.576
and Cecile and I
will talk to Singh.

78
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.478
- Yeah.
- All right.

79
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.438
I'm going to warn Renee.

80
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.670
Yeah.

81
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.390
All right.
let's track Cicada too.

82
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.437
Get ready to face her
when we find her.

83
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.273
Let's take it one step
at a time.

84
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.680
Follow me.

85
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.239
- Is that the satellite core?
- That's right.

86
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.039
The reflective panels
on the mirror gun

87
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.000
aren't the only thing
we got from the satellite.

88
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.869
We also have the core and.
of course. the dagger.

89
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.838
So they're all composed

90
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.832
of the exact same alloy
and contain

91
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.877
- the same dark matter levels?
- Yup.

92
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.296
So if the Mirror Gun
works on the core.

93
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.755
then it should work on
Cicada's dagger.

94
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.674
Only one way
to know for sure.

95
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.319
You might wanna step back.

96
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.816
I mean. you don't know
what this gun's gonna do.

97
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.674
I mean. we shouldn't be firing
this in such a small space.

98
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.456
but what's life if you don't
pull down your shorts

99
00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.816
and slide on the ice
every once in a while?

100
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.513
- Here we go!
- Hm.

101
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.560
Um...

102
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.871
Is something supposed
to happen or...

103
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.760
Whoa.

104
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.396
Where did it go?

105
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.557
It doesn't matter.

106
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.960
This thing works.

107
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.918
It works!

108
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.754
We can finally destroy
Cicada's dagger.

109
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.194
If we do that.
we have our powers.

110
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.039
And we can stop her.

111
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.955
N... Nora. are you okay?

112
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.679
Yeah. why?

113
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.674
Nora. earlier today you had
red lightning like Thawne's.

114
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.595
We want to make sure
you're okay to get out there.

115
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.592
I'm fine. okay?

116
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.399
Caitlin ran every test
in the book.

117
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.234
My lightning's back
to its normal color.

118
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.471
And besides.
Thawne's Speed Force

119
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.552
is fueled
by negative emotions.

120
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.593
and right now I feel
pretty dang positive.

121
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.991
Okay. We're your parents.
It's our job to worry.

122
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.232
The only one that should be
worrying is Cicada Il.

123
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.355
You want me to open
the doors to the CCPD

124
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.954
to every meta in this city?

125
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.714
David. these people need
our protection.

126
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.678
And not all metas
are criminals.

127
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.754
You know. some of them are
doctors and students and cops.

128
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.753
I know. but this is a police station.
not a clinic.

129
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.400
S.T.A.R. Labs says that
the cure is safe

130
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.000
and it's as easy to give
as a flu shot.

131
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.640
Well. S.T.A.R. Labs
isn't exactly the FDA.

132
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.280
Look. we have to do it here.

133
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.512
Red tape alone. it would take
weeks at a medical facility.

134
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.354
If we do nothing. there's
a whole bunch of citizens

135
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.875
who could've been saved
that will die on our watch.

136
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.155
I'm not having that.

137
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.760
Well. you clearly believe
in this.

138
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.833
So I'm willing to as well.

139
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.480
But that means
there's going to be

140
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.631
a lot of
political navigating.

141
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.713
So I'll go down to city hall
and brief them in the morning.

142
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.634
While I'm away.
you're in charge.

143
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.478
Oh!

144
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.120
Sherloque.
you scared me to death.

145
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.112
Well. I apologize.

146
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.159
But when you don't answer
my many emoticon pictograms.

147
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.391
no. I fear the worst. huh?

148
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.110
I was in the library.
What could've happened to me?

149
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.556
Stacks collapse.
Livid librarian.

150
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.518
- Really?
- Death by Dewey Decimals?

151
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.000
Yeah. life lost by late fees?

152
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.958
- Ha-ha! There you go.
- Yeah. Oh.

153
00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.360
Shall we?

154
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.671
I'm sorry I didn't...
I didn't check my texts.

155
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.056
I mean. well. actually
I haven't checked

156
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.309
my phone all day. so...

157
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.516
And yet the average person

158
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.195
checks their phone
110 times a day.

159
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.476
- That's not true.
- That is true. Look it up.

160
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.394
Well. also the library's
right next to the tech lab.

161
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.836
So. you know. I get
terrible reception in there.

162
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.216
And yet they built
a cell phone tower

163
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.118
less than a mile away.

164
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.112
Hasn't made a difference.

165
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.556
I don't know.
Maybe my phone's just crap.

166
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.916
Or maybe you don't want
to respond

167
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.516
because then you would have
to discuss your secret.

168
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.796
- My secret?
- Yes. your secret.

169
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.719
Run. Run!

170
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.314
What?

171
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.550
It's Sherloque.
Cicada's at CCU.

172
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.594
So at Jitters. I saw you open
the door without touching it.

173
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.479
I know you have powers.
What are they?

174
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.800
That.

175
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.391
I see you too.

176
00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.360
Are you okay?

177
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.079
I think so.

178
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.840
Nora.

179
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.720
Hey. you find anything?

180
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.712
Confirmation that She-cada

181
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.439
hasn't stolen everything
she needs.

182
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.520
So we have some time.

183
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.671
Finally some good news.

184
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.515
Except what she did steal
was a Quantum Tunnel Converter.

185
00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.434
The first working prototype
of its kind.

186
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.433
Yeah. that's the same face
Cisco made when he heard.

187
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.920
The converter can transform

188
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.037
dark matter energy
to practical energy.

189
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.397
Cicada's gonna use her dagger
to superpower the atomizer.

190
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.432
If she wants to connect it
to the atomizer.

191
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.432
the last piece she'll need
is a hyper-conduit.

192
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.240
and those are pretty hard
to come by. to say the least.

193
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.398
She'll be lucky to locate one
in the CC area at all.

194
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.517
Well. we better
find it first.

195
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.671
We'll get to it.

196
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.719
Thank you.

197
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.235
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.
small sips. huh?

198
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.677
The second she saw me.
she wanted me dead.

199
00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.479
She tried to kill me.
Sherloque.

200
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.914
Because of what you are.

201
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.276
A magna-kinetic meta-human!

202
00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.956
That was something.
your powers. huh?

203
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.953
I wanted to tell you. but...

204
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.633
I didn't know what you'd think.

205
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.713
I... I think...

206
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.759
the world of you.

207
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.674
Nothing is ever going
to change that.

208
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.717
Do you think Cicada's
gonna come back again

209
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.872
to try to find me?
To try again?

210
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.072
Yes.
I don't think she'll stop.

211
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.470
What am I gonna do?

212
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.392
Well. you know what?

213
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.960
I believe I can help you
with that.

214
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.269
Hey.

215
00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.397
- Hey.
- Guys. you okay?

216
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.712
Yeah. uh. I need
to tell you something.

217
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.519
When we were running over here.

218
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.954
I connected to Grace's
mind again.

219
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.236
I could see through her eyes.

220
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.834
Wait. like
the same thing you did

221
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.560
when Cicada attacked
Alice Bolan's birthday party?

222
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.109
Yeah. we must still be
psychically connected

223
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.993
from when I was
in Grace's mindscape.

224
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.675
That's what caused
the red lightning.

225
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.070
The anger that you felt.
it wasn't yours.

226
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.992
It was hers.

227
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.639
We can use this.

228
00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.110
If I can see where she is
just for a second.

229
00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.759
we can run to her.

230
00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.271
Guy. this is the key
to stopping Cicada Il.

231
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.033
No.

232
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.112
No. Nora. it's too dangerous.

233
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.714
We don't even know

234
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.936
- what the side effects are.
- No.

235
00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.176
We just got the stuff
out of you.

236
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.431
We're not risking
exposing you to that again.

237
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.119
Mom. I want to do this.

238
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.635
We'll find another way.

239
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.200
We'll find
another way.

240
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.512
The dizziness
should subside shortly.

241
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.398
Make sure he gets lots of rest.

242
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.676
Hey. we know
you're feeling anxious.

243
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.399
But I promise you're safe now.

244
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.800
Head out that way.

245
00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.678
I'm gonna go see
if there's anyone else.

246
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.797
Should we reopen
the Cicada tip line?

247
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.256
And Dupree's asking where you
want the security checkpoints.

248
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.794
Uh. yeah.

249
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.671
Uh. yes. Open it and. uh.
checkpoints should be

250
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.355
two blocks on either side
of the CCPD.

251
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.760
Okay.

252
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.277
Uh. actually.
three... three blocks.

253
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.589
Hey. you. You good?

254
00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.639
Yeah. yeah. I'm good.
Look.

255
00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.677
They're airing
Iris' story again.

256
00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.513
<i>New updates
on the meta-human</i>

257
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.240
<i>serial killer Cicada.

258
00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.879
<i>Central City University.</i>

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.679
<i>Now in response

260
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.071
<i>The Central City Citizen

261
00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.231
<i>in conjunction

262
00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.279

263
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.079
<i>entirely free of cost.</i>

264
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.870
Maybe I should call
the night shift in earlier.

265
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.792
Oh. my God.

266
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.314
Or not.

267
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:33.429
Joe. I just felt
a huge wave of panic.

268
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.075
We're about to get
slammed in here.

269
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.756
Everyone. please be patient.
We'll get to you.

270
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.990
Far enough.

271
00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.349
Okay.

272
00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.750
Stagg. Mercury. Ivo.

273
00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.160
None of them have
a hyper-conduit

274
00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.755
compatible with
the converter Cicada stole.

275
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.536
You know. now that
I've actually experienced

276
00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.720
this whole time travel thing.

277
00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.592
I think I understand it
a little bit better.

278
00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.639
Which makes me understand
Thawne's plan less and less.

279
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.831
Why would he send Nora back
to create a new Cicada

280
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.071
only for a newer Cicada
to appear who's harder to stop

281
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.674
than the one Nora created?

282
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.877
Ralph. can we get away
from Thawne's plan

283
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.553
and try to stick to our own?

284
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.074
Yeah. yeah. I... I just...

285
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.799
I feel like there might be
an answer

286
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.679
in this timey-wimey crap
that could help us solve this.

287
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.514
Nora. where would you find
this hyper-conduit in 2049?

288
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.831
Probably Ollins Laboratory.

289
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.435
Ollins won a Nobel Prize
for quantum engineering.

290
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.795
Ollins?

291
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.270
As in Sebastian Ollins?

292
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.158
Yeah. do you know him?

293
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.197
He's a true genius.

294
00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.391
A genius. you say.

295
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.358
The guy couldn't even
stay awake

296
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.477
through a single
physics lecture.

297
00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.918
In fact. I'm pretty sure if
it wasn't for his very smart.

298
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.435
very considerate
college roommate

299
00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.751
lending him notes.
helping him study.

300
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.560
he wouldn't have made
it through his finals!

301
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.950
Nobel Prize my ass!

302
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.952
Yeah. he knows him.

303
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.680
You know what?
It doesn't even matter.

304
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.514
Life's too short.
and I'm not about to spend my life

305
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.274
worrying about
little Sebastian Ollins.

306
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.510
Found him.

307
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.592
Looks like he's been renting
a warehouse

308
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.273
somewhere on the Southside.

309
00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.512
and then he retrofitted it
with fiber-joules technology

310
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.114
to test out his experiments.

311
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.671
Including one bleeding-edge
hyper-conduit.

312
00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.956
I'll go get it
before Grace can.

313
00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.952
- Right behind you.
- I. um...

314
00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.714
I... I think you should sit
this one out.

315
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.439
What? Why?

316
00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.637
Nora. your connection
with Grace.

317
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.960
It puts you in too much danger.

318
00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.236
I mean. we don't...
I think it's best for you

319
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.074
to just stay out of the field
until we stop her.

320
00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.117
So what? Now I can't help
the team at all?

321
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.271
Nora. please understand.

322
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.312
Look. you would be
much safer here.

323
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.037
All right. I'm here.

324
00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.237
No sign of Cicada.

325
00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.277
Great. Grab the conduit
and get out of there.

326
00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.991
I think I got something.

327
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.480
Barry!

328
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.438
She's already got
the conduit.

329
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.716
<i>And she blew up Ollins'
warehouse.</i>

330
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.877
Grace has everything she needs.

331
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.277
It's just like we thought.

332
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.397
Great.

333
00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.834
What?

334
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.359
With all the pieces
that she's stolen.

335
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.397
Grace can now use the dagger's
dark matter energy

336
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.949
to supercharge the atomizer.

337
00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.157
Apparently it wasn't enough
for her

338
00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.776
to just kill all the metas
in Central City.

339
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.314
With this super-charge.

340
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.313
she'll kill every meta
in the country.

341
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.516
All right. look.

342
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.616
I know you guys want me off
this whole Thawne thing.

343
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.016
- but you've got to hear this.
- Ralph.

344
00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.554
No. you've got
to look at this.

345
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.816
- Ralph...
- You've got to hear this.

346
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.296
So just... just give me a second.
all right?

347
00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.039
- All right.
- Please.

348
00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.192
All right. so. this is
the original timeline

349
00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.999
with the original Cicada.
David Hersch.

350
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.640
This is the night of
the Enlightenment.

351
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.240
when Nora interfered
with the satellite.

352
00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.033
giving us our Cicada.
Orlin Dwyer.

353
00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.158
That's also the same night
that Grace goes into a coma.

354
00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.038
This is where it
gets complicated.

355
00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.554
At some point in the future.

356
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.030
Grace wakes up. she becomes
her own full-fledged Cicada.

357
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.440
She goes back in time.

358
00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.318
she kills her Uncle
with his own dagger.

359
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.596
What happens to all the metas
that Dwyer killed?

360
00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.791
Do they get un-killed?

361
00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.896
What about all the metas that
Grace killed in the future?

362
00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.752
What did she kill them with?

363
00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.911
And most importantly.

364
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.959
what happens in the timeline
where Grace never killed Dwyer?

365
00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.271
Something doesn't add up.

366
00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.439
Look. you might be right.

367
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:05.309
But right now. there won't
be any future for any metas

368
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.312
if we don't get rid
of that dagger.

369
00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.790
Now. This is our last chance.

370
00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.679
We have to figure out
how to find Grace.

371
00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.917
Or we lose everyone.

372
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.231
We'll go see what
the satellites can do.

373
00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.357
Maybe we're due for a miracle.

374
00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.519
Hey. come on.

375
00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.872
Hey.

376
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.296
Do you think we made
the right decision

377
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.640
leaving Nora out of this?

378
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.096
I mean. the whole reason
she came back

379
00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.760
was to fight Cicada
in the first place.

380
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.991
We're her parents.
all right?

381
00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:44.030
It's our job to protect her
from harm.

382
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.200
The best way to do that is just
to keep her far away from it.

383
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.551
You worked for Caitlin
and Killer Frost's connection.

384
00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.314
Let's see what you can do
for me and Grace.

385
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.440
What's taking so long?

386
00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.477
Look. how much more cure
do you have left?

387
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.233
Listen. we have plenty.

388
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.710
Please. uh. we will administer
the cure

389
00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.797
as fast as we can. people.
Okay?

390
00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.872
Detective West.
we need additional squads

391
00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.440
to aid the crowd control.

392
00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.239
Uh. yeah. take... take two.

393
00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.711
No... no. no. Take three.
Two. two. two.

394
00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.713
Joe. we need more
alcohol swabs.

395
00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.314
Babe. you okay?

396
00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.096
Hey. oh! Hey. oh!

397
00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.192
- Sherloque?
- So. Dr. Caitlin Snow.

398
00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.676
This is Cecile Horton
and Detective Joe West.

399
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.353
This is my...

400
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.831
this is Mademoiselle
Renee Aldler.

401
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.310
- Hi. Adler.
- Adler. And Renee.

402
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.676
these are the people
that can help you.

403
00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.639
So you can actually
just remove my powers?

404
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.633
We can if you want us to.

405
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.394
And... and this would
be permanent?

406
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.630
Oh. it's permanent. yes.

407
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.576
But better than Cicada
permanently killing you.

408
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.816
- Am I right?
- Tell her. detective.

409
00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.957
- That's right? Right? See?
- Yes.

410
00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.555
Uh. you're feeling nervous.
I can tell.

411
00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.109
But Cicada really
is trying to kill

412
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.634
every meta-human in this city.

413
00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.473
Hey. what's your problem?

414
00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.836
Back off!
I'm standing here.

415
00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.216
Is something wrong
with your eyes?

416
00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.913
They're fine.

417
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.576
Then get out of my way.

418
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.239
All right. all right.
Break it up.

419
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.600
We need to keep this line
moving.

420
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.393
Want us to detain them.
Detective?

421
00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.517
Just give me the cure
and I'll get out of here.

422
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.035
No way! I was here first!
You know that!

423
00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.634
Sir. what should we do?

424
00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.439
Detective. we've got
one squad left.

425
00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.239
Give me the cure
and I'll get out of here.

426
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.831
Enough!

427
00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.956
I need a minute to think.

428
00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.597
I'm so...

429
00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.592
Renee?

430
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.356
There she is. Hey. whoa. whoa!
Hey. hey! Hey. oh!

431
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.673
That was Cecile.

432
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.959
CCPD is flooded with
a lot of really scared people.

433
00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.680
Are there any signs of Grace's
dark matter signature?

434
00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.399
No. Nothing. Not even a...

435
00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.360
Is that her?

436
00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.991
Nora!

437
00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.514
Barry. she can't hear you.

438
00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.597
I don't think
she can see us either.

439
00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.876
Nora! Nora!

440
00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.999
Nora.

441
00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.039
What were you thinking?

442
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.271
Nora. you almost gave
yourself an aneurysm.

443
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.555
I was trying to find Grace.

444
00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.632
Opening yourself up to Grace
and her rage

445
00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.280
also opens you up
to the Negative Speed Force.

446
00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.794
We don't know anything
about it.

447
00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.096
Don't you get
how dangerous that is?

448
00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.120
Yeah. I do.

449
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.760
And I still wanna try.
I have to try.

450
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.309
Nora. you trying almost
destroyed Cisco's workshop

451
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.800
and almost got yourself killed.

452
00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.873
Not to mention. what if
Cicada saw through your eyes?

453
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.758
You could've given away
our location.

454
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.071
No. I made sure there was
nothing in my eye line

455
00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.152
that said S.T.A.R. Labs.
Guys. listen.

456
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.758
I saw Grace. and I almost saw
where she was.

457
00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.456
Right now she is putting
her pieces together

458
00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.630
and when that is done.

459
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.871
thousands if not hundreds
of thousands of people

460
00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.394
are going to die.

461
00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.200
I can't stand around
and do nothing.

462
00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.079
Yes. you can. because that's
what we're telling you to do.

463
00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.109
When I first got here.
I would rush in to fix things.

464
00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.079
and by doing that. I always
ended up making them worse.

465
00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.550
But I am not
that person anymore

466
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.680
because of you.

467
00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.150
You showed me
how to use my powers.

468
00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.471
You taught me how to make
the right choices.

469
00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:31.271
And right now. I am choosing
to face this risk.

470
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.678
Nora. this is
a terrible idea.

471
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.991
I know you feel that way.

472
00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.395
But I don't.

473
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:45.519
I'm an adult capable
of making my own decisions.

474
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.638
I've made up my mind
about this.

475
00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.953
So I am asking you. please.
as my parents.

476
00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.316
stop trying to keep me away
from this danger

477
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.471
and start helping me face it.

478
00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.994
No. no. no. no. no.
Don't worry. I can handle it.

479
00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.400
All right.

480
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.437
- Hey.
- Uh. hey.

481
00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.376
What are you doing?
Those people are overwhelmed.

482
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.516
They don't know what to do.

483
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.717
They need you and you just...
you walked away?

484
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.176
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
It's just...

485
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.016
Okay. did I just catch you
on the phone with Singh

486
00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.776
trying to find out how fast
he was gonna be back?

487
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:30.350
Cecile. I... I... I'm not used to
being in charge

488
00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.353
of all this managerial
and logistic stuff.

489
00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.456
- I'm just not cut out for that.
- What are you talking about?

490
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.039
Babe. I have seen you
take charge

491
00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.952
in the field a million times.

492
00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.096
But that's in the field and
I always knew that I had Singh

493
00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.157
to go to if I had
any problems this way.

494
00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.640
Now everybody's coming to me

495
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.598
and I can't answer
all these questions.

496
00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.991
Joe West.

497
00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:55.233
How many times has Barry.
Iris. Nora.

498
00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.551
even Ralph Dibny come to you?

499
00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:02.237
Specifically come to you to get
answers to their problems?

500
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.073
More times
than I can count.

501
00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.355
Exactly.

502
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.231
And that is because everyone
of them knows

503
00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.754
that when they come to you.

504
00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.117
they're gonna get
an honest answer

505
00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.510
straight from the heart.

506
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:20.714
Babe. that heart of yours.
that is a moral compass.

507
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:24.271
It's one of the many reasons
why I love you.

508
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.233
Right here.

509
00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.232
That's all you need. babe.
Right here.

510
00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.754
As long as you speak
from there.

511
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.834
I promise you. you will never
lead anyone astray.

512
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.350
Hey. oh!

513
00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.113
- Sherloque.
- Yes.

514
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.793
Sherloque.
I'm sorry I ran.

515
00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.156
I was...
Just feeling so overwhelmed.

516
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.756
All I wanted to do...
make you feel safe.

517
00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.520
And then I put you
in a position where you

518
00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.029
feel overwhelmed and not safe.

519
00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.830
But look. we'll go to S.T.A.R. Labs.
quiet and safe.

520
00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.798
We'll administer the cure.
It will be great.

521
00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.473
Look. Sherloque. that's...

522
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.080
That's not why I ran away.

523
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.516
- It's not?
- No.

524
00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.160
I don't wanna take the cure.

525
00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.596
- You don't?
- No.

526
00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.476
I love having my powers.

527
00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.676
You do?

528
00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.638
Y... yes and yes.

529
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.792
is it scary knowing that
there's a killer out there

530
00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.270
that's targeting people
like me. but...

531
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.158
I don't want
to change who I am.

532
00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.720
I don't want to give into fear

533
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.553
just because
there's danger involved.

534
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.199
You know?

535
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.875
I want to live my life
on my terms.

536
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.157
As a meta-human.

537
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.031
No. but you're brave.

538
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.796
I just worry that Cicada
won't stop

539
00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:49.191
until she kills every
meta-human on this...

540
00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.838
on this earth.

541
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.718
There is a way.

542
00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.872
For you to still have your
powers and be free of Cicada.

543
00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.839
- How?
- On a different Earth.

544
00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.673
where'd you be safe.

545
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.275
In your travels in your career
as a librarian.

546
00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.000
have you ever heard of the
theory of the "Multi-verse"?

547
00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.751
So... so this a device
that opens

548
00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.354
- a portal to another world.
- Yes.

549
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.760
- Right.
- Any world I choose?

550
00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.837
Right. You're so smart.
You catch on so quickly.

551
00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.496
You know. some people.
they just don't believe.

552
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.319
Well. a few weeks ago
I saw a giant shark

553
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.198
fighting a giant gorilla
on the 6:00 news.

554
00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.953
- so...
- That's a good point.

555
00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.936
Now look. this Earth that
I'm going to send you to.

556
00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.633
it's... it's my Earth.

557
00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.320
I'll have some friends there
to meet you.

558
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.119
but secret. huh?

559
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.034
This trip. you must not tell anyone.
because if Cicada

560
00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.680
were to find out
there's multiple Earths

561
00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.536
and each one of these Earths
contains meta-humans.

562
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.279
no. they would be
her next target. Hmm?

563
00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.314
- What?
- Come with me.

564
00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.149
No. I must stay.

565
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.072
Knowing Cicada
is a threat to this Earth.

566
00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.039
I must fight
alongside my friends.

567
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.676
You know. Team Flash.
they're like...

568
00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:08.079
They're like a family to me.
but when I am done...

569
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.152
I will come find you.

570
00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.639
You are the woman
I have been waiting for.

571
00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.440
So...

572
00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.591
I know.

573
00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.520
- Okay. you ready?
- Yeah.

574
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.876
All right.

575
00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.239
<i>Allez.</i>

576
00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.752
You were right.

577
00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.832
We taught you
how to be a hero.

578
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.350
So we shouldn't be angry
at you when you act like one.

579
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.960
I know you're just afraid
I'll get hurt.

580
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.320
There's always going
to be danger

581
00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.198
that you're going
to face. Nora.

582
00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.749
And we can't hold your hand
through all of it.

583
00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.513
As much as we want to.

584
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.350
You're our daughter.
but you're not a kid.

585
00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.319
You're right. you are capable
of making your own decisions.

586
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.856
You really think you can
control your connection

587
00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.554
to the Negative Speed Force.
find Grace for us?

588
00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.120
Yeah. I do.

589
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.056
All I need is for you guys
to keep our home safe

590
00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.230
while I do it.

591
00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.039
I think I know how.

592
00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.839
Let's find Cicada.

593
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.349
Man. this thing brings
back memories.

594
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.159
Good ones? Bad ones?

595
00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.674
Thawne ones.

596
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.336
We trapped the Reverse-Flash
in this thing

597
00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.113
before we even knew
he was Thawne.

598
00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.716
But we actually ended up
trapping his Speed Mirage.

599
00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.634
while his real self
just sat there chilling

600
00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.632
in his wheelchair.

601
00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.474
Man. Thawne's plans got plans.

602
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.313
But fear not. true believers.

603
00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.758
The Thawne Trap 2.0 is smaller.
sleeker. and stronger.

604
00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.639
I've gone ahead and sharpened
the inflection points

605
00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.416
to account for your
Negative Speed Force energy.

606
00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.512
so if you go full
<i>Dante's Peak</i> in there.

607
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.353
we'll be safe out here.

608
00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:48.672
It also means I can't phase in there
if you need me.

609
00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.474
Your dad and I will
be right here the whole time.

610
00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.155
You always are.

611
00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.471
You got this.

612
00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.432
Let's go catch our big bad.

613
00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:12.079
Hey!
Excuse me! Excuse me!

614
00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.034
People. please! Please!

615
00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.358
Thank you.

616
00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:22.719
For all of you I haven't met.
I'm Detective Joe West.

617
00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.599
Now. I am not a meta-human.

618
00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.273
I don't know what that's like.

619
00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.671
But I do know what it's like
to be afraid and overwhelmed.

620
00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.480
You all came here
because you wanted answers

621
00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.950
and you needed help.

622
00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:43.115
Myself and everybody else here
at CCPD are here to help you.

623
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.792
So I swear to you.

624
00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:49.237
with a little bit of patience
from all of us.

625
00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:53.877
we will get through
this together.

626
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.156
Thank you.

627
00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.276
Officers. let's start moving
the line again.

628
00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.636
We're gonna get to everybody.

629
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.839
Hold onto your butts.

630
00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.194
They're connected.

631
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.674
I can see
the completed atomizer.

632
00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.070
But I can't see
where she's taking it.

633
00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.072
Remember. Nora.
that's not your anger.

634
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.634
It's hers.

635
00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.191
Ah-ah. Nora.

636
00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:48.114
I see what you're doing.

637
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.271
Okay. something
pissed her off.

638
00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.591
Is your memory machine
letting you back into my head?

639
00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.194
No.

640
00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.272
This is all me.

641
00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.835
I can't let you
release that virus. Grace.

642
00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.400
Thousands will die.

643
00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.757
Thousands today.
Even more tomorrow.

644
00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.638
The world I wake up in

645
00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:22.157
is overrun with people
with impossible powers.

646
00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:24.630
Destroying innocent lives.

647
00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:28.839
Ripping families apart.
Just like mine was.

648
00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.794
And all of this is
because of you!

649
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.520
Uh. is that bad?

650
00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.757
Well. it's not good.
I'm pulling her out.

651
00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.878
No. no.
No. she'll get control.

652
00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:50.711
Your Flash family
created meta-humans.

653
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.516
The Particle Accelerator.
The bus metas.

654
00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:58.593
The Enlightenment satellite
which you shattered!

655
00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.591
This isn't my anger.

656
00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.955
It's yours.

657
00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.710
You may look different.
Grace.

658
00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.554
But you're still
the angry little girl I met

659
00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:13.960
the first time I came here.

660
00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.559
I'm sorry you have
to carry that anger.

661
00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.552
But you're gonna have
to carry it alone

662
00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.275
because I make
my own decisions.

663
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.159
and I've decided not
to be like you.

664
00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.394
Nora! Nora.
Hey!

665
00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:44.473
She's... she's at CCPD.

666
00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.794
Get everybody out of here
right now!

667
00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.951
- Cecile. go. Go!
- Move. move. move!

668
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.515
And now their end begins.

669
00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.635
Cicada's at CCPD
but she could use the atomizer

670
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.200
to spread the virus
from anywhere.

671
00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.416
There are hundreds
of metas there.

672
00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.776
She's going to try
and take all of their lives.

673
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.440
Not their lives.
their dark matter.

674
00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:35.439
She's going to use
all those metas like a battery.

675
00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.560
What are we gonna do?

676
00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.552
Reach in. lose our powers.
destroy the dagger.

677
00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.040
stop Cicada
from Supergirl-ing away.

678
00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.077
then regroup
for the emotional fallout.

679
00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.717
Fallout.
Cisco. where did you send

680
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.376
Fallout's energy
when he was going nuclear?

681
00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.595
Earth-15. It's a dead Earth.

682
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:50.920
Let's breach
the atomizer there.

683
00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.474
I'm coming with you!

684
00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.358
Nora. look.

685
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.154
You've already helped.
More than enough. all right?

686
00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.799
Okay.

687
00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.792
Just do me a favor.

688
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.392
Blast that dagger to hell.

689
00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.272
Absolutely.

690
00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.669
Get out of my precinct.

691
00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.040
Hey. Cricket freak.

692
00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:26.431
You and I have
some unfinished business.

693
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.796
- Nice hit.
- It won't keep her down long.

694
00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.076
Why do we have our powers?
Did we already win?

695
00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.198
Not yet.
The dagger's in the atomizer.

696
00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.999
Wait. wait. wait!

697
00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.736
If we shoot the dagger
while it's still in there.

698
00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.880
it could detonate the virus.

699
00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.838
Guys. she's waking up.

700
00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.416
All right. figure out
a way to stop it.

701
00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.716
- We'll keep her off your back.
- All right.

702
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.473
This will help.

703
00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.393
Cisco. remove the dagger and
then breach the atomizer away.

704
00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.680
Yeah. there's a slight
problem there.

705
00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.996
Breaching this thing
anywhere could set it off.

706
00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.560
<i>My powers are useless here.</i>

707
00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:09.394
Then use your other power.
Your mind.

708
00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.311
Bring up
the atomizer blueprints.

709
00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.552
I'm gonna have to science
the crap out of you.

710
00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.472
Good morning. sunshine.

711
00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.816
A little different without your
power-dampening dagger. huh?

712
00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.356
Oh. I don't need
a dagger to kill you.

713
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.909
I never had it
before I came to this time.

714
00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.155
You wanna kill me?
Come get me.

715
00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:01.515
What she said.

716
00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.816
Once you remove the plate.
you should be able to see

717
00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.194
the control processor plane.

718
00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.840
I see it.
It's not gonna work.

719
00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.196
I need a quantum computer
to hack this thing.

720
00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.591
Wait! I have one.

721
00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.273
Yeah.

722
00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.838
Your gauntlet.

723
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.593
Damn. I love the future.

724
00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.436
Okay. if I can connect
to the three nodes inside.

725
00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.193
I'll override the system.

726
00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.511
If I touch anything else.

727
00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.279
<i>hasta la vista.</i> baby.

728
00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.430
Okay.

729
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.352
There. I got it.

730
00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.636
Yeah. great. Um. how long
for the other two?

731
00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.550
However long we have left.

732
00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.675
Two down.

733
00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.395
Well. you're not great at
the Operation game. are you?

734
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.671
You suck at
constructive criticism!

735
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.751
Cisco. get out of there.

736
00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.797
Almost there.

737
00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.712
It's in.

738
00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.633
<i>Oh. shrap.</i>

739
00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.473
Cisco. what's going on?

740
00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.395
It's too late.

741
00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.760
Gotcha.

742
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.356
- The Atomizer's off.
- Flash!

743
00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:10.151
The dagger.

744
00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.914
<i>If anything's gonna destroy
that dagger.</i>

745
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.957
it's gonna be the mirror gun.

746
00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.238
Something doesn't add up.
Thawne's plans got plans.

747
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.913
She didn't have the dagger
in the future.

748
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.237
The dagger is Thawne's plan.

749
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.879
Don't shoot it!

750
00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.440
<i>Greg. move your head.</i>
