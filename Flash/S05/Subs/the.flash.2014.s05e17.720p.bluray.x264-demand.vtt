00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.795
<i>My name is Barry Allen.</i>

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.076
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.196
<i>To the outside world.</i>

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.192
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist.</i>

5
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.595
<i>But secretly. with the help</i>

6
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.319
<i>of my friends
at S.T.A.R. Labs.</i>

7
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.234
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

8
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.551
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help.</i>

9
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.871
<i>she changed the present...</i>

10
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.475
<i>and now our world
is more dangerous than ever.</i>

11
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.870
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.277
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

13
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.033
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

14
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.237
Who is your accomplice. Nora?

15
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.551
The cure's finished.
and it works.

16
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.869
- What do you do?
- Trust me.

17
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.440
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

18
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.590
We made an arrangement.

19
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.751
<i>We cure him and then Grace.</i>

20
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.992
That is a new timeline
struggling to break through.

21
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.480
<i>Something big is coming.</i>

22
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.560
What's going on?

23
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.715
Please!

24
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.016
If Cicada
doesn't exist anymore.

25
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.269
who was that?

26
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.878
I've missed you. Uncle Orlin.

27
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.160
Something went wrong.

28
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.277
We got Dwyer.
We gave him the cure.

29
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.635
This should all be over.

30
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.632
But another Cicada showed up.

31
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.280
took Dwyer and the dagger.

32
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.272
Thawne!
Did you hear what I said?

33
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.840
Another Cicada showed up.

34
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.990
I know.

35
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.037
I know.

36
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.356
Who is that?

37
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.759
I have no idea.

38
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.596
You said manipulating
the timeline would stop Cicada.

39
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.478
You said you knew
what you were doing!

40
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.279
I know what I said.

41
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.395
I was very wrong.

42
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.598
What do we do?
What do we do now?

43
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.240
I can't help you anymore...

44
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.834
little runner.

45
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.155
What?

46
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.994
You have to help me.

47
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.558
It's too late.

48
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.399
No.

49
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.233
No. there's gotta be something
we can do.

50
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.994
You... you have to help!

51
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.640
There is only one thing
left to do.

52
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.040
Tell your father.

53
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.751
You tell your father
everything.

54
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.480
Your lung's healing.

55
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.816
It'll take a while
for you to get

56
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.160
the rest of your strength back.

57
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.835
but don't worry.

58
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.310
I'll take care of you.

59
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.993
Like you took care of me.

60
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.873
Who are you?

61
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.554
Grace?

62
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.112
Hi. Uncle Orlin.

63
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.270
But you were...

64
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.192
A ten-year-old girl
in a coma?

65
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.077
Eventually. that girl
at the hospital wakes up.

66
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.072
She grows older.

67
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.311
and she becomes me.

68
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.917
You're from the future.
like Flash's daughter.

69
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.357
I came back here
to work with you again.

70
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.235
And I remember everything
you taught me. Uncle Orlin.

71
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.954
Now. get some rest.

72
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.359
Wait.

73
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.593
Where are we?

74
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.997
No one will find you
while I'm gone.

75
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.515
There's noodles in the pantry
if you're hungry.

76
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.954
And ice cream.

77
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.633
Where are you going?

78
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.037
To take care
of something important.

79
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.918
When I get back...

80
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.671
We're gonna figure out
how you get your powers back.

81
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.478
<i>And Dr. Ambres never talked</i>

82
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.358
about her relationship
with Orlin Dwyer?

83
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.318
She never really talked
about anything.

84
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.756
After her fiancé died.
she wasn't quite the same.

85
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.399
How so?

86
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.676
Angry. Withdrawn.

87
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.876
Only time she seemed happy

88
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.376
was when she was with that girl
in the coma.

89
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.996
Can you think of anything
that might help us find Dwyer?

90
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.799
I'm sorry. Detective.

91
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.670
Okay. if you come up
with anything.

92
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.991
would you give me
a call. please?

93
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.480
Thank you.

94
00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.960
Somebody's gotta know
something.

95
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.760
Everyone we've talked to
is telling the truth.

96
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.309
I think Ambres was the only one
working with Dwyer.

97
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.471
Well. look. we'll pore over
the files at CCPD.

98
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.199
Maybe we missed something.

99
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.416
We'll let you know if we come
up with anything. all right?

100
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.239
You okay?

101
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.755
I just. uh...

102
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.111
don't know what to do.

103
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.953
Yeah. me neither.

104
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.033
We've hit walls before. though.

105
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.032
We'll figure it out.

106
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.677
All right.

107
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.515
Nora West-Allen.
let's see what we have here.

108
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.876
Boring. Boring. Boring.

109
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.714
Banality. Boring. Boring.

110
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.951
Come on.

111
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.790
I know you're working
with someone. but no names.

112
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.035
Clever girl.

113
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.600
<i>Hey.</i>

114
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.416
<i>This Cortex isn't gonna
clean itself. you know.</i>

115
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.000
Oh. nice table.
Liking the new digs.

116
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.833
Well. technically.
they're old digs.

117
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.311
but I guess there is an upside
to remodeling after an attack.

118
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.675
Did you guys find anything?

119
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.876
Well. I put out an article.

120
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.056
but none of my readers
have seen Dwyer

121
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.116
or this new Cicada.

122
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.034
I talked to Earl Cox.
all my contacts... nothing.

123
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.656
How long till the satellite
can scan for dark matter?

124
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.000
How about now?

125
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.311
Well. if this new Cicada

126
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.993
even has traceable dark matter.

127
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.816
I mean. we've seen
Cicada <i>numéro deux</i> do things

128
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.160
that we've not seen
before. right?

129
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.793
Yeah. I mean.
he can dampen powers.

130
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.997
he can control the dagger
just like Dwyer.

131
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.356
but it's... I don't know.
it's also like...

132
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.557
Like he could take control
of us.

133
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.096
Let's hope Caitlin
can figure that out

134
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.270
at the Tannhauser site

135
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.431
while we figure out
where he is.

136
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.070
We got a Starchives asset
in Kolins Woods.

137
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.230
Starchives? What is this?

138
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.152
Well. it's a place
where we house

139
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.216
everything Flash related...
prototypes. super suits...

140
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.038
I mean.
everything since day one.

141
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.336
And the alarm
is going off because...

142
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.831
Because somebody just stole
something from us.

143
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.675
Something really.
really not good.

144
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.319
You guys
at the Starchives yet?

145
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.595
We just got here.

146
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.160
No sign of forced entry.

147
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.754
Or overhead lighting.
apparently.

148
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.434
Pretty sure that's a vacuum.

149
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.840
<i>Okay. keep looking!</i>

150
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.832
Remind me again
what we're looking for?

151
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:36.518
Uh. it's like a huge
round glass bubble.

152
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.438
You mean like that?

153
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.079
- Yeah.
- We found it!

154
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.736
<i>Thawne's Time Sphere?
Are you sure?</i>

155
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.399
What do you mean "am I sure?"

156
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.597
- Pretty sure.
- I'm looking right at it. why?

157
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.316
'Cause we're looking
right at it too.

158
00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.714
So it's here
and it's in the Starchives

159
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.757
at the same time?

160
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.718
Somebody stole the plans
and made a duplicate?

161
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.393
Not exactly.

162
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.440
Guys. cue up
Operation: Shazam.

163
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.514
<i>Ready.</i>

164
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.714
One scratch
on two different Time Spheres.

165
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.156
Or one scratch
on one Time Sphere.

166
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.153
That's impossible...
unless...

167
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.390
Unless it's the same one.

168
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.517
It is the same one.

169
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.239
This is our Time Sphere.

170
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.198
Which shows up here
at the same time

171
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.193
that someone who looks like
Cicada kidnaps Orlin Dwyer.

172
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.999
It's not a coincidence.

173
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.280
So whoever kidnapped Dwyer...

174
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.158
Is the Cicada
from the future.

175
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.032
<i>♪ What a wonderful night ♪</i>

176
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.270
<i>♪ Let's dance ♪</i>

177
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.034
You move. I shoot.

178
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.749
That was dumb.

179
00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.275
It was him. wasn't it?

180
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.430
The other Cicada.

181
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.591
Guy didn't know what hit him.

182
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.478
You said he was after
a cold case file?

183
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.392
- Are any of them digitized?
- Not yet.

184
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.790
But the only way
to figure out what's missing

185
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.872
is to see what's still here.

186
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.280
I mean...

187
00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.432
I could help with that.

188
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.472
All right. everybody.
Clear out.

189
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.789
CSI needs this scene.

190
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.470
Hey. by the way.

191
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.040
this might not be
our only lead.

192
00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.077
Do you remember
that Time Sphere

193
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.435
that we built for Thawne?

194
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.239
That big hamster ball thing?

195
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.880
Someone stole one
in the future to come here.

196
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.680
For what. our...
our Cicada copycat?

197
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.797
It makes sense.

198
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.315
I can't even believe
I just said that.

199
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.400
Okay. son. you're on.

200
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.480
Yup.

201
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.958
Okay.
I went through everything.

202
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.236
There was indeed
one file missing.

203
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.349
And it's... thank you...
it is from 2017.

204
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.760
That's it.

205
00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.056
All right.
I'll do some digging.

206
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.355
see why this was so important.

207
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.999
they had to cut a hole
in the wall.

208
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.072
- I'll help.
- Yeah.

209
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.313
<i>Are you sure
you want to do this?</i>

210
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.835
I mean. this is a big deal.

211
00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.550
Like. "not Penny's boat"
kind of big deal.

212
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.830
Okay.

213
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.271
Kamilla Hwang.
you and I are officially...

214
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.556
"In a Relationship."

215
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.313
- Social media official!
- What!

216
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.437
Yeah.

217
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.000
Larry. my usual.

218
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.151
It's Jason.

219
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.074
Ralph!
What um...

220
00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.389
what are you doing here?

221
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.960
Same as you...
taking a break

222
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.190
from saving the old world.

223
00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.272
- Um...
- Look at you two.

224
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.431
Young love.

225
00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.989
So. uh. K-Dawg.
when you gonna meet the group?

226
00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.958
Uh. the group?

227
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.555
Yeah. the squad. the team.
The gang.

228
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.791
Uh. hey. we're actually
in the middle of a date here.

229
00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.496
Actually. we're at the end
of a date. babe.

230
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.239
- I have that gig.
- Oh. right.

231
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.640
Your Easter thing.
You have to go.

232
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.637
- She has to go.
- Oh. uh. Cisco?

233
00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.189
I'm supposed to tell you
that Barry wanted to talk to you.

234
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.595
Probably could've texted that.

235
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.433
Yeah. probably.

236
00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.040
Okay. well.
Easter Bunny photos

237
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.355
aren't gonna take themselves.

238
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.800
It's kind of
a bottom-of-the-barrel

239
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.950
photography gig.

240
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.320
but gotta start somewhere.
right?

241
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.680
- Totally.
- Anywhere but here.

242
00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.911
- Why don't I walk you out?
- Oh. okay.

243
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.676
Damn it. Larry!

244
00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.830
Still Jason!

245
00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.194
<i>Voilà. voilà. voilà.</i>

246
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.397
Let's see what we have here.

247
00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.393
Thawne's Time Sphere.

248
00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.915
What are you doing.
Sherloque?

249
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.235
Well. I'm pursuing a new lead

250
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.277
to identify the mystery Cicada.

251
00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.840
Well.
if you needed information

252
00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.736
about the Time Sphere.
you could've just asked.

253
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.197
That's right.
but memory can be deceiving.

254
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.512
Especially for a regular human.

255
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.435
No. I prefer a primary source.

256
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.670
And this new lead.

257
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.877
were you pursuing it
last night too?

258
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.395
- That's right.
- And all last weekend?

259
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.630
That's right.

260
00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.554
I am working very hard
to get...

261
00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.279
to get what I want.

262
00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.840
Joe traced the file
that our new Cicada took.

263
00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.639
There was a meta attack here
two years ago.

264
00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.837
Two people died.
and the meta was never ID'd.

265
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.071
So this new Cicada
might be going after this meta?

266
00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.117
- Well...
- Okay.

267
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.520
What do I vibe?

268
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.353
Well. we're not exactly sure.

269
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.536
All the street cameras were
destroyed by the explosion.

270
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.917
The original ATM was too fried
to recover any data.

271
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.753
- For real?
- Yeah.

272
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.399
Well. I'm out.

273
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.075
I can't vibe a crime scene
that does not exist.

274
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.799
Literally does not exist.

275
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.357
I mean. even this ATM is.
like. brand-spanking-new.

276
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.830
But this concrete isn't.

277
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.320
It still has scorch marks
on it.

278
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.834
Hold this.

279
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.951
Sweetie!
You forgot your ATM card.

280
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.675
What'd you see?

281
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.399
The victims.

282
00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.278
They were
Grace Gibbons' parents.

283
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.157
In Grace's mindscape.
she saw herself as Cicada.

284
00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.597
And another Cicada shows up
targeting her parents' killer.

285
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.955
It has to be her.

286
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.475
The new Cicada
is Grace Gibbons.

287
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.710
From the future.

288
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.594
Time travel sucks.

289
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.309
Grace. what's wrong?

290
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.360
Look at this.

291
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.513
It's your parents' murder file?

292
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.274
Do you see what they did?

293
00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.360
Nothing!

294
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.238
Three witnesses saw a woman

295
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.576
in a hoodie leave the scene.
but did Central City's finest

296
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.831
put out a search party
or an APB?

297
00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.231
No. They thought it sounded
like a job for the Flash.

298
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.391
Look at this debris
from the scene.

299
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.757
Looks like a chemical burn.

300
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.309
It's not a chemical burn.

301
00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.070
It's charred
dark matter residue.

302
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.436
We can track the meta
who left it.

303
00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.398
How?

304
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.473
I can't track
an exact real time location.

305
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.789
but I can get close.

306
00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.592
Found her.

307
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.313
Grace. what are you doing?

308
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.551
In the time I'm from.
their plague spreads

309
00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.712
across the world.
unchecked. unabated.

310
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.190
But now that I'm here with you.

311
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.397
we can change that.

312
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.830
And the mission can succeed.

313
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.513
What mission?

314
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.114
Ours.

315
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.590
To kill every last meta-human.

316
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.432
Starting with the rat bastard
who killed my parents.

317
00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.316
So. Cicada Il is really
Grace from the future.

318
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.278
and she's trying to get revenge
on the meta

319
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.795
that murdered her parents.
and that killer meta is here?

320
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.759
Cisco saw the last PIN
that was entered into the ATM.

321
00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.593
The card belongs
to Vickie and John Bolen.

322
00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.273
We already went
by their house.

323
00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.136
and a neighbor said
they were having a party here.

324
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.753
Um. I think this is them.

325
00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.479
Excuse me. sir?

326
00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.950
Detective Joe West.
We're from CCPD.

327
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.236
Are you Mr. John Bolen?

328
00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.919
I am.
How can I help you?

329
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
What's going on? Oh.

330
00:17:35.001 --> 00:17:36.195
Sorry to be rude.

331
00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.680
but we're in the middle
of a party.

332
00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.911
This won't take long.
Um...

333
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.516
Do you remember using an ATM
on Kingswell and 42nd

334
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.751
around May 4th. 2017?

335
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.433
There was an explosion
that day.

336
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.115
We think a meta-human
might have been involved.

337
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.953
Hon. why don't you and Alice
start gathering

338
00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.235
the kids for a team photo?

339
00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.471
I'll talk to the nice officers.

340
00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.393
Okay.

341
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.216
I can't believe you found me
after all this time.

342
00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.153
We'd just like to know
what happened that day.

343
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.879
Did you blow up that ATM?

344
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.679
I-it all happened so fast.

345
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.194
I touched the machine.

346
00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.272
and it was like
something turned on in me.

347
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.040
You hyper-accelerated
the molecules in the ATM.

348
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.396
causing a violent
chain reaction.

349
00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.472
I just know I saw sparks
and ran.

350
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.710
Then I heard this explosion

351
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.598
and money was flying
everywhere.

352
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.672
It looked like I was trying
to rob the bank.

353
00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.719
I was too afraid to go back.

354
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.154
At least no one got hurt.

355
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.360
Mrs. Bolen.
we have reason to believe

356
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.397
a killer is targeting you.

357
00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.073
Why?

358
00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.914
It's because
of your... abilities.

359
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.515
Listen. we'd like to put you
in federal protection

360
00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.960
to keep your family safe.

361
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.554
And what would I tell
my husband?

362
00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.869
Or my daughter?

363
00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.394
"Hey. sorry. Mommy has powers.

364
00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.040
We all have to leave
our lives behind."

365
00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.640
They don't know
about your powers?

366
00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.712
Of course not.
No one does.

367
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.393
You think I'm proud of this?

368
00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.437
I think they have a right
to know the truth.

369
00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.670
They're your family.

370
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.696
And who the hell
do you think you are.

371
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.790
telling me what to do?

372
00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.758
We're not going anywhere.

373
00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.877
That's final.

374
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.195
Please leave.

375
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.836
She's not safe.
We're staying put.

376
00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.719
I got your text.
What's the emergency?

377
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.519
Okay.
Listen to me very carefully.

378
00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.280
I took a break from
serial killer kidnapper madness

379
00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.591
to do something awesome.

380
00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.717
So I decided
on a new career path.

381
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.280
Photography was always
my passion.

382
00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.696
and I figured why not
make it my job?

383
00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.154
These are great. Kamilla.

384
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.038
I Peter Parker'd her.

385
00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.554
Dibs. sidebar.

386
00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.676
Sidebar?

387
00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.274
Sidebar. now!

388
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.480
You have. uh...
Peter Parker'd her.

389
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.029
Yeah. I mean.
Kamilla is a great photographer

390
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.589
and I thought she could start
taking some pictures for Iris.

391
00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.776
and then maybe she'd start
to come around S.T.A.R. Labs.

392
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.256
I don't know. if we're lucky.
get bitten

393
00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.158
by something radioactive.

394
00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.469
Become. like. a Spider-Person.

395
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.995
So. while you thought.
did it occur to you

396
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.640
that no one asked you
to do this?

397
00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.074
You don't think she'd make
a good Spider-Person?

398
00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.311
You listen to me
and you listen good.

399
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.550
you turkey on stilts.

400
00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.233
It is not your job

401
00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.915
to get my girlfriend
on the team!

402
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.435
- Hey. guys.
- Hey. you two!

403
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.432
You guys are getting along
in there. I see that.

404
00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.193
What's going on?

405
00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.555
Your friend Iris was actually

406
00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.960
just giving me
a photography gig.

407
00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.397
Well. it's small.
but Kamilla has agreed to shoot

408
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.393
the Fenway parade
for the <i>Citizen</i> this weekend.

409
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.392
Shut the front door.

410
00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.279
That is unbelievable.

411
00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.113
Congrats.
That's amazing.

412
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.590
Hey. why don't you and I go.
uh. drink and celebrate?

413
00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.911
Oh. sure.
Um. I will text you later.

414
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.320
Yes. that sounds great.
Thank you.

415
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.993
- You ready?
- Yeah.

416
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.360
Well. well. well.

417
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.793
<i>Bonjour.</i> Eobard Thawne.

418
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.315
If I am Eobard Thawne.

419
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.598
what kind of man am I?

420
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.240
Patient. right?

421
00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.232
Master of science.

422
00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.516
But also...

423
00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.032
a master of...

424
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.074
subterfuge.

425
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.597
Because not only...

426
00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.353
am I...

427
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.591
Eobard Thawne.

428
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.191
but I'm also...

429
00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.514
Dr. Harrison Wells.

430
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.879
And that man...

431
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.317
that man would keep
his secrets...

432
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.080
...close.

433
00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.832
What have we here?

434
00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.555
Well. well. well.

435
00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.439
<i>Bonjour.</i>

436
00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.797
How could Vickie not know
she killed two people?

437
00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.519
There was a time
in Central City

438
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.069
where not all meta attacks
were public knowledge.

439
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.038
Why not?
I mean. people should know...

440
00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.396
Former Mayor Bellows...

441
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.400
...tried to keep certain things
out of the media.

442
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.511
Said he didn't want
to create a panic.

443
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.717
Turns out he had metas
on the payroll.

444
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.075
Didn't want the heat.

445
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.674
That's Cecile.
I'll be right back.

446
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:23.830
Hey.

447
00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.114
You were wrong. you know.

448
00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.560
About what?

449
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.296
About Vickie not wanting
to tell her family

450
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.800
about her abilities.

451
00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.314
It's her choice
not to tell them.

452
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.996
Look. keeping a secret
like that

453
00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.436
from her family is...
it's dangerous.

454
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.751
I mean. they might get hurt
or worse.

455
00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.394
She's just trying
to protect them.

456
00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.996
I get that. I do. but...

457
00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.800
I-I used to think that keeping
secrets from people

458
00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.236
for their own good
was a noble decision.

459
00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.676
that it would protect them.

460
00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.576
But when you do that.
you just rob those people

461
00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.069
from making
their own decisions.

462
00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.198
I even did it with you.

463
00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.176
Like when you didn't want
to take me to your past.

464
00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.839
Mm-hmm.

465
00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.256
I didn't want you to see
how painful

466
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.600
things got for me as the Flash

467
00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.400
or how bad things got
for your mom.

468
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:17.076
But secrets
are like walls. and...

469
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.240
you can't really know someone
with walls between you.

470
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.395
Ah!

471
00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.437
Hey!

472
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.154
Hey. Are you okay?

473
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.760
I must have connected
to Grace's mind.

474
00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.069
She's coming.

475
00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.435
Grace is coming.

476
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.397
I don't see Cicada anywhere.
Do you?

477
00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.358
It's the Flash!

478
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:49.354
Mom. you got Flash and XS
cosplayers for the party?

479
00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:54.390
Yes. I am the Flash!
And I love...

480
00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.312
Soccer. do you guys
love soccer?

481
00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.357
Do you want to...
yeah. or... awesome!

482
00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.440
Come with me!

483
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.896
Here. let's play some soccer
over here.

484
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.696
This way. This way.
Come on. come on. come on.

485
00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.473
Help me with the kids.
Come on. come on!

486
00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.914
Far away from there.

487
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.151
What's going on?
Cicada is coming here.

488
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.799
- What?
- Now.

489
00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.394
We can move everyone else
out of here.

490
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.240
but you and your family
have to come with me.

491
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.396
All right.

492
00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.991
- Murderer.
- Grace. stop.

493
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.440
She's innocent.
It was an accident.

494
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.830
There are no accidents. Nora.

495
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.116
Vickie?

496
00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.114
- We have to help Mom.
- Alice!

497
00:24:42.561 --> 00:24:43.994
Alice. no!

498
00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.951
Alice!

499
00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.157
My speed's back.

500
00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.640
We need to get them
out of here.

501
00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.555
I'll find you.

502
00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.636
I can't believe

503
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.154
that little girl in there

504
00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.199
grows up to be
a time-traveling serial killer.

505
00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.317
Why can't we just wake her up
right now?

506
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.790
We tried before.
It didn't work.

507
00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.456
What about the meta cure
y'all cooked up?

508
00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.119
We'd need Grace's consent.

509
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.351
Besides. Caitlin says
that her condition

510
00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.999
is too fragile to even try.

511
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.673
And I'm assuming
that destroying

512
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.553
the time-traveling
hamster ball.

513
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.199
that messes up the timeline?

514
00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.636
Yeah. it would probably
just make things even worse.

515
00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.313
- Oh. God!
- Whoa. what's wrong?

516
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.550
Her mind.

517
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.040
It's exactly the same
as the Cicada

518
00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.554
that attacked us
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

519
00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.998
Oh. my God. it's filled
with nothing but hatred.

520
00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.640
Nora found out
when she went into Grace's mind

521
00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.713
that Grace could hear Dwyer.
even in her coma...

522
00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.190
his anger. his rage.

523
00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.794
She was listening.

524
00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.314
She can carry out his words.

525
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.119
Uh. hey. guys.

526
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.317
Uh. Alice is back from the OR
and she's okay.

527
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.074
but her parents are really not.

528
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.039
<i>Vickie. I asked you to leave!</i>

529
00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.520
She's my daughter.

530
00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.593
No. I want my dad.

531
00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.320
Can't you see
that she's terrified of you?

532
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.470
She could've been killed!

533
00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.074
I was trying
to protect you guys.

534
00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.436
By lying?
You're a meta. Vickie!

535
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.955
A human time bomb!
How do you keep that from us?

536
00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.475
Mr. Bolen...
let's take a breath.

537
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.040
Let's step outside.

538
00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.751
Hey. we did the right thing.

539
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.150
We kept this family safe.

540
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.469
Then why does it feel like

541
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:53.031
we made everything
so much worse?

542
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.240
Need any help with that. uh...

543
00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.350
Nope.

544
00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.936
Unless you came here
to break something.

545
00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.874
in which case
you'd be the perfect candidate.

546
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.354
I deserve that.

547
00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.797
I never should've interfered
with Kamilla.

548
00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.440
Sometimes I forget how...

549
00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.637
embarrassing I can be.

550
00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.030
I'm not embarrassed by you.
and I'm not embarrassed

551
00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.679
by anyone on Team Flash.

552
00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.638
You guys are my family.
You're not the problem.

553
00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.350
This is the problem.
This is the problem.

554
00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:45.156
Kamilla is blissfully unaware

555
00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.199
of any of the madness
that goes on in S.T.A.R. Labs.

556
00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.671
or that we routinely save
the city from evil metas.

557
00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.296
Right. or that you have
a secret identity

558
00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.631
and dress up in leather
and go all pew-pew!

559
00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.155
Especially the leather.

560
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.397
She and I.
we got a good thing.

561
00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:05.838
And being with somebody
has never felt so...

562
00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.673
so easy.

563
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.433
And when I'm with her.
for once.

564
00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.989
I just feel like a normal dude.

565
00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.480
with a normal life

566
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.950
and a social-media-official
girlfriend.

567
00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.953
who happens to be
a very talented photographer

568
00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.351
and not... a Spider-Person.

569
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:31.518
It's... that's amazing. man.
It really is.

570
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.832
And I promise
that I will respect that.

571
00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.717
But I gotta ask.
how long do you think

572
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.350
you can keep
those two worlds separate?

573
00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.433
Look... my mom dated
this guy. Craig.

574
00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:49.070
and Craig was a tax accountant
and a freelance bull rider.

575
00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.879
Never let one world
know about the other.

576
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.794
and... it just tore him up.

577
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.553
More than those bulls ever did.

578
00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.155
Mm.
I should definitely be working.

579
00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.311
Look. the thing is.
I get why you're afraid

580
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.232
of losing what you have
with Kamilla.

581
00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.472
but if you keep her out
of this world...

582
00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.994
it seems to me
that you're always

583
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:10.596
gonna be turning off
a part of yourself.

584
00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.637
That's not right.

585
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.096
And if Craig hadn't
been crushed to death

586
00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.954
by that huge filing cabinet...

587
00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.111
I know he'd feel the same way.

588
00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.512
I didn't get her.

589
00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.352
Well. maybe that's
a good thing.

590
00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.753
'cause I've read this file
and it doesn't make sense.

591
00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:53.517
Grace. there was no money
taken from the crime scene.

592
00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.195
I think what happened
to your mom and dad

593
00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.430
might've been an accident.

594
00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.638
She killed my parents.
Uncle Orlin!

595
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.996
It wasn't an accident!

596
00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.356
You sound like them.

597
00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.558
Why do you sound like them?

598
00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.438
Grace. your head.

599
00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.273
We gotta get you to Dr. Ambres.

600
00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.874
She'll know how to help.

601
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.476
She's not helping anyone.
Not anymore.

602
00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.597
Why not?

603
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.037
I killed her.

604
00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.351
But Dr. Ambres
saved your life.

605
00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.999
And destroyed yours.

606
00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.878
You had a gift.

607
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:33.432
An unbreakable weapon that fell
from the sky for you to use.

608
00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.711
For you to control.

609
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.917
And she took that power
away from you.

610
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.153
No. Grace.

611
00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.197
I wanted that cure.

612
00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.272
And I wanted you
to have it too.

613
00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.875
No. No. that's impossible.

614
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.999
We were supposed
to do this together.

615
00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.754
Grace. I just wanted you
to be happy.

616
00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:57.595
That's all I ever wanted.

617
00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.479
I love you. Grace.
You're my family.

618
00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:07.596
And you'd do anything
to save me. right?

619
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.675
I know what I have to do.

620
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.160
Grace. stop.

621
00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:22.591
Grace. stop!
Grace. please!

622

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.751
<i>Analysis complete...
handwriting match</i>

649
00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.399
<i>for Harrison Wells confirmed.</i>

650
00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.040
<i>Will that be all. Dr. Wells?</i>

651
00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.474
Yes. Gideon.

652
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.913
That will be all.

653
00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:05.000
And that's why I didn't tell
you about my powers.

654
00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:08.073
I thought it would be
too hard for you.

655
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.231
But you're tough.

656
00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.233
Tougher than I've ever been.

657
00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:17.234
So maybe you can be tough
for me too?

658
00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.033
They're a good family.

659
00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.237
Told you they'd figure it out.

660
00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.200
Dad...

661
00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.952
I need to tell you something.

662
00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.760
Oh. baby. what's wrong?

663
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.069
Grace's mind.

664
00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.431
Oh. it's getting
so much stronger.

665
00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.350
She's here.

666
00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.315
Are you okay?

667
00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.751
Vickie Bolen!

668
00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.309
Give yourself over to me.

669
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.357
or your husband dies.

670
00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.671
This Cicada doesn't care
if someone's a meta or not.

671
00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.399
She'll kill anyone
who stands in her way.

672
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.596
XS. get her out of here

673
00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:27.856
before Cicada tries that again.

674
00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:28.916
Do not slow down.

675
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.037
Detective. we need to get her
somewhere safe.

676
00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.120
Mom?

677
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.256
I'm not leaving
without Alice.

678
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.440
You're the target.
Mrs. Bolen.

679
00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.240
She's safer without you.
Come on. Alice. let's go.

680
00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.552
Come on. sweetie.
let's get you somewhere safe.

681
00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.751
XS. go!

682
00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.472
- What do you got?
- Well. we have a situation.

683
00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.789
Or two. actually.

684
00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.200
So that's the new Cicada.

685
00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.755
and that's the dagger
chasing Nora and Ms. Bolen.

686
00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.674
<i>- Guys. I need help!</i>
- Time to move.

687
00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.760
<i>Grace.</i>

688
00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:02.876
Let him go.

689
00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.176
I know you want revenge
for your parents. but...

690
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.192
But it wasn't
that woman's fault.

691
00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.874
That doesn't change
that they're dead.

692
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.872
Or that I became this.

693
00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.431
- We can help you.
- With your cure?

694
00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.831
There's only one cure
for this. Flash.

695
00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.593
Death.

696
00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.176
<i>Guys. I can't keep this up.</i>

697
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.976
Nora. you need to hang on
for a little bit longer.

698
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.856
- You're gonna turn on...
- The alleyway on Fuller.

699
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.160
The alleyway on Fuller.
Be ready.

700
00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.435
<i>For what?</i>

701
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.751
- Ooh. I am not loving that.
- Nope.

702
00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.520
Guys. we need you two
at the hospital.

703
00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:58.676
Let's go.

704
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.536
- What the hell was that?
- Cisco. what happened?

705
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.136
I don't know.
Something's wrong with my breach.

706
00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.560
We can't get through it!

707
00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:13.314
I've always wanted
to be up against the Flash

708
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.750
and his legendary team.

709
00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:19.436
I guess I wasn't missing out
on anything after all.

710
00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.715
Grace!

711
00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.554
Don't do this.

712
00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.359
Please.

713
00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.955
This isn't the way to make
the world a better place.

714
00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.080
You hated them.

715
00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.953
I heard you.

716
00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.316
I was wrong.

717
00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:40.360
And that hate turned into
something even worse.

718
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.956
<i>It was wrong to make you
feel that way. Gracie.</i>

719
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:46.874
But you don't have to go down
the same path I did.

720
00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:51.000
You don't have to hold on
to this... this anger.

721
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.232
Let it go.

722
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.838
But my parents.

723
00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.832
It was an accident.

724
00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.789
Let it go.

725
00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:13.157
Before it's too late.
like it is for me.

726
00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.676
You're right. Uncle Orlin.

727
00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.800
Um...

728
00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.317
No!

729
00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.639
It is too late.

730
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.800
Hey. hey. hey.

731
00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:52.550
Save my Gracie.

732
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.872
I can't believe
she killed Dwyer.

733
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.713
Yeah. as brutal as Dwyer was.

734
00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.176
his love for his niece
always kept him

735
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.256
from crossing certain lines.

736
00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.919
Not Grace.

737
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.515
No. and her powers
are incredibly dangerous.

738
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.496
I ran some tests while I was at
the Tannhauser offsite...

739
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.354
her dark matter has some sort
of binding quality.

740
00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.238
It allows her
to telekinetically manipulate

741
00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.915
dark matter
within a certain proximity.

742
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.354
Including
the dark matter in us?

743
00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.440
I think so.

744
00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.319
I think what makes her powers
different from Dwyer's

745
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.278
is that they came
from a wound in her head.

746
00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.760
That's why
she's so much stronger.

747
00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.957
How was Nora able to see
what Grace was seeing?

748
00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.271
Nora and Grace seem to be
psychically connected.

749
00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.556
I think it's because
of the time that Nora spent

750
00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.040
in Grace's brain.

751
00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.430
- Is there any sign of her?
- No.

752
00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.432
She definitely ghosted.

753
00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.874
What about Vickie
and her family?

754
00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.839
Uh. federal protection.
They're gonna be fine.

755
00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.515
They're getting new identities
as we speak.

756
00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:00.776
I don't know
about anyone else.

757
00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.359
but I could use a drink.

758
00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.477
- Not a bad idea.
- Yeah. I'm in.

759
00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.517
- You want me to call a sitter?
- Yeah.

760
00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.796
Cisco. you want
to bring Kamilla?

761
00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:12.800
Not for this one.

762
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.676
Nora. you coming?

763
00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.080
Nora.

764
00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.517
You want to tell us something.
don't you?

765
00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.914
She wants to tell you
her secret.

766
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.673
Right?

767
00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.355
She doesn't know
where to start.

768
00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.080
Difficult to know
where to begin

769
00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:43.554
when your secret
threatens everything.

770
00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.676
everyone around you.

771
00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.989
Sherloque. stop it.

772
00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.833
Maybe start at the beginning.

773
00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.056
It's a very good place
to start.

774
00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.754
When you first time-traveled.

775
00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:55.993
<i>So careful to leave
the lightest footprint.</i>

776
00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.271
Until you suddenly
change course

777
00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.159
<i>and brazenly interfere
with the Thinker satellite</i>

778
00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.754
as it crashed to Earth.

779
00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.116
I think to myself.
"Nope. nope.

780
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:11.151
This excessive action
doesn't make sense."

781
00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:14.517
Until you understand that...

782
00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.233
it wasn't your idea.

783
00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.359
Please stop.

784
00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.954
Someone instructed you
to do it.

785
00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.509
- Stop.
- Someone...

786
00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.877
<i>whose handwriting
is in yourjournal.</i>

787
00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:32.239
<i>Someone who wrote.
"The timeline is malleable."</i>

788
00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.836
<i>Same person who's been
directing you all this time.</i>

789
00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.719
making puppets of all of us

790
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.678
as he seeks
to alter the timeline

791
00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.513
to suit his own purpose.

792
00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.118
Eobard Thawne.

793
00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:50.554
The Reverse-Flash.
Your teacher.

794
00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.155
Your partner.

795
00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.357
Your secret.

796
00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.473
Nora?

797
00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:03.076
Please tell us this isn't true.

798
00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.191
She can't.

799
00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.357
- Dad...
- Because it is true.

800
00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.956
Mom?

801
00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.837
I wanted to tell you.

802
00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.389
I-I tried to tell you.

803
00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:25.920
Dad.

804
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.196
Dad. please!

805
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.120
Dad!

806
00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.832
I'm sorry I lied to you!

807
00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.759
So am I.

808
00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.837
Dad...

809
00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.240
<i>Greg. move your head.</i>
