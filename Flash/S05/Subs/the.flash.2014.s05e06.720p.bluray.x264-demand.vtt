00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.795
<i>My name is Barry Allen.</i>

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.439
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.193
<i>To the outside world.</i>

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.192
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist.</i>

5
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.595
<i>But secretly. with the help</i>

6
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.319
<i>of my friends
at S.T.A.R. Labs.</i>

7
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.400
<i>I fight crime and find</i>

8
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.153
<i>other meta-humans like me.</i>

9
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.176
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help.</i>

10
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.680
<i>she changed the present...</i>

11
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.475
<i>and now our world
is more dangerous than ever.</i>

12
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.836
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

13
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.429
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

14
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.456
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

15
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.550
<i>You threw yourself</i>

16
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.472
off a building to save Dad?

17
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.560
Yeah.

18
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.216
<i>We all know the sound
of Cicada's breathing.</i>

19
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.390
His lungs are injured.

20
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.631
You can't keep doing this.
It's not healing.

21
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.016
<i>Killer Frost has been
gone since the night</i>

22
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.280
<i>that DeVoe took over your body.</i>

23
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.436
Is she gone for good?

24
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.616
I've tried everything
I can think of

25
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.790
to get her to reappear.

26
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.176
My father told me
to come find him.

27
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.520
<i>My dad's been dead for years.</i>

28
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.273
<i>He knew that there were
two of you.</i>

29
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.631
He knew the truth
about Killer Frost.

30
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.995
<i>We've got eyes and ears!</i>

31
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.639
I knew you could do it.

32
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.632
There's only one sure place
somebody could hide.

33
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.313
A Tannhauser black ops site.

34
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.717
Vanilla latte
and a Medium Zoom for Raelene.

35
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.439
Thank you.

36
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.155
Should've left me alone.

37
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.630
And you
never should have existed.

38
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.795
We are back in business.

39
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.990
And by business. he means

40
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.958
the better-than-Sally
the satellite business.

41
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.394
And what does that mean?

42
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.358
That means we're getting
closer to identifying

43
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.432
the ever-elusive Cicada.

44
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.239
It's Cicada. Sherloque.

45
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.960
Once I hacked
DeVoe's satellites.

46
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.795
all I had to do was just use an
impact extrapolation algorithm

47
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.076
to predict where the shrapnel
would've fallen

48
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.311
after Barry and Nora pulled
a Johnny Cage

49
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.440
on Sally the satellite.

50
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.670
May God rest her soul.

51
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.717
So now we got 46 locations

52
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.871
where 46 pieces
of shrapnel landed.

53
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.350
And once of these
locations is where Cicada

54
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.590
will have been injured.

55
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.273
Except we don't know
which one.

56
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.079
Or maybe we do.

57
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.391
You see. after my hands got
sliced by Cicada's dagger.

58
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.199
Dr. Quinn. Medicine Woman. here

59
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.158
measured the dark matter
in my system.

60
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.357
And its levels
of concentration were higher

61
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.715
than any I'd ever seen before.

62
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.400
Insanely high. and the
only part of the satellite

63
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.836
that would have dark matter
levels that high...

64
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.274
<i>Is the core.</i>

65
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.272
which is where
Cicada's dagger came from.

66
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.113
So we find the location
of the core

67
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.456
and we'll know where
Cicada was that night.

68
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.960
You know. FEMA set up sites

69
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.256
to help people after
the Enlightenment.

70
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.280
If Cicada was injured.

71
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.176
maybe he received medical
treatment at one of them.

72
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.200
That's a great idea.

73
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.920
I mean. we could check with
FEMA to see if any fathers

74
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.720
matching Cicada's description
reported any injuries

75
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.678
- near the crash site.
- So. we split up.

76
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.456
Okay. great. I'm good
at tracking things down.

77
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.312
So I will try and find
the satellite core.

78
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.120
I will come with you and
everybody else look

79
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.160
<i>for the names.</i>

80
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.016
Um. do you mind if I actually
come with you too?

81
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.236
It's just that I saw you
jump off a building last week

82
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.470
and that was awesome.

83
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.153
<i>So I thought maybe
I'd come with you</i>

84
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.038
while you did
some detective work.

85
00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.656
Oh. I think that two people
is going to be more than enough

86
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.336
- for what we need...
- What he's trying to say

87
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.397
is that we would love
to have you come with us.

88
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.312
Okay.

89
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.576
<i>All right. well.
why don't I talk to FEMA</i>

90
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.954
and see if I can get
some names.

91
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.315
Hey. I know
Joe's been itching

92
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.736
to get out of the house.
and it might help

93
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.160
to have an actual badge.

94
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.038
Nobody does case snacks
like Joe West.

95
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.920
- I'll swing by on the way.
- All right. cool.

96
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.077
So. Snow Patrol.
what's going on?

97
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.714
You tell me.

98
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.951
I'm guessing
it's not a coincidence

99
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.072
that we're left here
with nothing to do

100
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.435
for the next few hours.

101
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.671
I know we were supposed
to wait until you were ready

102
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.035
to locate your dad.

103
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.760
<i>But I had the satellites
track down</i>

104
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.270
all the decommissioned
Tannhauser black ops sites

105
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.720
that your dad
could possibly be in.

106
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.760
Okay.

107
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.596
And... and then I hacked into
their security systems.

108
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.637
He was the last person
to enter one of them.

109
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.120
A week after he died.

110
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.840
And he never left.

111
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.479
Where is he?

112
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.232
It's open. Come in.

113
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.435
Hey! Cecile.

114
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.718
- Hey.
- Is... is Joe here?

115
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.792
Uh. no.
He's out with Jenna.

116
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.473
Oh. dang.
Okay. Bummer.

117
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.200
All right. I'll go get some
falafel and come back in a bit.

118
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.555
Wait. no. Please don't...

119
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.553
Leave me here.
Um. what did you need?

120
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.393
Maybe I can help you.

121
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.393
Oh. I need somebody
to flash a badge

122
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.756
and generally
look intimidating. so.

123
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.436
You don't think
that I can be intimidating.

124
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.119
Oh. my God. you don't.
do you?

125
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.839
Ralph. I am the district
attorney.

126
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.536
You know I psychically
teleported the Flash

127
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.233
inside the Thinker's mind

128
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.556
whilst giving birth
to my daughter.

129
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.279
sans epidural... it hurt!

130
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.559
I literally saved the world
between contractions.

131
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.109
and you don't think
that I am intimidating?

132
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.032
I'm really intimidated
right now. actually.

133
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.634
You are very intimidating.

134
00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.677
Okay. what are we doing?

135
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.515
Uh. we are getting a list
of FEMA recipients treated

136
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.796
after the Enlightenment
to hopefully find

137
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.880
Cicada's real name.

138
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.270
FEMA. come on.
I've worked with them a ton.

139
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.714
I know that org inside and out.

140
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.156
Just. uh... oh. give me five.
I gotta go pump first.

141
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.833
What are we pumping?

142
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.355
Oh.

143
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.040
<i>Coordinates are set
for the North Pole.</i>

144
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.519
Thank you guys
for coming with me.

145
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.954
Ready when you are.

146
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.633
Okay.

147
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.279
Oh!
Here we go.

148
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.632
Can't see anything!

149
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.110
My face just went
full Weeknd!

150
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.475
Wait.
I think I see something.

151
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.880
Over here!

152
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.633
What?

153
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.435
I think it's a building.

154
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.876
Is there a door?

155
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.316
We don't need one.

156
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.039
Hello?
Anybody here?

157
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.157
There.

158
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.034
<i>Hey.</i>

159
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.152
You okay?

160
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.720
When my father entered
this facility

161
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.320
nearly 20 years ago.

162
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.040
he had severe ALS.

163
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.512
Maybe the reason he never left
is 'cause he couldn't.

164
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.836
Look.
whatever we find in here.

165
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.274
we'll be right here
with you.

166
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.513
Ugh.

167
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.957
It smells like science
in here.

168
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.078
What kind of research does
your mom's lab do. exactly?

169
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.551
I honestly
don't even know anymore.

170
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.676
<i>Caity?</i>

171
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.032
Dad? Is that you?

172
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.589
Is this really happening?

173
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.598
You're alive.

174
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.995
Are you... you're real?

175
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.754
Yeah. Dad. it's me.
I'm real. I'm real.

176
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.279
You found me.

177
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.352
You got my message.

178
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.399
I did in the periodic table
we made together.

179
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.360
It took me 20 years to find it.
but it led me to you.

180
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.318
I knew you would come.

181
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.800
Thank you.

182
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.752
I thank all of you.

183
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.111
Dad. these are my friends.
This is...

184
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.671
Uh. Barry Allen
and Cisco Ramon. I know.

185
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.031
Um. sorry.
How do you know us?

186
00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.634
Well. when I first came here.

187
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.393
I stayed in contact
with scientists.

188
00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.360
Louise Lincoln. Victor Fries.
and Harrison Wells.

189
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.036
Dr. Wells was able to get me
full access to. uh.

190
00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.555
S.T.A.R. Labs video uplink.

191
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.633
Wait a minute. You've... you've
had video link to S.T.A.R. Labs

192
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.836
this entire time?

193
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.310
Oh. no. God no. I mean. it
hasn't worked until recently.

194
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.153
And unfortunately.
since it rebooted.

195
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.199
its capabilities is only
as a one-way video.

196
00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.512
so I could see you
but I couldn't reach you.

197
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.513
Well. it looks like you had
plenty of toys around here

198
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.670
to keep you company.

199
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.592
This neat little incubator.

200
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.000
What's it for?

201
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.073
Well. that was here
when I got here.

202
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.550
Never had any use
for that thing.

203
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.956
I don't understand.
Why are you here?

204
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.111
I mean. how are you
still even alive?

205
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.114
ALS is a horrible disease.
and I grew desperate.

206
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.592
and I began experimenting with
therapies using cryogenics.

207
00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.592
Something went wrong?

208
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.680
Yes.

209
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.992
The. uh. experiments became
more and more dangerous.

210
00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.719
and I quarantined myself

211
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.952
for the sake
of everyone's safety.

212
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:07.354
I did manage to freeze the
progression of that disease.

213
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.751
Not before the site
was entirely closed down.

214
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.837
<i>and I have been here
ever since.</i>

215
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.856
They shut down this site
while you were still in it

216
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.599
<i>and locked you in.</i>

217
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.990
It was my mother.
wasn't it?

218
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.549
She's the only one with
an authority to shut down

219
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.114
a Tannhauser site.

220
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.336
Listen. your mother thought
it would be easier

221
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.589
for you not to see me.

222
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.957
But I always had the faith
that I could cure this thing.

223
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.874
That's why I sent you the note.

224
00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.634
So how... how did you survive
here this whole time?

225
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.838
Water.
Rations.

226
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.197
Spending months at a time
in that cryogenic chamber.

227
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.920
Well. you don't ever
have to do that again.

228
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.799
because we can get you
out of here.

229
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.712
We're gonna give you
your life back.

230
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.836
Shouldn't this place
be packed to the rafters?

231
00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.470
I mean. we had a citywide
disaster not long ago.

232
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.517
Don't worry. I got this.

233
00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.916
It's time to put
the war face on.

234
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.195
Hey. buddy. pull them out.

235
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.034
Lose the music.
Hi. I'm DA Cecile Horton.

236
00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.510
This is my associate.
Ralph Dibny.

237
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.159
DA?
Mm.

238
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.594
How can I help you?

239
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.080
You the field director here?

240
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.994
Assistant. You got a claim or
something I can help you with?

241
00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.879
We're trying to ID a suspect
in a criminal investigation

242
00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.296
and we're going to need
to take a look at the names of

243
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.040
all the people you've assisted
in the last six months.

244
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.794
I can't give you
anyone's names.

245
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.798
You'll need to get
a warrant for that.

246
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.957
Listen up. mister!

247
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.599
Vagger Bance!

248
00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.909
It's Vance Brandon.

249
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.915
You listen to me
when I tell you

250
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.515
that this is my town. baby.

251
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.155
Oh. yeah.
and I can make some real

252
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.993
bad stuff happen for you.

253
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.753
Like. really. really <i>no bueno.</i>

254
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.719
Yeah. well.
this is my country.

255
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.792
which is a lot bigger
than your town.

256
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.679
- That's true.
- So. until you get a warrant.

257
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.479
you're not getting anything.

258
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.314
But wait. did you... Bagger?
Bagger Va... did you...

259
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.834
But this my war face.

260
00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.071
I put my war face on.

261
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.719
That was my war face. Ralph.

262
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.553
It's okay. I... I think
you're just...

263
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.393
you're... you're a little rusty.
that's all.

264
00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.199
Oh. no.
That was way more

265
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.114
than a little rust. Ralph.

266
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.271
I've lost my mojo.

267
00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.918
Oh. that was a...
new mode of travel.

268
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.117
That is what we call
an interdimensional

269
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.554
space-time breach.

270
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.976
It takes a little while
to get used to it.

271
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.836
So. this is
S.T.A.R. Labs. IRL.

272
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.719
Look at that view.

273
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.154
I want to run some tests.

274
00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.920
Make sure everything
is all right with you.

275
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.391
This city is so beautiful.

276
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.796
The sunsets here.

277
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.031
I used to think about them
all the time.

278
00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.793
Hey. maybe you guys
should just

279
00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.149
go for a walk or something.

280
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.675
Try and reconnect first.

281
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.393
Yeah.

282
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.120
Um. why don't we go
for a walk?

283
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.759
Get some fresh air.

284
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.354
I can run my tests later.

285
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.954
I love that plan.

286
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.796
This way.

287
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.833
What's up with you?

288
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.559
Dude. this story
is full of holes.

289
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.800
I'm just trying to fill them.

290
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.593
Nora's story
had holes in them.

291
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.115
and she was only lying to me
'cause she wanted to meet me.

292
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.800
I've appreciated every second
that we've had together so far.

293
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.032
Caitlin just got her dad back.

294
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.156
Let's be happy for her.

295
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.835
Okay. I'm happy.

296
00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.351
So what are we doing first?

297
00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.433
Uh. well.
you're a speedster.

298
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.196
So I was thinking
you could run around the site.

299
00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.033
See if you can find the core.

300
00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.000
I thought. since it's
our first time teaming up.

301
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.919
maybe I could go with you and
we can interview the people

302
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.896
who were here the night
of the Enlightenment together.

303
00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.754
Oh. um. uh...

304
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.990
- Or no.
- No. no. no.

305
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.719
Yeah. it's just...

306
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.793
normally. I interview people
by myself.

307
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.839
Oh. oh. my God.
No. no. It's fine.

308
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.056
It's... I wouldn't ask you
to come speed around the city

309
00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.434
<i>with me or anything like that.</i>

310
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.920
<i>It's fine.
Okay. well. I'll...</i>

311
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.595
No. no. no. You come with me...
I'll come with you. okay.

312
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.955
And we'll interview
the foreman.

313
00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.296
All right. let's not.
How about that?

314
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.516
Look. we have 45 more sites
to search.

315
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.274
Clearly we don't have the time
and clearly we must split up.

316
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.194
So you go search for the core.
You go talk to the foreman.

317
00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.794
I will look for clues.

318
00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.950
And this is how
investigations collapse.

319
00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.679
Hey. babe.

320
00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.480
No. the mother-daughter team-up
is kinda off to a rocky start.

321
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.776
But I don't know.
I think we'll get there.

322
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.870
So?

323
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.792
- The core's not here.
- Well...

324
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.376
why don't you go search
the other sites?

325
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.959
We'll finish up here.

326
00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.996
But. no. you don't want
to do that. do you. no?

327
00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.835
Because. um. you're not here
to investigate. are you?

328
00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.936
No. you're here to spend time
with your mother. right?

329
00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.816
Well. I just thought maybe
we would find something

330
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.752
in common if we worked on
a case together.

331
00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.197
But she's really good at prying
information out of people.

332
00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.351
Believe me. and...

333
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.672
I'm fast on my feet.

334
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.194
I'm gonna go back
to S.T.A.R. labs.

335
00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.953
Hold on. wait.

336
00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.999
I have another plan
to try and find this core.

337
00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.356
It involves you
and your mother.

338
00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.360
So. uh. cherry soda.
Popcorn.

339
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.831
I haven't had a cup of Jitters
coffee in quite a while.

340
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.357
But the thing that
I miss the most was...

341
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.557
Peanut butter
and jelly waffles.

342
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.360
Yeah. Mom used to hate it
when you made those.

343
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.671
Yeah. well.
your mom always wanted

344
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.838
the nicer things in life.
I guess.

345
00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.389
and I was happy with simple.

346
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.837
It's a wonder you two
ever got together.

347
00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.151
- How is she?
<i>- The same.</i>

348
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.754
I don't really see her
that often.

349
00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.638
and when I do.
she's cold as ice.

350
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.632
<i>And now.
after what she did to you...</i>

351
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.439
Oh. well. look.

352
00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.116
she may be a little bit chilly.
but she does love you. Caity.

353
00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.520
It's been really hard
without you.

354
00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.439
I mean. just me and her.

355
00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.000
It was tough.

356
00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.430
- Yeah.
- I've been through a lot.

357
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.319
A lot of that
has to do with me.

358
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.595
- No.
- No. no. listen.

359
00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.592
and... and I wasn't there
for you.

360
00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.717
All these years...
they went by and I...

361
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.473
I want to make it up
to you. Caity.

362
00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.075
I mean. I really should've
been there for you. right?

363
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.072
I mean... and I wish that
I could just...

364
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.072
Dad? Oh. my God.

365
00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.391
Dad. Here. sit.

366
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.960
Oh. my God. Dad?

367
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.680
Dad. Dad.

368
00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.676
Caity?

369
00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.797
Dad? I'm right here.

370
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.991
You saw my disease?

371
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:10.109
Yeah. uh... the dermis
is crystallizing.

372
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.680
And it's spreading.

373
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.315
I ran some tests
while you were unconscious.

374
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.756
You have
a cryogenic malignancy

375
00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.797
<i>and a somatic mutation.</i>

376
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.678
It's not contagious but...

377
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.240
It's rewriting
my genetic code.

378
00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.789
And if it continues.
you could...

379
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.950
Die.

380
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.118
Well. I cured my ALS.

381
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.476
but I created something
even more deadly.

382
00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.071
Every time my emotions spike.
my malignancy spreads.

383
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.715
<i>Like when you're angry
or scared?</i>

384
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.837
<i>I wish I had just left
well enough alone.</i>

385
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.151
For both of us.

386
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.996
Wait. did I have
the genetic marker for ALS too

387
00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.356
and you tried to cure me?

388
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.239
So my powers came from you?

389
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.118
Killer Frost is my cure?

390
00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.395
Killer Frost?

391
00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.312
<i>You may know her
by a different name.</i>

392
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.720
Khione.

393
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.314
Dad. what did you do to me?

394
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.869
I wasn't gonna let
the ALS manifest in you

395
00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.960
<i>like it did in me.</i>

396
00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.034
So you used experimental
cryogenic gene therapy

397
00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.349
on your own daughter?

398
00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.636
I had already done it
on myself.

399
00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.600
Caity. I made alterations
to the treatment.

400
00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.478
I tried to make it
safer. Caity.

401
00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.200
and you started to exhibit
dual personality

402
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.476
soon after I treated you.

403
00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:31.071
So is. um. Khione
or Killer Frost...

404
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.514
is she still around?

405
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.479
Um. she... she's been gone
for a little while.

406
00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.119
but she's still a part of me.

407
00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.474
So where's
your dual personality?

408
00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.711
You and Caitlin carry
the same markers.

409
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.917
you took the same cure.

410
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.957
Where your Khione?

411
00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.191
I never had one.

412
00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.990
That's probably why...

413
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.151
I'm dying and you're not.

414
00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.990
Okay. what if we use
my cells to create a serum

415
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.037
to stabilize your body?

416
00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.896
Um. we have to stop your atoms
from oscillating.

417
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.674
So get your body to
a temperature of absolute zero.

418
00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.114
Caitlin.
that could kill him.

419
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.032
My cells can theoretically

420
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.316
withstand subzero
temperatures

421
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.551
because of
my cryogenic gene therapy.

422
00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:20.271
But the problem is getting
to absolute zero.

423
00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.716
We could use
a laser cooling array.

424
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.314
The DOD just constructed one

425
00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.600
at their site outside of town.

426
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.936
- I could check it out.
- Okay. great.

427
00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.189
I'll get started
on the serum.

428
00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.840
No. no. wait.
Hold on.

429
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.798
We... we can't just hack into

430
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.349
the DOD's $5 billion
security system.

431
00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.830
<i>Cisco.</i>

432
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.391
I just got my dad back.
I can't let him die.

433
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.593
I'll see what I can do.

434
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.320
It's the fifth person
to be sliced up this week.

435
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.837
Take him to OR Three.

436
00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.839
Oh. my God.
What happened to you?

437
00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.389
I'm fine.
I need to stitch that up.

438
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.756
You've got abrasions.
possible internal injuries.

439
00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.035
You keep going out there.

440
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.456
you're gonna be back here
in a body bag.

441
00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.474
You can't be a part of this.

442
00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:30.816
Do you know how many
patients I've seen

443
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.440
come in this hospital
the past four years

444
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.358
because of those metas
out there?

445
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.536
I just treated a man
who was attacked by

446
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.153
a human razor blade.
and you wanna say

447
00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.390
I'm not a part of this?

448
00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.630
Oh. I got that razor meta.

449
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.996
Just like I'll get
the rest of them.

450
00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.276
I know why you're doing this.

451
00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.113
And I know that little girl
laying in a coma

452
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.635
is not my family. but you
are not the only one

453
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.536
whose heart breaks every day
she doesn't wake up.

454
00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:56.033
Grace is the one
that needs help. Not me.

455
00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.999
Now. are you gonna get out
of my way. Doc?

456
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.118
Or are you gonna call security?

457
00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.836
<i>What the heck happened
back there?</i>

458
00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.354
I froze up.

459
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.750
Look.

460
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.314
When I got canned from CCPD.

461
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.156
I fell in with some legally
questionable individuals.

462
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.755
These are some scary.
scary people.

463
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.309
but they all had
one thing in common.

464
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.792
They were all terrified
of Ce-Seal-Your-Fate Horton.

465
00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.519
And I don't believe
for one second that

466
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.513
that woman
has gone anywhere.

467
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.639
Don't ever call me
that again.

468
00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.599
I'm sorry. Geez. I thought
I... I thought we were bonding

469
00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.240
and having a moment. but
I think I crossed the line.

470
00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.595
I didn't really mean to...

471
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.878
I'm kidding. It's a joke.
I was joking.

472
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.474
My gosh. I really got you.

473
00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.120
You didn't have to get
so nervous about it.

474
00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.910
Nervous.
Like the FEMA guy did.

475
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.277
Ralph. I don't think
I froze up back there.

476
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.319
Right. Right. you're...
you're an empath now.

477
00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.869
Your powers let you
experience his fear.

478
00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.838
You're... you're the Deanna Troi
of Team Flash.

479
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.000
I have no idea who that is.
but if he got that scared

480
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.878
when we asked him
about the victims list...

481
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.296
It's because
he's hiding something.

482
00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.754
Yes.

483
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.559
Whoa. whoa. What's. uh.

484
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.597
what's happening with
your nose right now?

485
00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.956
Oh. when I smell a mystery.
that's my thing. I do that.

486
00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.520
- That's nasty.
- It is? You don't...

487
00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.637
- Please stop.
- You don't like it?

song for the last two hours.

493
00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.680
I know. I know.

494
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.519
Are you seriously
making tea right now?

495
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.956
<i>Le thé. Oui.</i>
Right. chamomile.

496

the digestive system.

498
00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.636
Right. because since
I've arrived here.

499
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.518
I've been backed up
like a traffic jam.

500
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.115
That is so disgusting.
Beyond disgusting.

501
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.759
How are we supposed
to investigate

502
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.638
when you're making tea.
Sherloque?

503
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.712
Well. you seem very annoyed.
<i>mademoiselle.</i>

504
00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.031
- No shrap. Sherlock.
- Sherloque.

505
00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.033
Sorry for the language. Mom.

506
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.753
It's okay.

507
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.752
Hey. look.

508
00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.674
There was a carnival the night
the satellite crashed.

509
00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.776
If my dad is right about Cicada
being a father. then maybe...

510
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.080
He might've brought
his kid here.

511
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.270
Exactly.

512
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.416
But. I mean.
I ran all over this place.

513
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.556
There's no core in sight.

516
00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.952
The core fell into
the water.

517
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.759
How you will retrieve it?

518
00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.656
Nora. why don't you create
a vortex like your dad did

519
00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.720
when he fought King Shark?

520
00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.434
Oh. no. or what if we do
what you did with the Hotness?

521
00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.636
You know about that?

522
00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.996
Yeah. of course. I made Papa
Joe tell me everything about

523
00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.753
when my mom was a speedster.

524
00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.638
So how do we do it?

525
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.518
Um...

526
00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.640
Well. you just. um... you run
back and forth in a...

527
00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.995
in a really tight formation.

528
00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.157
And you want to pull the water
up with your heels.

529
00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.296
Okay. right. which would drive
the water away from the shore.

530
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.320
Exactly.

531
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.312
- Schway.
- Yeah.

532
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.914
Do you think I can do it?

533
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.037
Yeah. Nora. you got this.

534
00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.156
Okay.

535
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.080
<i>Four satellites?</i>

536
00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.958
Give them to Cisco.
He's got 'em.

537
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.319
DOD sites? There you go.
All in a day's work for him.

538
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.909
You all think I can
just hack anything. huh?

539
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.032
Yeah.

540
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.913
I can hack anything.

541
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.990
There you are.

542
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.231
Oh!

543
00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.753
I found a path
into the DOD base.

544
00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.776
As long as Cisco can shut down
the interior alarms.

545
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.075
it'll work.

546
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.456
Awesome. I just need
to balance this serum

547
00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.709
and we should be good to go.

548
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.314
Thank you for this. Caity.

549
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.154
I mean. what you're doing
is beyond the call.

550
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.356
Of course. you're my dad.

551
00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.318
I'd do anything for you.

552
00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.232
He's not your dad.

553
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.200
Look familiar?

554
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.630
Cisco.
What are you talking about?

555
00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.758
This is my father.

556
00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.594
I went back to the Tannhauser
black ops site.

557
00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.000
and I picked up a vibe.

558
00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.878
I saw him working in the lab...

559
00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.191
Cisco. your vibes have been
a little problematic...

560
00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.193
I know what I saw. I saw him
standing over the incubator.

561
00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.919
the one he claimed
he had no use for.

562
00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.679
and he was working on this.

563
00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.150
Skin grafts? What does this
have to do with anything?

564
00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.994
This is gonna sound
whacked-out.

565
00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.357
but what if. when your dad
tried to cure his ALS.

566
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.796
it didn't just give him
crystallized skin?

567
00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.237
What if it really did create
that dual personality?

568
00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.392
- This Killer Frost?
- That's who you think this is?

569
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.120
Thomas' alter ego wearing
a copy of his face

570
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.714
made out of these skin grafts?

571
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.395
Yes. I know.
I know it-it sounds...

572
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.995
It sounds absurd.
but I can see where

573
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.879
Mr. Ramon is getting
his hypothesis.

574
00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:42.479
My. uh. cryo-malignancy spread
further than I admitted.

575
00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:47.555
and it's afflicted my face.
my hands. my arms. my chest.

576
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.836
And I created those
skin grafts from stem cells

577
00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.280
that I found in the lab

578
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.352
in order to cover
any further outbreaks.

579
00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.715
You're lying to us.

580
00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.336
- Cisco...
- Caitlyn. you have to see...

581
00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.158
No. you need
to leave us alone.

582
00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.277
- Please...
- Now!

583
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.960
I got it.

584
00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.157
Dude. Hey dude.
we need to talk.

585
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.074
Why? I thought that dramatic
confrontation worked perfectly.

586
00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.152
- We all want to help Caitlin.
- Oh. do you?

587
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.216
Yeah. I want Caitlin to have
a chance to be with her father.

588
00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.000
Just like Nora got
the chance to be with you?

589
00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.633
See. this is your problem.

590
00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.677
You think that this is just
another perfect

591
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.752
father-daughter pairing.
reunited.

592
00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.559
I'm not blinded
by my feelings.

593
00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.136
Well. they're not helping
you see any clearer.

594
00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.356
You gotta stop thinking
about this like Nora's dad

595
00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.591
and start thinking about it
like a CSI.

596
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.070
Please?

597
00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.595
Don't do it for me.
Do it for her.

598
00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.631
Didn't I tell you
to get lost?

599
00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.439
Yes. you did.
Thanks for that.

600
00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.352
Gave us time
to pull your file.

601
00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.558
You don't have any priors.
but I did find about

602
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.711
a dozen outstanding parking
tickets. though.

603
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.200
Oh. no.

604
00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.953
For. uh. what was it?
It was. um...

605
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.191
Oh. yeah. a Lamborghini.

606
00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.034
Hmm. Vroom. vroom.

607
00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:14.160
How does a civil servant afford
a $200.000 car?

608
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.959
Okay.
I'm calling security.

609
00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.040
Please do.

610
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.040
I can't wait to report a case
of insurance fraud.

611
00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.296
You've been telling citizens
their claims have been denied

612
00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.959
and then pocketing the cash
for yourself

613
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.160
when the government pays up.

614
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.760
That's why this FEMA center's
emptier than Grandma's whiskey

615
00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.035
at a Dibny Christmas dinner.

616
00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.157
You can't prove any of this.

617
00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.720
Try me.

618
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.798
That's everyone.

619
00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.031
Names. addresses. location
the night of the crash.

620
00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.158
So... this is gonna stay
between us?

621
00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.920
You've been profiting
off of innocent victims.

622
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.639
You know I put a call
into your superiors

623
00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.871
in D.C. 20 minutes ago.

624
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.031
I got my groove back. Vancey.

625
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.874
That's how I know it's you
that's scared and not me.

626
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.231
Now there's the old
Ce-Seal-Your-Fate Horton

627
00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.840
- we all know and love.
- Vroom. vroom.

628
00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.070
Hmm.

629
00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.073
Hey.

630
00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.800
If you came to defend Cisco.
please don't bother.

631
00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.997
He just cares about you.

632
00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.336
Come on. don't you think
I would know

633
00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.317
if that wasn't
actually my father?

634
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.269
You too? Really?

635
00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:14.195
Listen. I wanted to believe
that that's your dad

636
00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.636
and that he's a good guy
because I want you to be happy.

637
00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.030
But I don't... I don't know.

638
00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.998
Maybe I haven't
been seeing clearly.

639
00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.549
There is a lot about this guy's
story that doesn't add up.

640
00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.314
This guy?
This guy is my father.

641
00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.596
He's the man who held me
when I had chickenpox.

642
00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.552
Who told me I could be
anything I wanted to

643
00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.592
and made me believe it.

644
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.559
So please stop treating him
like he's a criminal.

645
00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.393
Okay.

646
00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.796
You know how estranged
I am from my mother

647
00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.794
and how empty I felt
without Killer Frost.

648
00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:47.351
He is the only family
that I have left.

649
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:50.911
But Caitlin. that's not true.
We're your family too.

650
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.993
And we're only asking you
to keep an open mind

651
00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.077
because we care about you.

652
00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.753
Especially Cisco.

653
00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.400
If it'll make you
feel better.

654
00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.680
you can ask him
your questions.

655
00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.916
but only after
I give him the serum.

656
00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.718
<i>- What's wrong?</i>
- Oh. my God.

657
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.916
What?

658
00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.520
If I give this serum
to a human.

659
00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.069
it will suppress
their malignant side.

660
00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.551
But if I give it to
a cryogenic meta-human.

661
00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.996
it will permanently suppress
their human side.

662
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.719
If that's your father's
alter ego...

663
00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.120
He's trying to wipe out
my dad.

664
00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.471
He needed your cells
to make the serum.

665
00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.433
"Caitlin. come find me."

666
00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.354
Caity.

667
00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.476
What's going on?

668
00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:45.519
Dad. why?

669
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:50.550
Well... I guess.
as you're all here...

670
00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.798
You have such smart
friends. Caity.

671
00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.793
That frozen liquid
in your lungs

672
00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.679
<i>is gonna be turning
into tiny icicles.</i>

673
00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.559
Making it very difficult
for you to breathe.

674
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.030
<i>But no worries.</i>

675
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.430
You'll pass out soon.

676
00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.511
Caitlin. Hey!

677
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.115
Caitlin. wake up.

678
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.476
- Hey. are you okay?
- Yeah. yeah. I'm okay.

679
00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.114
Um. is my dad gone?

680
00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.634
He took the serum.

681
00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:43.915
This is all my fault.

682
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.832
I was so excited
to have my dad back

683
00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.480
that I... I couldn't see
who he really was.

684
00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.358
I owe you both an apology.

685
00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:53.558
Hey. it's okay.

686
00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.518
We'll get him.

687
00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.273
<i>Hey. guys. get in here.</i>

688
00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.511
Come on.

689
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.035
Guys. please.

690
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.395
- What?
- He's at the DOD site.

691
00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.516
Look.

692
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.600
That building's 7 below?

693
00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.136
Look at the temperature.
Look at it drop.

694
00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.256
He initiated
the negative array

695
00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.714
but didn't seal it.

696
00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.911
The room is -7.
but the array is -100.

697
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.096
That thing's
so freaking cold.

698
00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.176
it's freezing
the whole building.

699
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.296
Wait. at this rate.
in 5 minutes.

700
00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.232
the temperature will be
- 460 degrees.

701
00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.320
AKA absolute zero.

702
00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.400
At which point. he can
inject himself with my serum.

703
00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.875
And turn himself into
a full-on icicle.

704
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.679
Icicle. that's...
not the time.

705
00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:25.936
<i>- We gotta go.</i>
- Let's do it.

706
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.714
Hey. what...
what about your hands?

707
00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:32.760
You're my friend. my family.
I'm going.

708
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.600
Almost there.

709
00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.075
Ugh... Flash.

710
00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:53.551
Don't you realize
that speed and cold don't mix?

711
00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.439
<i>This machine is capable
of producing isotopes</i>

712
00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.752
that can freeze carbon dioxide.

713
00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.832
You can't run in here.

714
00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.156
More superheroes to freeze.

715
00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.709
<i>The array's at -220.
You have one minute.</i>

716
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.076
You people are not
as smart as I thought.

717
00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.230
Guys. what's happening?

718
00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.536
The temperature in the room
is dropping.

719
00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.760
Everyone's so cold. their atoms
are hitting near stasis.

720
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.599
Why... why can't I see
my breath?

721
00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:22.991
It's too cold.
There's no moisture in the air.

722
00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.840
Cisco. are you okay?

723
00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:29.674
No. At least
I can't feel anything.

724
00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.911
<i>Guys. the array's
at -350 degrees.</i>

725
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.673
He's gonna be able to go
full Icicle soon.

726
00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:35.960
Come on.

727
00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.316
- Forty-five seconds.
- What do we do?

728
00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.516
Lightning.

729
00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.056
<i>Use your lightning
to counter the cold</i>

730
00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.656
and maybe you can warm up
enough to stop him.

731
00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.399
We've been trying to do it
this whole time.

732
00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.675
It's too cold.

733
00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.991
I'm literally fr... freezing.

734
00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.719
<i>399. you have 30 seconds.</i>

735
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.856
Your temperature
is dropping too quickly.

736
00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.416
You're gonna go into
hypothermic shock soon.

737
00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.760
But not Caitlin.

738
00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.560
Look. Caitlin's body
temperature is normal.

739
00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.994
<i>Caitlin. you must be immune.</i>

740
00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.594
But Killer Frost is gone.

741
00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.956
Well. clearly. she's not.

742
00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.235
<i>Guys. 400 degrees.</i>

743
00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.720
We got 20 seconds.

744
00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.235
Caitlin. you can do it.

745
00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.959
Just concentrate.

746
00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.590
Dad!

747
00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.394
Please.
I know you're in there.

748
00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.994
Don't do this.

749
00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.720
Do you think Thomas
can hear you. Caity?

750
00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:26.637
Thomas hasn't been able to hear
anything for a very long time.

751
00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.520
- What is that?
- 460 degrees. We're too late.

752
00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.353
<i>He beat us.</i>

753
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.474
No!

754
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.560
<i>My daughter.
You've returned!</i>

755
00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.356
You're not my family.

756
00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.635
They are.

757
00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:56.360
You only gave a damn about me
because you wanted that serum.

758
00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.636
But I... I can share it
with you.

759
00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.790
Just imagine.

760
00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:03.237
The two of us. free to be
ourselves without fear.

761
00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.913
You are strong.

762
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.560
We can be even stronger
together.

763
00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.519
I'm strong because I have
people in my life

764
00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.478
who actually care about me.

765
00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.075
Do you?

766
00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.514
No!

767
00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.240
No!

768
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.751
Caity?

769
00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.315
- Dad?
- You found me?

770
00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.999
Temperature's rising.

771
00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.594
What's happening?
Is everyone okay?

772
00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.637
<i>- I think so.
- A little help?</i>

773
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.632
Get Cisco.

774
00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.279
Oh. yeah.
That's good.

775
00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.397
Yeah.

776
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.675
Okay.

777
00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.792
My dad.

778
00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.320
Our dad.

779
00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:24.078
He was here. but... I lost him.

780
00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.994
We'll get him back.
Together.

781
00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.560
You're not alone anymore.

782
00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.754
Neither am I.

783
00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.632
No cold signatures
in the area.

784
00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.916
Snow Country for Old Men
must be miles away.

785
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.696
'cause he sure as hell
isn't in Central City.

786
00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.279
Well. we have to find him.

787
00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.920
I mean. Icicle wouldn't have
gone to all this trouble

788
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.595
to kill my Dad if there wasn't
a piece of him still left.

789
00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.070
We'll find him.

790
00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.312
All the things I vibed. they
weren't memories of your dad.

791
00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.073
They were of his alter ego.

792
00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.959
My dad was trying
to protect me.

793
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.351
You know what?
My mom probably was too.

794
00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.909
<i>I mean. she was just trying
to keep me safe.</i>

795
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.276
All this time. I thought
she was the villain.

796
00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.198
How could I not see
it was him?

797
00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.351
Hey. don't beat yourself up.

798
00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.557
Thawne. Zolomon.

799
00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.836
We see the good in people.
That's just who we are.

800
00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.799
I hope that never changes.

801
00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.917
There's something else
you guys should see.

802
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:39.070
All this time. we've been
trying to figure out

803
00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.038
how Killer Frost disappeared.

804
00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.477
but we've been looking at it
all wrong.

805
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:47.234
We've been thinking DeVoe
used Melting Point's powers.

806
00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.198
that he changed your meta DNA

807
00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.556
and removed Killer Frost
from you.

808
00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.878
But tonight. you proved
that she's still a part of you.

809
00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.873
So what caused her to leave?

810
00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.794
DeVoe used a different set
of powers.

811
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.349
- Brainstorm.
- Brainstorm.

812
00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.456
All that he did
was create a mental block.

813
00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.336
One you broke through tonight.
so you can do that again.

814
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.717
You just gotta learn how.

815
00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.110
I think it's time
we reintroduce an old friend.

816
00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.875
Harry's mental activity
dampener.

817
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.878
It'll help me hear her.

818
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.400
<i>That's right.</i>

819
00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.711
It's my hope that
the more you use it.

820
00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.996
the more you connect with her.

821
00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.515
Eventually. you won't
need it anymore.

822
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.876
Thank you.

823
00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.476
<i>Guys. we need you
in the Speed Lab.</i>

824
00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.957
All right.
We'll leave you to it.

825
00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.230
<i>Hey. stranger.</i>

826
00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.879
Hey.

827
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.555
<i>Well. we sure have
a lot to talk about.</i>

828
00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.829
Oh! Sally's heart!

829
00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.917
You brought it back.

830
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.390
We did. thanks to these two

831
00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.517
and their deductive abilities.

832
00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:12.557
And our
tidal-wave-breaking skills.

833
00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.816
- Right?
- Like mother. like daughter.

834
00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.069
Mm-hmm.

835
00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.629
Uh. is it safe
for this to be here?

836
00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.280
Yeah. a little dark matter
never hurt anybody.

837
00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.794
What?

838
00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.553
We've seen
this puzzle piece before.

839
00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:27.350
Our satellite giveth.
and now we must taketh away.

840
00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.636
I think we can
finally do that.

841
00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.816
We got a list from FEMA of
everyone who reported injuries

842
00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.040
<i>the night
of the Enlightenment.</i>

843
00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.656
None of them matched
Cicada's description.

844
00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:35.796
<i>But there were three kids</i>

845
00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:38.111
who were hit by pieces
of shrapnel from the satellite.

846
00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.351
Two of them are twins
whose father is deceased.

847
00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.840
<i>Third is a ten-year-old girl.</i>

848
00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.593
by the name of Grace Gibbons.

849
00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.240
So if my dad's right
and Cicada's a father. then...

850
00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.676
We may have just found
his daughter.

851
00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.834
Orlin?

852
00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.240
Orlin.

853
00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.000
After I fix up your side.
I'm gonna patch up your chest.

854
00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.713
No.

855
00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:35.432
It's making me stronger.

856
00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.520
<i>Greg. move your head.</i>
