00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.829
<i>My name is Barry Allen.</i>

2
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.037
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.190
<i>To the outside world.</i>

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.192
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist.</i>

5
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.595
<i>But secretly. with the help</i>

6
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.319
<i>of my friends
at S.T.A.R. Labs.</i>

7
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.518
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

8
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.616
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help.</i>

9
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.871
<i>she changed the present.</i>

10
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.475
<i>and now our world is more
dangerous than ever.</i>

11
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.870
<i>and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.277
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

13
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.591
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

14
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.637
<i>So what are you
going to do with him?</i>

15
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.376
<i>I think our time would be
better served</i>

16
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.720
learning how to cure him.

17
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.314
You should really talk
to Dr. Lamden.

18
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.198
<i>Grodd's attacking him
psychically.</i>

19
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.240
<i>He's paralyzed.</i>

20
00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:42.709
<i>Human weak.</i>

21
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.837
We could make
a meta-human cure.

22
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.056
There's gotta be something
we could do outside the box.

23
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.754
<i>You shouldn't go
to your office.</i>

24
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.910
- Not right now.
- Why?

25
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.798
<i>How many times
has this happened?</i>

26
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.519
52.

27
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.056
If I want to stop Cicada.
I can't be so precious

28
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.536
about getting
The Flash's hands dirty.

29
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.472
Sometimes the ends
justify the means.

30
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.517
I get that now.

31
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.391
Can't move.

32
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.478
Ladies and gentlemen.
we finally have our hands

33
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.439
on the meta-human cure.

34
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.397
Cool. cool.
It's not like I spent weeks

35
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.039
in the frozen tundra
or anything.

36
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.034
No. no. no.
I think that just people are

37
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.271
waiting for
the inevitable "but"

38
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.272
that follows
such a big statement.

39
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.592
Mmm. no. it's done.
and thanks to Caitlin.

40
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.713
we even have a way to deliver
our silver bullet.

41
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.554
so no. no "buts."

42
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.154
I believe
there is a big "but" coming.

43
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.278
But we need to test
the cure on a meta-human.

44
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.680
<i>Et voilà.</i>
There it is.

45
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.558
What we need is to save

46
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.279
the metas that
Cicada is targeting.

47
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.296
because he's not gonna stop
killing innocent people.

48
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.075
- Is the cure dangerous?
- Well. it's an untested serum

49
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.760
that alters biology
on a cellular level.

50
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.957
so until we try it out
on someone.

51
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.076
we have no way
of knowing.

52
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.816
When we started
working on the cure.

53
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.878
we decided that it would always
be a choice. not a weapon.

54
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.753
so all we need
is a volunteer.

55
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.877
Well. there's quite
a conundrum. right?

56
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.160
A meta-human volunteer when
the meta-humans in this city

57
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.112
have been chased away by us
or killed by Cicada

58
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.715
or incarcerated
at Iron Heights Prison. so...

59
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.235
Nobody from either group
is gonna volunteer.

60
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.471
No. these criminals
are not going to relinquish

61
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.954
their powers. although...

62
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.759
There's gotta be
somebody somewhere.

63
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.833
Yes. on another Earth.

64
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.310
Oh. I'll call Harry. see if
there's anybody from Earth-2

65
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.576
- who wants to volunteer.
- Yes.

66
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.876
Not really what
I was suggesting.

67
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.376
Hold on.
you don't have to call Harry.

68
00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.880
Wait. why not?

69
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.191
Because there's already
a meta here from Earth-2.

70
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.637
one who might not
want his powers...

71
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.237
although it might be pretty
difficult to talk to him.

72
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.039
King Shark...

73
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.679
you really think
you can cure him?

74
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.910
That's the idea.

75
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.276
Oh. Lyla. this is. um...

76
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.031
my daughter. Nora.

77
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.077
- Your daughter?
- Yeah.

78
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.391
- I'm from...
- The future. I'm guessing.

79
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.709
Weird. right?

80
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.936
No weirder than
waking up one day

81
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.476
to find out that your son
used to be your daughter.

82
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.799
So. why King Shark?

83
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.157
Dark matter levels vary
from meta-human to meta-human.

84
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.472
but Shay Lamden's case
is the most extreme we've seen.

85
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.916
so we think if we could reverse
the effects of a high level

86
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.596
- mutation like his...
- You can help all meta-humans.

87
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.196
Look. we know King Shark
has limited speech.

88
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.830
but we're wondering.
could we try and talk to him?

89
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.776
If we're gonna do this.
we're gonna need his permission.

90
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.393
Well. you're in luck. Cisco.

91
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.949
Lately.
he's been quite talkative.

92
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.517
<i>Look at these pictures.</i>

93
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.399
- So peaceful.
- Mm.

94
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.439
So beautiful.

95
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.997
- So peaceful.
- It is. isn't it?

96
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.596
You know. I never understood
why Wally went there.

97
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.876
- Now I do.
- Well. it makes me wonder.

98
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.350
I mean. is my baby brother
ever coming back from Tibet?

99
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.036
Well. all I can say
is that he is more at ease

100
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.755
- than he has ever been.
- Hm.

101
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.116
And if that means
he wants to stay away from...

102
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.999
The crazy
that is Central City.

103
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.117
then. you know what?
So be it.

104
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.634
Yeah.

105
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.872
Well. I am glad
that you're back. Dad.

106
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.156
We're all glad
that you're back.

107
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.754
Mmm.

108
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.355
Even Captain Singh is glad
that you're back.

109
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.635
- Wha...
- I'll get it.

110
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.712
No. no. no.
No. you will not.

111
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.836
You will not.

112
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.200
You have been on
crying baby duty

113
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.993
for far too long. Joe West.

114
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.880
So happy you're back.

115
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.713
All right.
all right.

116
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.677
Are we ever gonna talk
about this couch you bought?

117
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.911
Another day. Joe.
Another day.

118
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.354
Very expensive.

119
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.954
I mean. it's nice.
Listen.

120
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.117
So. Cecile...
Mm-hmm.

121
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.556
Has brought me up to speed.

122
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.791
Cicada... been very busy.

123
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.117
Yeah. well...

124
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.750
You know. Team Flash will
figure out a way to beat him.

125
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.516
But Jonesy was helping him
right under our nose.

126
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.757
and that got me to thinking.

127
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.117
Cicada's eluded capture
for so long

128
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.760
that I'm thinking that

129
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.991
he's still getting help
from somebody.

130
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.873
I want more coffee.

131
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.474
I'm gonna make
some more coffee.

132
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.553
Yeah. I'll bring you
a fresh cup.

133
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.475
Normally we don't bring in
outside help. but we got wind

134
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.920
that the top ichthyologist in
the country was doing research

135
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.957
on cases just like
King Shark's.

136
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.350
Actually.
I think you may know her.

137
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.352
Dr. Lamden?

138
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.954
Are you working
for A.R.G.U.S. now?

139
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.191
Couldn't say no.
And please. call me Tanya.

140
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.714
What about
Nautilus Laboratories?

141
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.235
Director Michaels offered me
the opportunity to work

142
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.789
with another Shay Lamden.
one afflicted with the same

143
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.997
dark matter anomaly
as my late husband.

144
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.549
only this Shay system
was causing

145
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.950
his neural pathways to regress.

146
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.032
I'm teaching him how
to communicate effectively.

147
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.476
Are you saying his mind
is becoming more shark-like?

148
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.950
It was. but not anymore.

149
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.838
I stopped the regression
of King Shark's mind

150
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.718
using a cerebral interface

151
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.792
that stimulates
his neural outputs.

152
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.837
I call it a telepathic crown.

153
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.196
Kinda like the
M.A.D. 2.0 we built.

154
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.280
That's brilliant.

155
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.432
My husband.
the Shay Lamden of Earth-1.

156
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.000
was a wonderful man.

157
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.437
Now. I have the chance to help
another Earth's Shay Lamden.

158
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.399
by giving him back
his human mind.

159
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.358
And since Shay's current state

160
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.080
requires him to be
in the water more.

161
00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.311
these earbuds allow me
to hear him

162
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.232
underwater and vice versa.

163
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.437
The telepathic crown
allows Tanya to get through

164
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.354
to King Shark and curb
his violent behavior.

165
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.591
Can we use the crown
to talk to him?

166
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.478
Yes. but why?

167
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.679
We think we can
make him human again.

168
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.576
It's taken a lot of work. but
we think we figured out a way

169
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.557
to transform
dark matter-infused cells

170
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.120
back to their non-meta state.

171
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.271
Now. all we need to do
is test it.

172
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.750
so we came looking
for a volunteer.

173
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.997
That could really work?

174
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.673
So. can we ask him?

175
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.154
Shay. a team from
S.T.A.R. Labs is here.

176
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.596
They have something
you may want...

177
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.674
a meta-cure
for your condition.

178
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.275
Trust me.
their preliminary analysis

179
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.750
on reversing meta-gene
transfigurations

180
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.799
proves there is a strong chance
it could work.

181
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.190
especially in
ichthyological prospects.

182
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.350
No. I'm not just showing off.

183
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.636
It's their research.

184
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.519
Shay has
a wonderful sense of humor.

185
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.436
So. are we supposed to call
him King Shark or Shay?

186
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.991
Yes. I'm still here.
Uh-huh.

187
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.390
I agree.

188
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.079
Okay.

189
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.754
You believe
this cure could help?

190
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.752
Yeah.

191
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.875
Where do we begin?

192
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.120
This is Agent Michaels.

193
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.159
I need every available soldier
at the aquarium now!

194
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.312
- Dad?
- I'm fine.

195
00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.835
W-What was all that feedback?
I thought he was under control.

196
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.920
I don't know.

197
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.117
Nothing like that
has ever happened before.

198
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.471
Maybe his neuroregression
finally reached the point

199
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.756
where the crown
could no longer affect him.

200
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.320
Shay could be lost forever.

201
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.880
No. no. no.
We don't know that.

202
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.753
Why don't you come to
S.T.A.R. Labs with us?

203
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.400
We can use the M.A.D. 2.0
to boost the crown's efficiency.

204
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.076
We need to find King Shark
before he hurts anyone.

205
00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.516
A.R.G.U.S. backup
protocols have been activated.

206
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.114
but King Shark
could be anywhere.

207
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.536
We'll re-task the
S.T.A.R. Labs satellite

208
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.960
to work in circuit
with A.R.G.U.S.

209
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.959
What's on your mind?

210
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.554
Just wondering
if we need to rethink

211
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.438
how we're going to catch him.

212
00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.274
Stop. that did not happen.

213
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.073
Yes. it did.

214
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.712
Look. my lips went numb.
and then they swelled up

215
00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.759
so bad it looked like
I had plastic surgery.

216
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.718
- What did Wally do?
- He laughed. of course.

217
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.393
The baby laughed.

218
00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.520
At least now I know I'm
allergic to Szechuan peppers.

219
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.480
Dad. do you mind
if I work here today. actually?

220
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.552
Might give us some time
to catch up.

221
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.997
Well. you know I'm never
gonna turn that down. so...

222
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.074
Uh. but. Cecile tells me
that you have

223
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.800
a fancy new office?

224
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.076
Yeah. yeah. it's just.
you know. the plumbing

225
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.913
is really lousy and
I can't have water

226
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.229
dripping on my laptop. right?

227
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.518
Well. hey. uh. the guy that
expanded our guest bath...

228
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.751
he did a really great job
and he's really affordable.

229
00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.639
- Let me give you his number.
- No. Dad. it's fine. really.

230
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.677
Iris. if you don't
take care of this quickly.

231
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.035
it could snowball.

232
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.516
Here.
Let me just send it to you.

233
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.080
Okay. yeah.
Yeah.

234
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.914
Actually. yeah. you know what?
That's a great idea.

235
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.536
Why don't you send it to me
and I'll head over there

236
00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.791
and see what I can do.

237
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.195
- Thanks. Dad.
- Okay.

238
00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.839
Love you.

239
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.957
Love you more.

240
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.554
So. if we wanna
boost the crown's powers.

241
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.115
we gotta get it
to talk to the M.A.D. 2.0.

242
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.192
What about
a logarithmic code?

243
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.840
Exactly.
You see. this is why we need

244
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.674
more scientists on the team.

245
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.319
Shay tells me that
all the time.

246
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.636
Well. the guy knows
what he's talking about.

247
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.712
All right. so.
why don't you use

248
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.837
my workstation.
and I'll get this going.

249
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.160
- Fascinating. right?
- Yeah. it should be.

250
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.515
It's the merging
of technology

251
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.193
and human consciousness.

252
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.033
And shark.
but no. no. no.

253
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.079
I'm referring to your
relationship with Shay Lamden.

254
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.436
What do you mean.
"relationship"?

255
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.114
The way your posture relaxes
when you're speaking of him

256
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.536
and the way
your voice modulates...

257
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.076
- it suggests a familiarity...
- Hm.

258
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.800
Or something more.

259
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.634
We're both marine biologists.
so we have a lot in common.

260
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.475
I guess you could say
we've grown very close.

261
00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.153
But he's just my patient.

262
00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.640
Oh. of course.

263
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.997
Look at that.
We have liftoff.

264
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.640
They are actually talking.
You see?

265
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.996
I knew these two crazy kids
were gonna make it work.

266
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.952
They aren't just synching up.

267
00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.470
The M.A.D. 2.0 is acting
like an antenna.

268
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.791
amplifying the
crown's psychic signal

269
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.236
beyond anything
I could have imagined.

270
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.516
We heard geek screaming.
How are things going in here?

271
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.432
I just need to synch
the helmet to my earbuds.

272
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.080
- and we're good to go.
- Left that in the cortex.

273
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.073
in the main console.
by the monitor to the left.

274
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.719
You know what?

275
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.076
Come with me.
I'll show you.

276
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.800
- Great work. Cisco.
- Oh. well. takes a village.

277
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.200
But every village
needs a genius

278
00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.192
and that's me. so thank you.

279
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.511
Now we just have to find
King Shark and talk him down.

280
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.195
Why don't we get the cure
injector to Caitlin

281
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.456
and make sure it's ready to go?

282
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.393
Well. remember.
we gotta talk to him first.

283
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.551
Right.

284
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.836
<i>We got a hit on King
Shark. He's at the wharf.</i>

285
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.639
Caitlin.
are you sure he's here?

286
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.514
Oh. he's there.

287
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.030
He's heading
straight for you.

288
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.111
Nora. you're up.

289
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.554
Done.

290
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.472
Okay. systems are synched.

291
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.120
Shay?
It's me. Tanya.

292
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.510
These people are
only here to help you.

293
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.239
<i>Please listen to them.</i>

294
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.437
It's okay.

295
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.079
I think it's working.

296
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.994
I think you're right.

297
00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.754
Let's ask him...

298
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.911
Shay. stop!
Please.

299
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.236
Please. I don't know
what's wrong with him.

300
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.074
<i>Barry?</i>

301
00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.551
<i>Guys. what's happening?
Where's Shay?</i>

302
00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.718
Shay?

303
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.759
What is it?

304
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.990
What's going on?

305
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.436
<i>Is Shay okay?</i>

306
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.153
He's human again.

307
00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.351
Where am I?
Who are you?

308
00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.576
- Hey. hey. hey.
- No. enough!

309
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.512
- Just get off me!
- It's okay.

310
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.716
They're friends.

311
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.910
Tanya.

312
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.151
Yeah. it's... it's me.

313
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.111
I'm... me?

314
00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.237
How?

315
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.152
We call it the cure.

316
00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.438
It's a serum that suppresses
dark matter in meta-humans.

317
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.074
You're the first person
to take it.

318
00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.914
Well. except
you didn't take it.

319
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.232
We. um. we gave it to you.

320
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.352
My... my head
is still swirling around.

321
00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.717
Are you saying
I'm human again?

322
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.678
Forever?

323
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.638
Almost.

324
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.792
We developed a cure to work on
the human part of a meta-human.

325
00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.840
The animal part of your brain
fought back a little bit.

326
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.759
There's still some dark matter
in your pituitary gland.

327
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.236
but with this new data.
we should be able to

328
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.836
address the cure and the
next dose should be permanent.

329
00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.151
Monsieur Lamden.
I should introduce myself.

330
00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.118
Sherloque Wells.
You've probably heard of me.

331
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.159
I have a question
I've been debating in my brain.

332
00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:04.234
What drives the King Shark?

333
00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.633
Is it the shark.
or is it the man?

334
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.896
If you're asking should
I be held accountable

335
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.596
for my actions.
my answer is simple.

336
00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.353
Yes. I should.

337
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.435
I don't remember
how many people I hurt.

338
00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.196
or who.
but that's no excuse.

339
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.680
What do you remember?

340
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.872
Fragments.
Glimpses.

341
00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.960
One day. I was a scientist.
The next. I was trapped

342
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.151
in that body and
everything felt heightened.

343
00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.471
like my emotions
were on steroids.

344
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.560
And the rage...
there was so much rage.

345
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.336
That makes sense.
A shark's amygdala triggers

346
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.511
a huge emotional response
when it feels attacked.

347
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.195
Perhaps that's why
you escaped today.

348
00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.913
You were frightened.

349
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.072
I don't know.
Today felt different.

350
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.352
I don't remember much before
I started using Tanya's crown.

351
00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.760
but since then.

352
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.594
my mind and memory
have been much clearer.

353
00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.071
And I especially remember the
kindness that you showed me.

354
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.554
What...

355
00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.431
What happened?

356
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.631
The dark matter in
his system is replicating.

357
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.633
Tanya. I'm sorry.

358
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.354
Shay. I'm sorry.
but until this is over.

359
00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.955
we can't let you
leave S.T.A.R. Labs.

360
00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.680
Call me as soon as the cure

361
00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.096
is ready to inject him
a second time.

362
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.589
We have to know if this works.

363
00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.920
- Barry?
- Yeah?

364
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.496
When you said
you wanted me to call you

365
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.352
it was so that
we could ask Shay

366
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.874
if he wants to
take the cure. right?

367
00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.553
- Caitlin...
- 'Cause you know.

368
00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.776
out in the field.
you didn't really give him

369
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:06.870
much of a choice.

370
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.120
But that was kinda hard to do

371
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.799
when King Shark
had you dead to rights.

372
00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.031
We had a way
of communicating with him.

373
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.360
and you barely
gave that a shot.

374
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.536
And we could have
tried again.

375
00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.075
I saved you. man.
What did you want me to do?

376
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.696
- Risk your life?
- That's not the point.

377
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.200
It should be.
We're a team.

378
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.496
We're supposed to have
each other's backs.

379
00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.352
And we agreed. as a team.

380
00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.136
to wait for his permission.
but you didn't even do that.

381
00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.160
And look what happened.

382
00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.240
You're alive.

383
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.040
and Shay seems
to like being human.

384
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.237
so that's a win-win.

385
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.193
Is that what you think
a hero does?

386
00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.998
Forces other people to do
what you want them to do?

387
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.993
He was gonna eat you. Cisco.

388
00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.199
What was I supposed to do?

389
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:48.354
We agreed that the cure
would never be used as a weapon.

390
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.073
Tell me something.

391
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.157
Did you change your mind
in the moment.

392
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.993
or was this always
part of the plan?

393
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:10.031
<i>♪♪ If I could turn back time.
I would do it all again ♪♪</i>

394
00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.236
Dad?

395
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.199
I went by your office

396
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.431
to talk to you.

397
00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.800
Dad. look.
I. um...

398
00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.792
Don't.
Don't try it.

399
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:28.830
I heard about this crazy
time loop you all got stuck in.

400
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.640
Cisco and Nora told me

401
00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.313
what happened
in every version.

402
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.080
and although
I don't remember any of them.

403
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.311
just knowing what did happen...

404
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.471
You weren't scared?

405
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.358
I don't know.

406
00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.033
I mean.
I broke into Cicada's home.

407
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.834
Dad. I fought him.

408
00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.311
And as terrifying
as that was. I mean.

409
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.278
at least I could
react to it. you know?

410
00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.716
But now... now that he knows
who I am. who my family is.

411
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.360
I mean. he could show up
at any moment.

412
00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.113
I just. I...

413
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.271
- I feel...
- Powerless.

414
00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.114
Yeah. I just...

415
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:08.080
I don't know.
I can't go back there.

416
00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.994
Okay. get up.

417
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.514
Dad. I just told you...

418
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.353
I don't want to go back there.
you know?

419
00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.676
I'm not taking you there.

420
00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.989
Then where?

421
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.117
Someplace where
I can show you

422
00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.113
how powerful you really are.

423
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.512
Pack it up.
Come on.

424
00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.637
We gotta talk.

425
00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.995
Don't you know you shouldn't

426
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.536
interrupt others
while they're brooding?

427
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.836
Trying to get
my Oliver Queen on here.

428
00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.071
I ran some more tests
on Shay.

429
00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.277
The reason he doesn't remember
anything that happened

430
00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.716
this morning is because he
experienced a severe brain wave

431
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.359
disruption in his frontal lobe.

432
00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.636
That's the feedback
that we all heard.

433
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.474
So. that's why he snapped on us

434
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.040
like it was
<i>Jaws: The Revenge?</i>

435
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.157
A frontal lobe that
compromised would of course

436
00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:01.120
result in lack of control
over emotions and judgment.

437
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.477
So you think maybe the
crown might have done this?

438
00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.029
No. that's the thing.
The crown is not the problem.

439
00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.736
The way the neurotransmitters
work in this device

440
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.989
never would have caused that.

441
00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.520
So what you're saying is

442
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.096
the telepathic crown
was working the whole time?

443
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.713
Yes. so that
begs the question.

444
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.077
what caused King Shark
to go berserk?

445
00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.358
Guys. hey.
Um...

446
00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.719
I just wanted
to apologize for earlier.

447
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.235
I was definitely too harsh.

448
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.276
No way.

449
00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.557
Caitlin.

450
00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.873
Hello. Flash.

451
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.476
Cisco's cerebral scan
is clear.

452
00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.552
Mine is as well.
We are both back to normal.

453
00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.512
No more strings on us.

454
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.597
Killer Frost says
she's sorry for that ice blast.

455
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.114
That was Grodd. too.

456
00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.680
Now she's ready
for some payback.

457
00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.160
Yeah. me too.

458
00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.879
Do we have a 20
on our Simian Svengali?

459
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.553
Data and company
are working on it.

460
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.074
but Grodd's psychic abilities

461
00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.992
are helping him
conceal his location.

462
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.355
so he could be anywhere by now.

463
00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.239
I thought every
square inch of A.R.G.U.S.

464
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.710
was supposed to be
power dampened 24 hours a day.

465
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.800
It is.

466
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.714
Then how does
an 800-pound gorilla escape?

467
00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.598
Let me show you.

468
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.514
I went through
our security footage.

469
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.399
This is from the night
of May 22nd. 2018.

470
00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.358
- That's the night...
- Of the Enlightenment.

471
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.919
DeVoe's dark matter wave
took down all tech

472
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.116
in the surrounding areas.

473
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.351
Luckily.
our generators kicked in.

474
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.796
- But not for a second.
- One second.

475
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.314
That's all Grodd needed

476
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.240
to psychically implant
instructions in a guard.

477
00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.839
Instructions
to secretly shut down

478
00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.718
the power dampeners
in his cell.

479
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.917
and find out any other
information he needed to know.

480
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.832
So that's why
King Shark flipped out?

481
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.957
Because Grodd was trying
to mind control him?

482
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.360
Likely as a distraction.

483
00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.399
Grodd's only ever
controlled human minds before.

484
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.597
He must have had a hard time
controlling King Shark

485
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.273
because of the animal part
of his brain.

486
00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:20.639
So King Shark was trying
to resist Grodd's iron will?

487
00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.995
Respect.

488
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.958
If Grodd's had his powers
for a year.

489
00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.599
why wait until now
to escape?

490
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.070
It's probably no coincidence
that the first thing he did

491
00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.958
was steal the telepathic crown.

492
00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.110
Tanya did say she's been

493
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.714
working on the crown
for a while.

494
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.996
Grodd probably knew this
was his perfect opportunity.

495
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.117
And it was thanks
to our tech.

496
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.237
All right. well.
now that Grodd has the crown.

497
00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.993
what's gonna happen
when he uses it?

498
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.471
It'll amplify his mental
abilities a thousandfold.

499
00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.950
Instead of just
being able to mind control

500
00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.793
a few people at a time...

501
00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.600
He'll be able to
control the whole city.

502
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.870
Forgive me.
I'm intruding.

503
00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.553
Or am I?

504
00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:10.270
I see him out there and I see
you in here in the shadows.

505
00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.760
Why is that. I wonder?

506
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.718
Can you blame me?

507
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.234
You saw his hand transform.

508
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.597
Yes. right.
"Shark Week!"

509
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.956
Not something you see
every day. but no.

510
00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.999
I thought your
hesitation occurred

511
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.311
before that moment.
not after.

512
00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.070
It was a slight hesitation.
but it was there nonetheless.

513
00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.834
Again.
why do you think that is?

514
00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.400
I don't know...

515
00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.791
No? Well. perhaps
I could be so bold as to offer

516
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.839
a suggestion that
it is not the hand

517
00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.037
of which you were frightened.
but rather.

518
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.840
it was seeing the face

519
00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.316
of the man that you love.

520
00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.393
I don't love Shay.
We're friends.

521
00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.154
All right. well. let's take
a look at that too. shall we?

522
00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.550
So this is a friend
from another Earth.

523
00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.797
for whom you left
a high-paying job

524
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.031
and for whom you have
dedicated every waking moment

525
00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.680
of your life trying to help.
It doesn't quite add up.

526
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.798
I can't love Shay.

527
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.430
He's my dead husband's
doppelganger from Earth-2.

528
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.592
How crazy would I have to be
to fall in love with him?

529
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.399
No crazier than
marrying the same woman

530
00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.039
from five different Earths...

531
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.992
I know.

532
00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.600
I'm very good
at marrying people.

533
00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.115
but not so great
at staying married.

534
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.714
Along the way. though.

535
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.474
on these countless Earths
and countless doppelgangers.

536
00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.552
I learned there is one thing

537
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.678
that makes all of us unique.

538
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.316
And if that

539
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.950
is what you fell in love with.
well then.

540
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.714
perhaps a face
doesn't matter that much.

541
00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.273
You missed
a beautiful sunset earlier.

542
00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.840
Too bad.

543
00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.480
- It's my favorite time of day.
- Mine. too.

544
00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.712
I almost forgot
what one looked like.

545
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.237
Did you know sharks
are colorblind?

546
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.870
When I was King Shark.
my world was dull and gray.

547
00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.230
And then I met you.
and everything changed.

548
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.875
I thought you were avoiding me.

549
00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.792
I was.

550
00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.918
but not anymore.

551
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.879
Tanya. are you disappointed
in me now that I'm...

552
00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.078
No. not at all.

553
00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.838
They say every sunset
is unique.

554
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.357
Do you think that's true?

555
00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.397
Yes. I do.

556
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.593
Dad. this is not
going to work.

557
00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.637
You haven't
even tried it yet.

558
00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.720
Look. I get it.

559
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.656
I'm supposed to take out
my frustrations on that bag

560
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.639
and somehow get over it.
but it's not that easy.

561
00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.074
To confront what ails you?

562
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.157
No. it's not.
It's hard.

563
00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.056
I had to go all the way
across the world to do it.

564
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.276
Are you talking about Tibet?

565
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.874
I thought you went there
to see Wally.

566
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.736
I did. but that's not
the only reason I went.

567
00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.592
I went there to heal.

568
00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.558
Is that why you were gone
for so long?

569
00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.553
Wally convinced me
to come east with the baby.

570
00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.280
He said that it would help me
repair my mind.

571
00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.670
my body.
restore this old soul of mine.

572
00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.831
So with Cecile's blessing.

573
00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.480
that's what I did.

574
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.920
And did it work?

575
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.118
I bent. baby girl.

576
00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.510
But Cicada
ain't going to break me.

577
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.080
Ain't going
to break you either.

578
00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.514
Come on.

579
00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.073
Come on. Iris.
Show Cicada what you got.

580
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.631
Break him. Iris.

581
00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.155
Break him!

582
00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.392
Yeah.

583
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.193
What's happening?

584
00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.590
Our fuzzy friend is
climbing up the Broome Belfry.

585
00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.194
What is it with him
and that tower?

586
00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.237
'Cause it's at the exact
epicenter of the city...

587
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.120
Making it the perfect place
to broadcast from.

588
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.759
He's going to use the crown.

589
00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.196
And get inside everyone's
head in the city.

590
00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.633
<i>Hear your master. Humans.</i>

591
00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:56.237
<i>Soon.
you will only know my will...</i>

592
00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:01.270
<i>the will of Grodd!</i>

593
00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.394
How long before everyone's
under Grodd's mind control?

594
00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.994
A few minutes. maybe less.

595
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.176
We need to dismantle that crown
and get it away from him.

596
00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.350
I can try talking to him.

597
00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:13.616
He's always had
a sweet spot for me.

598
00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.736
- Good.
<i>- The hell you will.</i>

599
00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.195
Nope. Killer Frost is gonna
be a hard sell on that one.

600
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.033
We're immune
to his mind control. right.

601
00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.554
because we're speedsters?

602
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.120
No.

603
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.953
Okay. The Flash Museum
just straight up

604
00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.394
got a lot of stuff wrong.

605
00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.800
Wait.
but do you have any extra

606
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.440
anti-mind control
headsets lying around?

607
00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.576
There's a few
in the workshop.

608
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.114
but it didn't work
so well last time.

609
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.873
Yeah.
but now there's two of us.

610
00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.616
I need you to run at him
as fast as you can

611
00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.233
- without reversing time.
- Okay.

612
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.516
That'll get his attention.
What are you gonna do?

613
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.353
An old trick.

614
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.354
Get the crown!

615
00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.474
Dad?

616
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.275
<i>We can't move.</i>

617
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.714
The mental dampeners
are working.

618
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.314
<i>but Grodd's too strong.</i>

619
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.256
I'm trying to hack into the crown.
but Grodd won't let me.

620
00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.760
He's gonna kill them.

621
00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.594
Not if you turn me back.

622
00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.194
I can stop Grodd.

623
00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:48.950
He can't read my mind...
at least. not when I'm a shark.

624
00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.679
Can you do that?

625
00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.752
I mean. if we accelerate
the cell cycle.

626
00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.256
use something that
will prompt a return

627
00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.158
to the dark matter
cellular form.

628
00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.596
Right. right. perhaps
a vibration or a jolt. right?

629
00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.592
Yes. if it was strong enough.

630
00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.478
but there would be
permanent consequences.

631
00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.517
If we re-saturate
your meta-genic cells.

632
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.776
that will eliminate
the possibility

633
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.269
for you to transform them
back into human cells.

634
00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.114
He won't be able
to use the cure.

635
00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.830
Shay. if you agree to this.

636
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.673
you'll never be human again.

637
00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.037
Tanya. I can save Flash.
the people of this city. you.

638
00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.976
and make up for some of the
horrible things I've done.

639
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.639
I have to do this.

640
00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.676
I'm afraid of losing you.

641
00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.911
You won't.

642
00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.630
Well. is there
anyone in this room

643
00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.632
that can provide
a vibrational jolt?

644
00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.870
I'm doing it.

645
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:15.076
<i>My mind grows.</i>

646
00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.350
<i>Soon.</i>

647
00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:19.512
<i>Grodd will rule this city.</i>

648
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.193
<i>this world.</i>

649
00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.033
<i>And you...</i>

650
00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.796
<i>gone forever.</i>

651
00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.071
- King Shark?
- Huh?

652
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.075
King Shark wants you gone!

653
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.078
Oh. no.

654
00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.238
Guys. King Shark's not moving.

655
00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.879
When a shark
is turned upside down.

656
00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.394
it enters tonic immobility.

657
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.073
<i>He's in a state of paralysis.</i>

658
00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.355
How do we wake him up?

659
00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.159
Don't sharks have
electroreceptor organs

660
00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.913
called ampullae of Lorenzini?

661
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.356
It's how they detect
electromagnetic fields. right?

662
00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.999
Yes. it's how they navigate.

663
00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.276
And it will also
attract electricity. right?

664
00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:43.115
So if we can get enough
electricity to him. we can...

665
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.096
- Electrify his ass back up.
- Electrify his ass right up.

666
00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.032
<i>- Barry!</i>
- Yeah. we heard.

667
00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.713
Time for another old trick.

668
00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.594
You okay?

669
00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.671
- Yes!
- Yes!

670
00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.072
Nothing to it.

671
00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.712
Long live the king.

672
00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.034
I know Grodd almost
turned all of our brains

673
00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.635
into scrambled egg.
but that Kaiju battle

674
00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.632
was the stuff of dreams.

675
00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.234
Seriously.
way better than anything

676
00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.754
I read in The Flash Museum.

677
00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.672
Now that
Grodd is safely locked up.

678
00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.400
what's stopping him
from getting out again?

679
00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.437
A medically-induced coma.

680
00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.113
one safely administered
by Caitlin

681
00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.520
and the A.R.G.U.S.
medical staff.

682
00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.751
Exposure to the crown
kickstarted Grodd's

683
00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.473
mental abilities
into high gear.

684
00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:41.074
They're growing even now.

685
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.756
Fortunately. I realized that if
Grodd's brain remains inactive.

686
00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.320
he can't access
his mental powers.

687
00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.631
Add in newly-enhanced
AI power dampeners

688
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.916
that upgrade to keep up
with Grodd's power.

689
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.151
You're welcome. by the way...

690
00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.959
anything it takes
to keep the city safe.

691
00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.599
Speaking of
keeping the city safe.

692
00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.797
we couldn't have
done this without Shay.

693
00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:02.351
How'd you guys convince him
to turn back into King Shark?

694
00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.193
We didn't.

695
00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.919
He volunteered.

696
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.117
And you can never turn him
back into a human?

697
00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:09.600
I don't think so.

698
00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.230
So he's gonna stay
King Shark forever?

699
00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.915
Well.

700
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.912
the good guys won once again.

701
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.152
and yet you do not seem like
you're really celebrating.

702
00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.799
Why that is?

703
00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.190
After all
that's happened today.

704
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.840
I just wonder
how it will affect...

705
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.912
Your relationship?

706
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.469
Well. that's a big question.
I must admit.

707
00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.233
But you know what?

708
00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:47.711
You will figure it out.
both of you. together.

709
00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.871
If so.
we'll have you to thank.

710
00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.997
- Oh. no. no. no. no.
- Me especially.

711
00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.554
No. no. no.
I did nothing.

712
00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.176
No. you're right.
I did help quite a bit.

713
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.839
The point here is simply this.

714
00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:01.000
and that is that whether
it's man or shark or...

715
00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:03.800
man-shark.

716
00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:08.716
the heart wants
what the heart wants.

717
00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.872
And so.
you must be open to that.

718
00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.873
Sounds like you've solved
life's greatest mystery.

719
00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.714
Well. that's what I do.

720
00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.111
If so.

721
00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:25.911
I hope one day. you find
what you're looking for too...

722
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.276
maybe in another doppelganger.

723
00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.160
Of course.

724
00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.277
I'll leave you to it.

725
00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:45.313
<i>Tanya. you look sad.</i>

726
00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.471
<i>Why?</i>

727
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.352
We found each other today.

728
00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.671
and now that connection is...

729
00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.992
<i>Still here.</i>

730
00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:59.039
Shay. what you did...

731
00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:03.831
<i>I would do it again
for you. my love.</i>

732
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.959
Time to bend.

733
00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.799
King Shark
versus Gorilla Grodd?

734
00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:53.759
Are you kidding me?
I missed that?

735
00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:06.839
Are you sure you don't want
something a bit more grown up?

736
00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:08.912
Um. you take that back.

737
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.959
This snack is a delicacy
no matter how old you are.

738
00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.599
Guys. hey.

739
00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.712
I just... Swedish Fish?

740
00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.712
I love those.

741
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:22.636
Um. look.
I know today has been crazy.

742
00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.677
and I just wanted to
make sure that we're good.

743
00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:27.229
I know Grodd made you
blast me in the face

744
00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.159
but I also know
I kinda deserved it...

745
00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.475
same with being ice blasted.

746
00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:34.314
I shouldn't have used
the cure as a weapon

747
00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.198
and forced it on King Shark.

748
00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.351
I promise
it won't happen again.

749
00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.314
Apology accepted.

750
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:47.392
Goober.

751
00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.837
And we know something good
did come out of today.

752
00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.559
We know the
meta-human cure works.

753
00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.200
And now we can use it
to help all of the metas

754
00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.193
in Central City and beyond.

755
00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.273
Maybe we start with Cicada.

756
00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.833
I'm sorry. what?

757
00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:07.276
I know. I just...

758
00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.754
people can surprise you.

759
00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.593
Today definitely
reminded me that.

760
00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.514
And like you've been saying.
everybody deserves a choice

761
00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.354
to be whoever they want to be...

762
00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.750
that includes our enemies.

763
00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.512
I think we should offer
the cure to Cicada.

764
00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.920
<i>Greg. move your head.</i>
