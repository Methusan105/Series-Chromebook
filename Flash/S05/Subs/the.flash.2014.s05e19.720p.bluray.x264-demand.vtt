<i>My name is Barry Allen.</i>

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.111
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.200
<i>To the outside world.</i>

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.192
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist.</i>

5
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.595
<i>But secretly. with the help</i>

6
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.319
<i>of my friends
at S.T.A.R. Labs.</i>

7
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.960
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans</i>

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.275
<i>like me.</i>

9
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.556
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help.</i>

10
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.871
<i>she changed the present</i>

11
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.475
<i>and now our world is
more dangerous than ever.</i>

12
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.870
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

13
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.435
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

14
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.391
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

15
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.870
- Is my dad even really...
- Caitlin. your father is dead.

16
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.394
- Dad?
- You found me.

17
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.914
I want to make it up
to you. Caity.

18
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.674
I really should've
been there for you.

19
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.536
<i>Icicle wouldn't have gone
to all this trouble</i>

20
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.519
to kill my dad if there wasn't
a piece of him still left.

21
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.512
We got Dwyer.
we gave him the cure.

22
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.954
<i>but another Cicada showed up.</i>

23
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.440
She wants to tell you
her secret.

24
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.874
Someone instructed you
to do it.

25
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.758
Eobard Thawne.

26
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.719
Dad. please don't do this!

27
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.076
Nora. if you try to run back
in time again.

28
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.759
I will feel it in
the Speed Force.

29
00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.910
Good-bye. Nora.

30
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.394
You took our daughter
back to the future?

31
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.278
I didn't have
any other choice.

32
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.034
I? It's we. Barry.

33
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.349
We. She's <i>our</i> daughter.

34
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.760
- not just yours.
- I know that.

35
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.069
But you left her there
anyway?

36
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.675
I can't trust her. Iris!

37
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.513
That puts all of us in danger!

38
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.632
That's how you feel. Barry.

39
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.313
What about asking how I feel?

40
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.471
I didn't think I had to!

41
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.120
Of course you didn't.

42
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.395
Of course you didn't. Barry!

43
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.936
You always see one way
through a problem

44
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.155
and damn what I think.

45
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.919
Wait. wait. what the hell
does that mean?

46
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.037
You know. we have been
through so much crap.

47
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.554
we have been through
so much therapy

48
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.790
and you are still...

49
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.156
still making decisions
based on your emotions!

50
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.072
'Cause I'm right this time!

51
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.389
Flashpoint?

52
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.233
Going to the Speed Force
and leaving me?

53
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.754
Were you right those times too?

54
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.400
You think I wanted
to do this?

55
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.278
That this was easy?

56
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.274
Seeing Nora looking at me.
asking for forgiveness.

57
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.353
knowing it might be
the last time I ever see her?

58
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.235
What about the last time
that I get to see her. Barry?

59
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.471
I didn't even get a chance
to say good-bye!

60
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.314
Damn it. Iris.
she lied to us for months!

61
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.278
And she explained why!

62
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.352
That she was working
with Thawne?

63
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.952
That doesn't bother you.

64
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.318
No. it doesn't.

65
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.194
Maybe if he killed
your mother in front of you.

66
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.953
you'd feel differently.

67
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.878
Maybe you feeling
differently. Barry.

68
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.816
is why we should have made
this decision together.

69
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.672
She just wanted to meet you.
Barry.

70
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.240
The father that she never knew.

71
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.558
and there was one person
who could teach her how to do that.

72
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.155
Is it really so hard
to understand

73
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.799
why she would go to him?

74
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.439
It doesn't matter
if I understand it.

75
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.915
Thawne is manipulating her.

76
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.999
He's on death row. Barry.
How is he manipulating her?

77
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.795
You know. if this were
anybody else. you'd back me.

78
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.030
But because it's Nora.
because it's our daughter.

79
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.034
the person who finally
stopped hating you.

80
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.599
you refuse to see
how dangerous this is.

81
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.440
I mean. you talk about making
decisions based on emotion.

82
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.193
Look in the mirror.

83
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.472
All those years without
my father

84
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.075
and you gave me
a second chance.

85
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.994
And now I've lost him
all over again.

86
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.152
I failed you.
Little Runner.

87
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.393
No. this is my fault.

88
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.279
I should've never lied to them
about working with you.

89
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.279
Well. perhaps not.

90
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.115
I screwed everything up.

91
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.232
And now I can't even help them
catch Cicada

92
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.789
because my dad will know
if I run into the Speed Force.

93
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.236
Mm-hmm.

94
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.437
He most certainly will.

95
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.314
Wait.

96
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.234
Wait.

97
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.233
You've run into the Speed Force
hundreds of times.

98
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.960
And my father.
other speedsters.

99
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.760
they never felt you coming.

100
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.274
How did you do that?

101
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.600
Thawne.
tell me how you did it.

102
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.239
- Nora.
- Tell me. Thawne!

103
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.710
It's not for you.

104
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.157
I need to see my father.

105
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.272
Please. if there is a way

106
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.670
I can go back in time
to see him undetected.

107
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.433
you have to tell me how.

108
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.677
I used to idolize
your father.

109
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.714
I wanted to be just like him.

110
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.193
But that was not my fate.
I was to be the reverse.

111
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.351
Opposite of him...

112
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.830
in every way.

113
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.560
And so instead of tapping
into the Speed Force

114
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.270
to access my powers...

115
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.957
I created my own.

116
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.794
You created
your own Speed Force?

117
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.280
Yes. I did.

118
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.272
And I can access it
to go back in time?

119
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.717
That and more.

120
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.837
Can you teach me
how to use it?

121
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.396
Well. I... I have to warn you.
Nora.

122
00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.235
It's a little bit negative.

123
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.480
Hey. where is Cecile
and Cisco?

124
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.153
Cecile's relieving
the nanny.

125
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.674
And Cisco went
to talk to Breacher

126
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.080
about how to track Cicada Il.

127
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.560
Okay.

128
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.552
Where's Iris?

129
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.791
Uh. I honestly don't know.

130
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.917
We're not really seeing
eye to eye right now.

131
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.196
Because?

132
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.478
Because I took Nora home
for good.

133
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.433
Nora's gone?

134
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.000
Just like that?

135
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.677
Well. only thing to do.
really.

136
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.355
because Nora can't be trusted.

137
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.837
I can deduce from your faces
that you're upset.

138
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.355
but you understand the truth
need to be exposed.

139
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.080
Yes. we understand that.

140
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.312
What you don't understand
is that this is a family.

141
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.790
You didn't include anyone
in this.

142
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.473
Oh. look. Baby Giraffe...

143
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.472
Sherloque.
you've done enough.

144
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.976
- All right?
- Oh. I have not done enough.

145
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.136
We still have another Cicada
to catch.

146
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.072
Man. he says
you've done enough.

147
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.238
Well. perhaps I have.

148
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.431
I got to take this. Yeah?

149
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.637
Look. since Cisco
didn't take me with him.

150
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.598
I'm gonna round up
the Cicada Il files.

151
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.536
Cecile and I are going
to go over them tomorrow.

152
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.473
see if anything makes
my nose wiggle.

153
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.635
Are you gonna be okay?

154
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.712
I honestly don't know.

155
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.598
Guys. it's CCPD.

156
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.319
We've got a big problem.

157
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.160
The nurses heard a crash
in the middle of the night

158
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.316
but nobody saw anything.

159
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.198
By the time they got here.

160
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.879
Grace was gone.

161
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.555
Judging by the thermal
warping in this glass.

162
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.714
an energy blast with a lot
of heat took out the window.

163
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.678
But I don't really think
we need any clues

164
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.036
to know who took her.

165
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.555
Future Grace steals
past Grace.

166
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.632
I don't even know if there's
a police code

167
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.154
for kidnapping yourself.

168
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.515
Hey. what's it say?

169
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.875
Grace's coma is stable.

170
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.896
As long as future Grace is
looking after younger Grace.

171
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.434
her life's not in any danger.

172
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.752
We still have no way
to find either of them.

173
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.071
Could things get any worse?

174
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.357
Working late.
Dr. Tannhauser?

175
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.955
Or working early.
depending how you see it.

176
00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.759
Well. I stopped by
to say good night.

177
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.911
So I guess I'll say
good morning.

178
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.798
Good morning. J.P.

179
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.896
<i>Get back!
Hold it right there!</i>

180
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.599
Thomas?

181
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.395
I don't suppose Icicle

182
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.312
left any frozen fingerprints
behind?

183
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.756
No. but this docking station

184
00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.275
is lined with a carbon-filled
Kapton polyimide.

185
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.192
NASA uses it to build probes

186
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.795
meant for the coldest reaches
of space.

187
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.553
There's a lot
of fresh puddles in here.

188
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.871
You think he stole whatever
kept this place cold?

189
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.356
- Try way beyond cold.
- Why would he want it?

190
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.496
You're going to have
to ask Carla

191
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.113
when she's done filing
the theft report.

192
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.839
or Caitlyn when she gets here.

193
00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.197
I'm not sure about much lately.

194
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.396
Hey. Barr.

195
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.632
Have you talked to Iris
since she left?

196
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.110
I'm just giving her
some space.

197
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.715
Well. all right. Just make sure
you don't give her too much.

198
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.075
<i>The right choice?</i>

199
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.753
What the
hell are you talking about?

200
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.912
You lied to me for 20 years
and told me my father was dead.

201
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.514
How the hell is that
the right choice?

202
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.195
Your father is trapped
inside an ice monster. Caitlyn.

203
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.320
What was I supposed to do?

204
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.153
Split custody with him
on the weekends?

205
00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.357
I don't know. You could try
telling me the truth.

206
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.318
But why tell your daughter
anything?

207
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.153
Funny. I don't recall you
telling me

208
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.993
that you let the monster
out of the prison.

209
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.198
Because you never told me
he was in a prison!

210
00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.336
And now all these years
that I could've been working on

211
00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.591
a cure for dad are gone!

212
00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.672
We may never get him back.

213
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.956
Well. at least you have
someone to blame.

214
00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.872
Mom's always here for that.

215
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.196
Are you okay?

216
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.636
I will be as soon as
we find Icicle.

217
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.359
My mom told me what he stole.

218
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.557
It's a prototype Cryo-Atomizer.

219
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.270
- And what can he do with that?
- Nothing good.

220
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.317
My contacts upstate
got nothing.

221
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.437
I even tried Kritschgau
at the DOD. Nada.

222
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.240
Nobody can spare the manpower
to help find Cicada 2.0.

223
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.993
Hey. what about the <i>Citizen?</i>

224
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.790
Any fresh leads on Cicada?
Iris?

225
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.191
Hello? Um. Earth to Iris?

226
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.192
Ralph. wait!

227
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.354
"Barry. I don't know if I can
ever forgive you for this."

228
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.176
I think you missed
a comma there.

229
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.839
Can you stay out of it
for once?

230
00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.195
She's not kidding.
Super mad.

231
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.117
No. Look. um. Iris.

232
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.157
I know how Barry can be.

233
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.038
But you guys are like

234
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.715
the Meghan and Harry
of superhero royalty.

235
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.951
Your love is eternal.

236
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.952
- You two will talk and... and...
- We did talk.

237
00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.112
I want Nora to stay here.
he doesn't.

238
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.034
How do we solve that?

239
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.589
Okay. Iris. honey.

240
00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.117
I haven't always been in the
near-perfect relationship

241
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.600
that I'm in now.

242
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.076
So take it from someone
with experience.

243
00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.120
the only way you two solve
this problem is together.

244
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.880
And you're not going
to find your answers here.

245
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.714
Yeah. you're right.

246
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.557
- You need to go after her.
- Oh. come on.

247
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.632
Give me a break.
Have you seen her right hook?

248
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.394
Ralph. she's hurt.
I know.

249
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.234
But there's something more.
I feel it.

250
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.631
She's determined.

251
00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.951
<i>Reprogramming complete.</i>

252
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.032
The Time Sphere's
navigation core is now locked

253
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.032
onto Nora West-Allen's
temporal signature.

254
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.040
And you disabled the
tracker that Cisco installed

255
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.679
- into the Sphere?
- Yes.

256
00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.752
However. there are still
alarms in S.T.A.R. Labs.

257
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.877
If you wish to use
the Sphere undetected.

258
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.475
you must activate it off-site.

259
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.509
Planning a trip?

260
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.159
How did you get in here?

261
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.896
Followed you then stretched
under the door.

262
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.016
By the way.
was anybody ever gonna

263
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.599
tell me about this secret room?

264
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.416
What else do we got in here?
A bowling alley or something?

265
00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.352
Ralph. I don't have time
for this.

266
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.760
Actually. it looks like you
have all the time in the world.

267
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.240
You're not gonna stop me.

268
00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.312
Who said anything
about stopping you?

269
00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.320
<i>I'm in position.</i>

270
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.198
<i>Thawne. I said I'm ready.</i>

271
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.953
We shall see if you're ready.

272
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.111
<i>Now run.</i>

273
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.036
Now listen to me. Nora.

274
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.589
Breathe. Breathe.

275
00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.911
You're reaching out
and nobody's there.

276
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.593
<i>The loneliness is pain.</i>

277
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.149
Pain racing through your mind.

278
00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.714
Crushing you. wrecking you.

279
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.874
<i>shattering your soul into
a million little pieces.</i>

280
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.237
And suddenly.
you are no longer you.

281
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.359
<i>You're part of something
different now.</i>

282
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.671
Part of a negative force.

283
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.591
It didn't work.

284
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.115
<i>Thawne. why didn't it work?</i>

285
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.153
- Are you ready?
- All set to hit

286
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.720
88 miles an hour!

287
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.312
Here we go.

288
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.960
Open the time breach!

289
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.636
Ralph. hurry up!

290
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.560
So the Cryo-Atomizer
has the ability

291
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.155
to disperse particles
into the atmosphere.

292
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.153
Particles that slow down atoms
to a grinding halt.

293
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.516
And the slower they get...
The colder they get.

294
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.592
- How cold are we talking?
- Absolute zero.

295
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.400
And if we combine them
with Icicle's meta-powers...

296
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.597
He could plunge Central City
into a new Ice Age.

297
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.273
There is some good news.

298
00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.238
I think we can track
the nano-cryoparticles

299
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.913
inside the atomizer.

300
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.754
We just have to reprogram an
oscillating inversion scanner.

301
00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.656
Do you mind running to the
downstairs storage area

302
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.717
- and grabbing it?
- Mm-hmm.

303
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.634
Wait. You should use
a modified field array.

304
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.160
There's one in
the upstairs archives.

305
00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.720
No. no. actually
the inversion scanner

306
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.200
would work best.
Thank you.

307
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.239
No. no. Not since we upgraded
our field arrays last year.

308
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.280
You know. you would know that
if you visited more.

309
00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.033
not just when
you needed something.

310
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.476
Apparently. only when
I need the wrong thing.

311
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.559
- The inversion scanner.
- The field array.

312
00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.679
I'll get both.

313
00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.353
Might take my time.

314
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.840
You need help?

315
00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.070
No.

316
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.679
Is it me or is it getting
really cold in here?

317
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.240
Run!

318
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.677
Two for one.

319
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.914
So who wants
a family reunion?

320
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.071
Hm?

321
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.879
<i>Adieu.</i> Team Flash.

322
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.435
Barry. Barry. come on!

323
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.752
Come on. Barr!

324
00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.399
I can barely feel his pulse.

325
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.836
He has hypothermia.
His heart rate's dropping.

326
00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.071
We only have seconds
to save him.

327
00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.436
What are you doing?
Well. this...

328
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.159
this machine has
a large power source

329
00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.959
I need to access
to save Monsieur Allen.

330
00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.680
Watch out.

331
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.594
That'll work.
Stand back.

332
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.353
All right.

333
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.000
This current should heat up
the copper wiring

334
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.016
of his suit's circuitry and
we just need to heat it up enough

335
00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.599
so that his speed healing
kicks in.

336
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.558
- Is this safe?
- Safer than dying.

337
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.360
- Come on. Monsieur Allen.
- Barry?

338
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.079
- Come on!
- Barr!

339
00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.799
Icicle. He has them.

340
00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.872
No. no. no. no. Monsieur.
No. no. wait. No. wait.

341
00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.316
In time. In time.
First. you rest.

342
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.359
Then we bring them home
together.

343
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.000
Where are we?

344
00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.118
In another decommissioned
Tannhauser site.

345
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.199
This site is a little more
off-the-grid than usual.

346
00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.715
It's where we kept our
most classified projects.

347
00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.396
Great. I guess we are
Icicle's next project.

348
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.437
We need to get out of here.

349
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.318
Well. there's a circuit panel
over here.

350
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.000
I think we can hack it
and open the door.

351
00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.311
Neither one of us knows
about electrical engineering.

352
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.437
Our best bet is to break me out
of these meta-cuffs

353
00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.000
and let Killer Frost
do the rest.

354
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.760
Don't be foolish.
You'll never break those.

355
00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.416
Well. it's no more foolish
than you electrocuting

356
00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.035
yourself. but if you want to.
knock yourself out.

357
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.713
You'd like that.
wouldn't you?

358
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.675
How did we get here?

359
00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.991
I mean. you're my mother
and I'm your daughter.

360
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.151
But it has never felt
like that.

361
00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.511
You've always
been cold. distant.

362
00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.592
You never wanted to be
a part of my life.

363
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.240
Not then and certainly not now.

364
00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.720
Why?

365
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.076
I mean. what did I ever do
to get treated like this?

366
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.880
- What?
- Why did you leave me?

367
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.639
You left me first.

368
00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.396
You went to school across the
country to get away from me.

369
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.153
You took a job in Central City

370
00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.436
instead of working in
the same zip code as my lab.

371
00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.957
Caitlin. you were married
to a man I never even met.

372
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.594
I got the hint.

373
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.400
but don't you dare
mistake things.

374
00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.352
I didn't leave first.

375
00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.376
What are we doing here?
What do you want with us?

376
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.472
I want what you could be.

377
00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.280
- Stop it!
- It's just a small blood sample.

378
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:52.076
See you soon. Snow Pack.

379
00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.114
- What?
- Snow Pack.

380
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.078
That was your father's nickname
for our family.

381
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.232
I remember.
and why is that scaring you?

382
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.477
He said he wanted
what we could be

383
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.239
and then he took a sample
of your blood.

384
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.471
Theoretically. he could use
the Cryo-Atomizer

385
00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.598
to recreate the process
that created Killer Frost.

386
00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.673
So if he did that to you...
I would gain an ice persona.

387
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.096
And now with
a sample of my blood...

388
00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.349
He can create a serum

389
00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.216
that will permanently suppress
our human sides.

390
00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.072
He wants an ice family

391
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.953
and he's willing
to erase us to get it.

392
00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.718
- Hold my suit.
- Oh. my God. Ralph.

393
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.792
- Do you ever wash this thing?
- Focus. okay?

394
00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.136
You sure you're ready to talk
to "he who shall not be named"?

395
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.674
Well. whether I am or not.
Gideon said

396
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.360
that these were
Nora's last known coordinates.

397
00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.912
You're up.

398
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.429
Hey. bro.

399
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.233
Uh. what a day.
Am I right?

400
00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.960
You mind if I get a quick word
there with Hannibal Speedster?

401
00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.839
It's just going to take.
like. a second.

402
00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.115
Is that right?

403
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.352
Well. unless you got a signed
Shift Change Order.

404
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.797
nobody goes in there
but me. bro.

405
00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.633
Only you. huh?

406
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.519
Okay. if you insist.

407
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.314
- Hm.
- Oh. shrap.

408
00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.714
Oh. Ooh.

409
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.154
<i>You need to hurry.</i>

410
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.833
This guy's such a dick.
I got to think

411
00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.594
super douchey thoughts
just to keep this face on.

412
00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.634
Douchey. douchey. douchey.

413
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.872
I did everything exactly
like you told me.

414
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.599
How come I can't do this?

415
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.639
Listen. not harboring
enough rage to fuel your trip

416
00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.936
is not something
to be ashamed of.

417
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.120
You're just like your father.

418
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.159
Your light.
it's your greatest strength.

419
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.391
- Nora.
- Mom?

420
00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.240
Step away from him. please.

421
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.357
Mom. it's okay.

422
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.318
Eobard is helping me.

423
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.232
He has a way for me
to get back home.

424
00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.279
Nora. step away from him now.

425
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:12.149
Nora. listen to your mother.

426
00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.240
Where's Dad?

427
00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.391
It's just me.

428
00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.995
It's probably for the best.
Come on. we have to hurry.

429
00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.276
What do you mean.
it's probably for the best?

430
00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.840
Nora. the last thing
your father needs

431
00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.752
is to see you
here with him.

432
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.877
She's right about that.

433
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.030
No.

434
00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.470
No. she's not.
and neither is my dad.

435
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.313
Nora. your dad was wrong.

436
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.800
but he still cares about you.

437
00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.633
Why are you here
and he isn't?

438
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.313
Look. I understand
how you feel...

439
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.800
Do you?

440
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.151
Do you know what it's like
to want something more

441
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.391
than anything else
in your whole life?

442
00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.119
To know your father?

443
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.432
To do your best to follow
in his footsteps?

444
00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.920
To make him proud?

445
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.794
How could he leave me?

446
00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.712
- Wait. wait! That's enough!
- Nora.

447
00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.678
How could he stop loving me?

448
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.000
Lia! No!

449
00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.960
<i>It's always
the same condescending</i>

450
00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.396
<i>"I know better than you"
crap.</i>

451
00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.800
and you never change!

452
00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.056
<i>She's trying to kill me.</i>

453
00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.240
<i>- Who else knows?</i>
- Everyone.

454
00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.720
It's time for you to go home.

455
00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.194
Good-bye. Nora.

456
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.112
<i>Goodbye. Nora.
Goodbye. Nora.</i>

457
00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.995
She's gone.

458
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.594
What the hell do you mean.
she's gone?

459
00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.114
- Gone where?
- I don't know where.

460
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.839
I only know when. 2019.

461
00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:04.071
When Nora said you
showed her a way back...

462
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.674
she meant your way.

463
00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.355
Yes.
And I made a mistake.

464
00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.397
She wanted to go home.
I tried to help her.

465
00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.119
But listen. Iris.
you have to find her.

466
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.839
She needs her family.

467
00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.879
And that family
does not include you.

468
00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.316
But it does include Barry.

469
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.756
She needs you both. united.

470
00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.593
I'm only going
to say this once.

471
00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.717
You don't get
to comment on us.

472
00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.473
You stay the hell out
of our business

473
00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.296
or you won't even make it
to the end of that timer.

474
00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.880
I like your anger.

475
00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.475
but don't let it drive
Barry away.

476
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.597
The only way for you
to help Nora

477
00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.273
is by doing it as a family.

478
00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:43.310
Otherwise. you're simply
leaving Barry

479
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.835
the exact same way
he left Nora.

480
00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:52.197
Iris. we got to bail.
They found Officer Jackass.

481
00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.079
Think about it.

482
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.674
Iris. please.

483
00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.040
What's it like having
another person in your head?

484
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.674
Pretty crazy.

485
00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.877
I mean. when she first
showed up.

486
00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.360
I couldn't wait
to get rid of her.

487
00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.319
but when she disappeared.

488
00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.197
I tried even harder
to get her back.

489
00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.239
What finally brought
her back?

490
00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.516
Family.

491
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.796
She protected us.

492
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.911
Well. I'm glad you had
someone there for you.

493
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:46.000
Hey. Mom. that was pretty
clever what you did.

494
00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.231
Figuring out Icicle's plan.

495
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.119
Well. I recall you
helped with that too.

496
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.476
It's amazing what we can do

497
00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.473
when we're not trying
to rip each other's heads off.

498
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.640
Stay away from her.

499
00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.279
I'll come back
for her later.

500
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.273
First. we have
some catching up to do.

501
00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.760
What?

502
00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.479
No!

503
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.160
Caitlyn!

504
00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.396
There's no leads.

505
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.393
There's no hits
on Icicle's cryosignature.

506
00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.352
no reads on facial recognition.
nothing.

507
00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.119
Barr. we'll find him.
We always do.

508
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.032
How. Joe?
How are we gonna find them?

509
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.395
Caitlyn's kidnapped.

510
00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.536
We need Caitlyn
to find Caitlyn.

511
00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.119
Cisco's on another Earth

512
00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.993
and Iris won't even answer
my calls!

513
00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.311
I...

514
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.119
I don't know how to fix
any of this.

515
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.759
If I might?

516
00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.797
It occurs to me that hiding

517
00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.679
a needle
in a haystack is good.

518
00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.717
Hiding a needle in
a stack of needles?

519
00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.235
That's better.

520
00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.431
These are all the cold spots
in the area.

521
00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.830
You think Icicle is masking
his cryo-signature

522
00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.320
with someplace
that's already cold?

523
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.993
Giving him the perfect cover.

524
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.240
So we just refocus
our search.

525
00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.551
look for temperature anomalies

526
00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.359
in already existing cold spots.
<i>et voila.</i>

527
00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.791
This is great. I'll start
retasking the satellites.

528
00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.080
- Hey. thanks for your help.
- The least I could do.

529
00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.958
I've got a cold spike.

530
00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.716
That's quite a stack
of needles.

531
00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:35.032
Thomas. are you in there?

532
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.396
Thomas. please.

533
00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:43.480
Now it's time to meet
your better half.

534
00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.597
Perfection.

535
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.558
Boo.

536
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.150
How did you get out?

537
00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.630
Me? I just raised my hands.

538
00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.393
You're the one
who froze my cuffs

539
00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.870
so they shattered like glass.

540
00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.280
Clever Caitlyn.

541
00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.636
I'm almost gonna miss her
when she's dead.

542
00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.394
No turning back now.
Time to make a choice.

543
00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.756
You either save her...

544
00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.112
Or fight me.

545
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.429
Save her.

546
00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.838
I'm gonna go get him.

547
00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.078
Okay. explain again
why I'm here doing this

548
00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.674
and not anybody else?

549
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.877
It appears we're a bit
short staffed at the moment.

550
00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.376
All right. if it's just us.
it's just us.

551
00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.776
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this thing.

552
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.216
- What's happening?
- Oh. great timing.

553
00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.856
Oh. yeah. good timing.
Oh. you do this.

554
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.314
Okay. Icicle has Caitlyn

555
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.710
and her mom in some caves
north of the Badlands.

556
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.296
Yes. but the Flash
is already on the scene.

557
00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.391
So for all we know.
the problem is already solved.

558
00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.631
<i>- Guys. I have a problem.</i>
- Or not.

559
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.598
I need to phase Carla
out of a cryo-chamber

560
00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.399
but it's too cold.
I can't even touch it.

561
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.073
All right.
we need heat fast.

562
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.958
What if he generates
a lightning bolt?

563
00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.576
He can't throw a bolt.
That would kill her.

564
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.831
Then why doesn't
he just. uh. hold onto it?

565
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.856
- That could kill him!
- No. no. He's right.

566
00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.440
The lightning cannot hurt you
if you are in phase.

567
00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.392
If half my molecules
are in phase.

568
00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.256
the electricity would hop
from stable molecule

569
00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.280
to stable molecule.

570
00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.456
<i>Creating an electron bridge</i>

571
00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.456
that will generate the heat
that you need. <i>et voila.</i>

572
00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.016
Without electrocuting him.
he can phase in.

573
00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.235
grab her.
and then phase out.

574
00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.352
All in three tenths of a second.

575
00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.920
Uh-huh.

576
00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.576
- I got you.
- I got you.

577
00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.160
<i>I'm going to warm her up.
all right?</i>

578
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.471
What a waste.

579
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.112
I wanted to make you perfect.

580
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.591
Now I must end you.

581
00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.119
Impossible.

582
00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.914
Caity?

583
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.320
Dad?

584
00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.357
Are you okay?

585
00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.319
Is it you?
Is it really you?

586
00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.756
It's me.

587
00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:03.560
- It's really me.
- Oh. Oh. my God.

588
00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.677
You're going to be okay.
You just need to take it slow.

589
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.519
Thomas?

590
00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.351
Oh. my God!

591
00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.840
- Are you...
- I'm okay.

592
00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:34.920
I took quite a beating

593
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.798
but Killer Frost's
ice healing kicked in.

594
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.600
I'm going to be fine
thanks to Dad.

595
00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.751
Well. how...
how is this possible?

596
00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.196
Well. I saw Icicle
about to kill Caitlyn.

597
00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.556
and I found the strength
to break through.

598
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.360
Just like Killer Frost.
Dad saved me.

599
00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.920
Well. you saved me too.
Caity.

600
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.480
I mean. thanks to you. I think

601
00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.358
I may have finally
banished this monster.

602
00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.877
That's good.

603
00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.351
That just leaves one more
monster for me to kill.

604
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.154
Run!

605
00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.112
Get out of here.
I'll take care of this.

606
00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.550
Cool knife. I've got two.

607
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.751
Caitlyn!

608
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.912
Dad? Dad. Please.

609
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.832
Caitlyn.

610
00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.434
Dad. I told you to go.

611
00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.398
I already left once before.

612
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.949
I left both of you.

613
00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.999
Worst mistake I've ever made
in my entire life.

614
00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.077
I wasn't going
to make that again.

615
00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.511
Family shouldn't leave family.

616
00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.879
I'll always love you.

617
00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.919
How's Caitlyn and her mom?

618
00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.554
Caitlin's still running
some tests.

619
00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.359
but she thinks Carla's
gonna be okay.

620
00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:15.912
I mean. as okay as she can be
given the circumstances.

621
00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.673
Why was Cicada Il even there
tonight?

622
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.190
I mean. why attack Icicle
and Caitlin?

623
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.840
Perhaps the ice meta were
not the primary target.

624
00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.833
What could Cicada Il want
with the Cryo-Atomizer?

625
00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:28.216
Well. we're not gonna figure
it out tonight.

626
00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.072
So let's rest tonight.

627
00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.719
Are you coming back
to the house?

628
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.951
Um...

629
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.631
No. I'm gonna stay
at the loft tonight.

630
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.077
You are?

631
00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.873
Yeah.

632
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.394
We should talk.

633
00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.840
Awkward a bit.

634
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.151
So you went to the future?

635
00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:55.153
Yeah. John Stamos.
still handsome.

636
00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.515
He'll never not age.

637
00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.991
No. never.
Man. he looks good.

638
00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.151
So this endothermic
litmus test

639
00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.277
would've created
a stoichiometric reaction.

640
00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.558
If there was any residual
meta DNA in your system. it...

641
00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.951
Would've turned white.
I know.

642
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.192
And it's still green.
so you're clean.

643
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.476
You're not a meta.

644
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.713
Those are all the clues
that I used to find Dad.

645
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.276
Including some files
that I may have stolen

646
00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.510
from your file room.

647
00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:34.679
Aww. Caitlin and Thomas'
infamous Periodic Table.

648
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.999
Nerdonium.

649
00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.719
You know.
he stole that one from me.

650
00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.593
Really? I thought
he came up with that

651
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.512
while he was fixing
the kitchen sink.

652
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.752
No. I thought of that.

653
00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.753
Come to think of it.
I also fixed the kitchen sink.

654
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.637
Well. I... I better be going.

655
00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.079
Good night. Caity.

656
00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.079
Mom?
Um...

657
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.118
Do you want to maybe
go get a drink?

658
00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:13.638
You can tell me more about
elements you invented.

659
00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.316
Now or whenever.

660
00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:21.519
No. actually.
now would be perfect.

661
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:30.110
I know a little wine bar
around the corner.

662
00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.357
Heading home?

663
00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:48.671
Well. it's like
Barry said... and Joe...

664
00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.991
- I've done enough.
- They did say that.

665
00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.396
But you hung around anyway.

666
00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.994
<i>Oui.</i> I did.

667
00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.278
You were there for Barry
when he needed you.

668
00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.636
<i>Oui.</i> I was.

669
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.359
And you helped saved
Caitlyn's mom.

670
00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.272
Yes. that's right.
I did all those things.

671
00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.272
I should not have done
those things?

672
00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.750
I'm just saying
maybe you have more to do...

673
00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.679
for your family.

674
00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:34.518
I just wanted
my family back together.

675
00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.637
Even if that meant doing
something drastic

676
00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.837
like time travel.

677
00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.600
Yeah. I get that.

678
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.153
More than anyone.

679
00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.118
You were right about Thawne.

680
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.310
I think he's manipulating
Nora.

681
00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.279
but I also believe him.

682
00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.560
Nora is back here in our time.

683
00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.873
I was...

684
00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.194
wrong.

685
00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.749
I shouldn't have left Nora

686
00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:16.915
or made that decision
without you.

687
00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:21.193
Whatever it is that
we have to figure out.

688
00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.954
we should've done it together.

689
00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.956
Family doesn't leave family.

690
00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.478
Well. I mean. you weren't the
only one to make that mistake.

691
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.919
I shouldn't have gone to
the future without you.

692
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.719
I shouldn't have left you
like that.

693
00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:44.237
I mean. that was the same thing
that I got so mad at you for.

694
00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.752
But I know now that we can't
solve this

695
00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.638
if we don't stick together.

696
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.038
I can barely
solve things with you.

697
00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.311
so without you...

698
00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:59.598
Are we making jokes already?
Really?

699
00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.711
Let's bring our kid home.

700
00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:11.273
There's something else
that I wanted to tell you.

701
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:17.077
Barry. the way that Thawne
looks when he talks about Nora.

702
00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.755
I've only ever seen that
in one other person.

703
00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.270
You.

704
00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.913
What are you saying?

705
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.277
I think Thawne
might actually care about Nora.

706
00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.880
Soon. Grace.

707
00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.713
Soon.

708
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.314
<i>Greg. move your head.</i>
