00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.150
<i>My name is Barry Allen.
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.199
<i>To the outside world. I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist.</i>

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.357
<i>But secretly. with the help
of my friends</i>

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.033
<i>at S.T.A.R. Labs.</i>

5
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.157
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.550
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help.</i>

7
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.871
<i>she changed the present.</i>

8
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.475
<i>And now our world is
more dangerous than ever.</i>

9
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.870
<i>and I'm the only one fast
enough to save it.</i>

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.277
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

11
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.919
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.753
- Who's Cicada?
<i>- You never catch him.</i>

13
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.069
<i>This is Sherloque.</i>

14
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.039
<i>He's the greatest
detective in all the multiverse.</i>

15
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.474
I'm a detective as well.

16
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.835
I'm here to catch
your killer.

17
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.116
So we're dealing with
a meta-human Jack the Ripper.

18
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.556
<i>In my history. he never
killed Gridlock or Block.</i>

19
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.233
<i>They're completely different
victims.</i>

20
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.676
- He's early.
- Because the timeline changed.

21
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.433
Because of me.

22
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.397
Guys. this is mad crazy!

23
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.996
There are. like.
fireballs in the sky!

24
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.720
Holy...

25
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.753
I'm gonna get a better look.

26
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.477
There he is!
This is gonna be lit.

27
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.073
Wait. there's two of them?

28
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.595
Oh. my God. guys.
What was that?

29
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.672
This is cray!
What is going on right now?

30
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.956
Is the world. like.
ending right now?

31
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.754
Oh. my phone.

32
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.958
You just saved my life.

33
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.554
You are the second speedster

34
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.359
who just. like.
saved the world.

35
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.593
Can I just get a...
can I just get a...

36
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.353
selfie.

37
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.832

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.110
Uh...

48
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.999
Sorry.

49
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.754
- What are you doing?
- Uh. nothing. Go back to bed.

50
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.336
I'm just making some breakfast.

51
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.476
Like I could go to sleep

52
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.597
after the smell
of Jitters coffee.

53
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.400
So. uh. I see you still know
your way around the kitchen.

54
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.834
What's happening?

55
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.116
- Uh. hey. babe.
- Good morning.

56
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.350
Um. I. um. was thinking

57
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.672
that we could have
breakfast together.

58
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.638
Right?
Like a family.

59
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.518
- I love it.
- Yeah.

60
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.478
Do you... Hi.

61
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.518
- Do you need any help?
- No. no. You guys just sit.

62
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.436
Okay.

63
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.150
What... do we have here?

64
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.311
Well. these are pancakes.
as you can see.

65
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.871
but I made them
into little lightning bolts.

66
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.270
<i>Well. the batter
kind of got away from me.</i>

67
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.999
but you see
the little zigzag...

68
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.311
No. no. no. Yeah. yeah.
I totally see it. yeah.

69
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.278
<i>Yeah.</i>

70
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.520
What are... what are you doing?

71
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.398
Uh. I am
just getting evidence

72
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.917
that you make lumpy pancakes
in every time period.

73
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.879
Let's try it out.

74
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.233
Mmm. Lumpy. but delicious.

75
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.471
- Yeah? Oh. thanks. babe.
- Oh.

76
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.037
I'm sorry. um. when did you...
when did you get a phone?

77
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.351
Uh. Dad got it for me
a couple days ago.

78
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.874
Mm-hmm.

79
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.800
Nora suggested it. I mean.
I thought it was a great idea.

80
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.031
We're always in and out
of S.T.A.R. Labs. so I just...

81
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.760
you know. it'd be easier
to text and call.

82
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.513
Yeah.

83
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.069
Yeah. that totally
makes sense.

84
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.080
You guys excited
to cheer me on

85
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.560
at the charity softball game?

86
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.439
Softball. schway.

87
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.910
I just hope I don't get
stuck in right field this year.

88
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.992
You. uh. gave
your number out already?

89
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.879
Yeah. just to the team
and Sherloque.

90
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.038
Actually. this text message.
I think. is from him.

91
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.830
I don't think
he's much of a texter.

92
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.274
No.

93
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.556
He. uh. wants us to come
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

94
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.160
I'm gonna go get ready.

95
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.913
You haven't had anything
to eat yet.

96
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.640
Mm. I'm not really
a breakfast person.

97
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.240
You know.
I thought having her here.

98
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.936
we would finally
have a chance to connect.

99
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.156
but it's like every time
we take a half-step forward.

100
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.397
we end up taking
six steps back.

101
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.790
I-I mean. don't give up.
She'll come around.

102
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.678
I have a feeling.
Yeah.

103
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.630
Well. not if I keep
making food like that.

104
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.313
Hey. no. this really is good.

105
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.676
It is. I mean.
it's a little. like...

106
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.000
- Wait. wait. stop. Just stop.
- Dark. but... No. it's...

107
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.833
I'm going to make you
a banana. It's fine.

108
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.096
You're going
to make me a banana?

109
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.077
I'm going to make you
a banana.

110
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.992
Thanks.

111
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.396
Wait. no.
I asked for everyone.

112
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.394
Where is the little. uh...

113
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.432
Cisco is laying low
at his parents' house

114
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.432
while he heals up.

115
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.399
Well. that's not very brave
on his part.

116
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.791
I will have a conversation
with him next time I see him.

117
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.758
So. Team Flash.

118
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.036
How will this handsome.
master detective

119
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.992
of all the multiverse.
Sherloque Wells.

120
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.431
pay off his debt to us...

121
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.754
and catch this
homicidal maniac together?

122
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.296
Well. we'll begin
by asking ourselves

123
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.436
a few obvious questions.

124
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.398
How he became a meta-human?

125
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.880
Well.
power manifestation varies.

126
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.599
The particle accelerator...

127
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.376
I don't think we're
interrupting Sherloque. right?

128
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.880
- Right.
- Sure. but you bring up

129
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.360
a good point. Dr. Snow.

130
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.557
What do we know so far
about this Cicada?

131
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.632
Well. we know that
he's killed two people

132
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.871
and almost a third.

133
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.077
Exactly right.
If I could gently be

134
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.994
a little more specific.
not just people. right?

135
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.833
Meta-humans.

136
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.310
Also. Joe said he got the
feeling that Cicada's a dad.

137
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.438
Right. Cicada... parent.

138
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.591
His dagger dampens powers.

139
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.273
Not just dampens
the powers. right?

140
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.840
He commands this dagger. right?

141
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.474
It is like
an extension of himself.

142
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.233
So we know...

143
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.176
Maybe they acquired
their powers at the same time.

144
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.271
Yes. very good. Dr. Snow.

145
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.910
So. acquired powers...

146
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.673
<i>together.</i>

147
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.989
<i>So...</i>

148
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.436
there we are. Team Flash.

149
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.791
Very simple.

150
00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.678
We unravel this puzzle.

151
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.118
and we have a pathway
to tracking Cicada.

152
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.193
Cool. or we just answer
a much more basic question.

153
00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.075
like what's up
with his weird mask?

154
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.319
Well. the mask conceals
his identity.

155
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.993
- That's what it's for.
- Right.

156
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.270
What I'm suggesting is.

157
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.238
if we find out what
the mask is for.

158
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.152
we'll find out the man
underneath much faster.

159
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.960
37 times I have caught
Cicada. right?

160
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.556
And not once was this mask
angle very useful. right?

161
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.552
But you know what?

162
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.235
The more hours I bill you.
the less money I owe you.

163
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.256
So. if you want to spend your
hours pursuing the mask angle.

164
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.397
well. then be my guest.

165
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.838
Okay. great.
Sounds like a plan.

166
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.639
- We got to get going.
- Yeah. yes.

167
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.870
Good stuff.

168
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.078
I hope you score a touchdown.

169
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.119
- It's softball.
- Ah. score a basket.

170
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.669
So. baby giraffe...

171
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.229
lead on. my friend.

172
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.676
Wow.

173
00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.080
Look at these guys.

174
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.676
They think they're
so much better than us.

175
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.479
Because they are. Bar.

176
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.029
I mean. without Captain Singh
or my dad. it's...

177
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.634
Huh.

178
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.316
- Huh. what?
- Jonesy isn't here yet.

179
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.119
Hey. Detective Rowell.
what do you think?

180
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.351
- Maybe third base for me?
- Right field. Allen.

181
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.511
Babe. I love you.
but leave the hot corner

182
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.757
to someone who can actually
field a ball. okay?

183
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.115
<i>- Play ball!</i>
- Come on.

184
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.999
- I mean... Good luck!
- Yeah.

185
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.869
- You're going to nail it.
- Right field.

186
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.158
- Oh. God.
- In right field.

187
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.830
Not the hot corner. but...

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.633
Yeah. Papa Joe told me all
the stories

201
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.030
about what an awful athlete
Dad was growing up.

202
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.679
Well. believe me.
they're true.

203
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.638
Let's just be grateful
that he has coordination

204
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.552
- when it counts.
- Yeah.

205
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.950
Hey. what is that. Nora?

206
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.680
You know. it's this really great
app called Spyn Zone.

207
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.560
The push notifications
let you know the second

208
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.438
anything happens in the city.

209
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.034
Like Iris' Website?

210
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.793
Uh. yeah. kind of.

211
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.593
It's just a lot more
up to date than that.

212
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.239
and it's. like...
it's really cool.

213
00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.518
This girl's. like.
really in the know.

214
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.239
<i>Oh.</i>

215
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.312
Yeah. Spencer Young.
I know her.

216
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.520
Yeah. I see her all the time

217
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.040
working on her laptop
at Jitters.

218
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.271
She... she actually was
a junior reporter at CCPN

219
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.760
when I worked there.
but...

220
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.320
she didn't last very long.

221
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.557
- Why not?
- Well. she wanted to be famous

222
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.994
and make a name for herself.

223
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.296
but she didn't care
how it happened.

224
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.959
Well. I think she's cute.

225
00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.599
Yeah. I mean.
she may be cute.

226
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.876
but she's never fact-checked
a thing a day in her life.

227
00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.416
She's doing something right...
she has three times

228
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.638
as many followers on her app
as you do on your blog. so...

229
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.236
I'm going to get something
to eat.

230
00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.232
- Ooh
- Wow.

231
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.077
<i>- Ah. come on. Allen!</i>
- Oh. honey.

232
00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.196
Oh.

233
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.072
- Cecile? What's wrong?
- Something's not right.

234
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.310
Something's not right.

235
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.917
Is that Jonesy?

236
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.879
Hey. somebody stop him!

237
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.872
Everybody move!

238
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.515
<i>Hey. hey!</i>

239
00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.990
- Nora. hey.
- Huh? What?

240
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.753
What happened?

241
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.593
You just saved everybody.

242
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.120
Bomb squad finished
their sweep.

243
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.112
- They said it's all clear.
- Okay.

244
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.351
Nora. how did you know
what was happening?

245
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.909
I don't know.

246
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.514
One minute I was going
to get food.

247
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.035
and the next I was
in the outfield with Dad.

248
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.560
And you don't remember
anything else?

249
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.077
What's that?

250
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.311
A notification
from Spyn Zone.

251
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.834
Already? That was fast.

252
00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.593
Allen. CSI time.

253
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.751
Uh. we're up. We'll meet you
back at S.T.A.R. Labs

254
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.196
- as soon as we can.
- Yeah.

255
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.637
Iris.
if Cicada sees that post...

256
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.236
Yeah. he may pick Nora
as his next target.

257
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.080
Well. you have brought us
to the location

258
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.958
you first encountered
Cicada.

259
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.554
That's right.
How did you know that?

260
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.256
I know everything.
I'm a master detective.

261
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.056
Look. I looked at
the CSI file of Barry Allen.

262
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.834
There is no evidence
of Cicada DNA. right?

263
00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.116
And moreover.
look at this location. right?

264
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.336
All the traffic through here...

265
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.192
you can never pull DNA
from here.

266
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.536
It's a good thing
we're not here for DNA.

267
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.789
What we are here for. then?

268
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.236
We're here to find out
why Cicada wears that mask.

269
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.959
Oh. <i>encore</i> with the mask!

270
00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.600
Do you think he's allergic
to fresh air?

271
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.717
- No.
- No. he wears that mask

272
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.916
for a reason.

273
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.515
All right. look. 37 times
I've caught Cicada.

274
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.432
Not once. not one time
was the mask

275
00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.480
- a key part of the evidence.
- Yeah. that's true.

276
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.496
But you said this Cicada is
different than all the others.

277
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.671
so why wouldn't his mask
be different. too?

278
00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.150
Maybe it's just a mask to...
You know what?

279
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.960
You want to pursuit mask angle.
be my guest.

280
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.918
What do you expect
to find here?

281
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.151
When I was getting
my ass kicked.

282
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.816
I noticed that the more
he exerted himself.

283
00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.354
the heavier his breathing got.

284
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.193
- That's what happens.
- So. I thought...

285
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.840
if one of those breaths
was strong enough...

286
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.719
We might just get lucky.

287
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.837
How we are going
to get lucky?

288
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.037
Barry found traces
of fluoropolymers here.

289
00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.713
- So?
- So the Internet told me

290
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.029
they're prone to flaking.

291
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.351
I'm here to get some of them.

292
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.416
The Internet also tell you to
contaminate your crime scene?

293
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.954
Very good.
master detective.

294
00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.677
Turns out
industrial respirators use

295
00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.136
a protective coating
around the nostrils

296
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.514
that are made from this.

297
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.936
And when this exposed
to another compound.

298
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.350
dimethyl sulfate.
fluoropolymers tend to emit

299
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.590
a very distinct odor.

300
00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.830
Burnt onions.

301
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.429
Right.

302
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.837
We find out
where this is used.

303
00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.877
we're going to find our man.

304
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.077
- Elementary.
- Elementary.

305
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.152
No shrap. Sherlock.

306
00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.917
It's Sherloque.

307
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.277
Spencer?

308
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.033
Iris West. wow.

309
00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.839
Long time.
How are you?

310
00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.991
Uh. yeah. yeah.
I'm good. And you?

311
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.079
Good. Married that CSI guy
you were dating. huh?

312
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.389
Uh. yeah.

313
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.518
- Any kids yet?
- Um. no. Not...

314
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.319
Uh...

315
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.675
No.

316
00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.513
You know.
I followed your lead.

317
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.671
Started my own blog.
left CCPN.

318
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.951
Now we are both
Charleine Foster Kanes.

319
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.394
Right.

320
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.676
BTdubs. those Professor DeVoe
stories... respect.

321
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.752
Metas are clickbait
right now. right?

322
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.833
Yes. which is why I wanted
to talk to you. actually.

323
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.070
off the record.
of course.

324
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.560
Yeah. for sure.
What's up?

325
00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.599
So. uh. I recently found
a source who thinks

326
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.592
that metas
are being targeted.

327
00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.592
Ooh. juicy.
Who?

328
00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.673
Well. no one knows.
not even CCPD.

329
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.240
But these metas.
including speedsters

330
00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.711
like The Flash and XS.
they are all in danger.

331
00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:00.033
XS. That new lady speedster
has a code name.

332
00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.635
Oh. like her size!

333
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.598
Right. extra small.

334
00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.354
- Did you coin that?
- No. no.

335
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.558
Look. the point is.
writing articles about XS

336
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.199
could make her a target.

337
00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.919
Or it could make her famous.

338
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.151
I mean. people are already
obsessed with her...

339
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.560
and my app even more.

340
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.155
Besides. a little threat
never stopped you

341
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.119
from writing about
The Flash back in the day.

342
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.714
That was different.

343
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.511
Because it was <i>your</i> blog?
What... do as I say. not as I do?

344
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.115
Look. please stop. okay?
Before someone gets hurt.

345
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.880
The only one who's going
to get hurt is you

346
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.350
when I make
your blog irrelevant.

347
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.196
<i>What is this for. Allen?</i>

348
00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.432
Just trying to get
some answers. Jonesy.

349
00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.159
Would you send that to Caitlin?

350
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.709
I told everyone everything
I know. which is nothing.

351
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.520
- You don't remember a thing?
- No.

352
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:59.396
Okay. God's own truth. Allen...
all I remember is waking up.

353
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.512
getting ready for the game.
leaving my house.

354
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.672
and the next thing I know.
I wake up in the field

355
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.638
after that bomb went off.

356
00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.633
I mean. where would
I even get a bomb?

357
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.949
<i>The evidence lockup.</i>

358
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.833
It was part of
the inventory we seized

359
00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.479
from the Jansen-Moretti case.

360
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.837
The cameras in the lockup
show you stuffing that bomb

361
00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.560
in your backpack this morning.

362
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.319
- Joe. no one got hurt.
- They could've.

363
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:31.030
The woman I love. my baby...
you could've killed them.

364
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.720
I watched you come up. man.

365
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.360
I'm sorry. Joe...

366
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.672
but I swear. I don't know
how this happened.

367
00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.397
Move. move!

368
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.200
- How many we got?
- Hey. what is it?

369
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.757
Fire at CCPN. First
responders are across town.

370
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.593
We got to go.

371
00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.430
Finally.

372
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.318
Okay. the building's
already been evacuated.

373
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.720
Fire trucks are on their way.

374
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.911
Okay. let's just get inside
and put the fire out.

375
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.719
I've never done this before.

376
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.235
Come on.
Seriously. move!

377
00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.240
That's okay. We're just going
to create a vacuum.

378
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.390
Fine.
I will make you move.

379
00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.240
Enjoy this news. Flash.

380
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.896
All right. I'll walk you
through it. Once we're inside...

381
00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.632
What? Where...
where are you going?

382
00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.720
Nora. what's wrong?

383
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.235
He just ran away and left.

384
00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.518
His suit's GPS
has him west. way west.

385
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.910
Barry? Barry.

386
00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.674
He's not listening.

387
00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.798
Uh. guys.
what do I do here?

388
00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.936
Okay. Nora. you're going
to have to do this by yourself.

389
00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.314
Okay? But I'm going
to help you.

390
00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.914
Okay.

391
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.696
Okay. you need to get
to the heart of the fire

392
00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.360
and extinguish it from there.

393
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.159
- I got it.
<i>- Rotate your arms</i>

394
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.118
in tight circles.

395
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.696
You need to move them
in opposite directions.

396
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.120
creating twin vacuums.

397
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.556
Come on. Nora.

398
00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.711
Dad's done this
a thousand times.

399
00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.280
You can do this.

400
00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.634
I'm doing it!

401
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.518
Keep going.

402
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.355
Whoa.

403
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.520
Great job. Nora.

404
00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.319
Thanks. Mom.

405
00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.558
Hey... hey. did you find Dad?

406
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.034
What the hell?

407
00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.838
I'm glad you were there
to put that out.

408
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.720
- It could've been a lot worse.
- Thanks. Dad.

409
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.476
Don't thank me. Your mom
walked you through it.

410
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.638
You were really great
out there.

411
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.872
So there was some
weird activity with your scan.

412
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.680
but everything looks fine.

413
00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:34.910
Hmm.

414
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.719
What's the last thing
you remember?

415
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.951
Standing outside
CCPN with Nora.

416
00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.838
Next thing I know.
I'm in Vegas.

417
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.719
That's exactly what happened
to me and Officer Jones.

418
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.154
So maybe
the abnormal activity

419
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.391
was some sort
of hypnotic induction?

420
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.136
I don't know. I mean.
I feel like one of us

421
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.856
would've noticed somebody
trying to hypnotize me.

422
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.080
Yeah. and why would someone
hypnotize us to save people?

423
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.316
Publicity.

424
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.040
Spencer Young wants to get
famous by making you famous.

425
00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.236
You don't know that.

426
00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.834
She admitted it
when we talked.

427
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.798
Why would you go talk to her?

428
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.276
Hold on. look at
the timestamp on the post.

429
00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.671
7:52 p.m.? Nora and I were
still with Jonesy.

430
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.229
and the fire at CCPN
hadn't even been reported yet.

431
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.096
I guess you'll always be
the first one to the scoop

432
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.634
if you're the one making it.

433
00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.837
So she's some sort
of early edition meta

434
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.990
who creates stories?

435
00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.356
Fake news taken
to a whole new level.

436
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.318
Maybe she's some kind
of meta psychic

437
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.880
who predicts the news.

438
00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.997
That still doesn't mean
she hypnotized us.

439
00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.952
Yeah.

440
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.197
Caitlin. can you download
the cortical biometrics

441
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.511
from Nora's suit and run it
against my scans?

442
00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.478
On it.
Thanks.

443
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.950
What are you thinking?

444
00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.635
We need to figure out if
Spencer's responsible for this.

445
00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.793
Google for the win
on finding out

446
00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.896
- where Cicada's mask is from.
- Google for the win.

447
00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.593
So you think
Cicada's hiding out here.

448
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.160
just lurking behind
those doors.

449
00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.520
Yeah. as a matter
of fact. I do.

450
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.416
because my search also told me
that Szrek Chemicals

451
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.909
uses dimethyl sulfates
in most of their products.

452
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.471
So guess what?
I'm gonna take down Cicada.

453
00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.438
Oh. well. we shall see.
giraffe.

454
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.513
May I help you?

455
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.752
- Hi. how are you? I'm...
- Elongated Man. I know.

456
00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.634
Sherloque Wells. yes.
master detective.

457
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.200
You know. we'll sign autographs
later... we have some business.

458
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.072
Uh. we just want to know
if we can ask you

459
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.389
some questions. please.

460
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.630
About?

461
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.038
What about our masks?

462
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.032
Do any of your employees
wear them?

463
00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:44.680
Follow me.

464
00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.755
Yep. Every worker.
every plant wears one.

465
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.320
How many plants?

466
00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.119
Three in Central City
and Keystone.

467
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.511
- Mm.
<i>- 14 in the Midwest alone.</i>

468
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.950
So probably thousands?

469
00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.238
Yeah. and we aren't the only
facility that uses them.

470
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:21.955
Thank you for your time.

471
00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.793
Hey. I. uh...

472
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.679
Love that pear meme going
around the last few weeks.

473
00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.470
Classic.

474
00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.359
Mm. classic.
I have a suggestion for you.

475
00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.591
Maybe the next time you do
a Google search.

476
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.672
advance to page two.

477
00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.035
Hmm?

478
00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.672
<i>So here's the meta-watch.</i>

479
00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.879
Press that button. If Spencer's
a meta. it'll beep.

480
00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.758
And if she's meta...

481
00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.816
It means she could be
dangerous. so come right back.

482
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.275
Yes. One of us
would go with you.

483
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.670
but she knows both me
and your dad. so...

484
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.319
I got it.

485
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.312
Okay. we're here
if you need us. all ri...

486
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.869
Um...

487
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.032
I see her.

488
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.936
All you need to do is get
within five feet of her.

489
00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.235
<i>hit the button.
in and out.</i>

490
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.357
I know!

491
00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.033
You see what I mean?

492
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.996
Half-step forward.
six steps back?

493
00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.914
I mean. you guys did great
with the fire. though.

494
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.196
Thank you.

495
00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.317
You should totally name
one of your drinks

496
00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.830
after that new female
speedster. XS.

497
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.991
- Hey.
- Whoa. Hi.

498
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.400
Hi.
Sorry. Spencer.

499
00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.314
That's okay.
Do I know you?

500
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.869
- Uh-oh.
- Uh. Nora...

501
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.553
<i>you have to press the button.</i>

502
00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.474
Um. no.
No. you don't know me.

503
00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.279
- But you know me.
- Yes. I do.

504
00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.511
Uh. sorry.
You're Spencer Young.

505
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.592
I read all your stuff
on Spyn Zone.

506
00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.160
It's a really good app.

507
00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.118
It's fantastic stories
and really good writing.

508
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.600
I'm a... I'm a really big fan.

509
00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.911
<i>- Nora..</i>
- I always enjoy meeting a fan.

510
00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.273
Especially when they're
as adorable as you.

511
00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.113
What's happening?

512
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.079
She's flirting with
our daughter. I'll be back.

513
00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.118
What?
Hold down the fort.

514
00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.998
Iris. wait.

515
00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.480
Huh.

516
00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:37.112
- Do you have a name?
- Nora. hey.

517
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.511
- Wait. y-you know her?
- Uh. I do.

518
00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.512
Well. she's actually...

519
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.751
This is. actually...

520
00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.550
Did you want
to check your watch?

521
00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.553
I think we're running
a little bit late.

522
00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.872
- Right. yes. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

523
00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.031
All right. well.
I'm going to peace out.

524
00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.997
But I hope to meet
cute you again sometime.

525
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.116
Nora.

526
00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.358
Well. I guess
she's not meta.

527
00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.636
I guess not.

528
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.112
Oh. no. No. no. no.

529
00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.760
Nora... look. I don't care
that you think she's cute.

530
00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.754
She's dangerous. okay?
You need to stay away from her.

531
00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.752
She <i>could</i> be dangerous.

532
00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.600
Nora. I am trying
to protect you here.

533
00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.434
Has that been
your thing my whole life?

534
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.354
What does that even mean.
honestly?

535
00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.397
I mean. is that why
you've been so cold to me.

536
00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.240
why you don't want
to spend any time with me?

537
00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.272
I'm... I'm just trying
to get to know you.

538
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.194
- Just drop it.
- Nora. I don't under...

539
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.397
Look. you lied to me!

540
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.234
I would never lie to you.

541
00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.159
Yeah?
What do you call that?

542
00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.000
You put a power-dampening chip
inside me

543
00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.474
to take away my speed.

544
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.789
And until six months ago.

545
00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.758
I didn't even know
I had powers.

546
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.832
My whole life has been a lie

547
00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.616
because you have been trying
to protect me.

548
00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.031
Well. guess what?
I don't need you to do that.

549
00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.197
- Hey.
- Hey.

550
00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.840
- What you doing?
- Well. Nora blocked me.

551
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.798
So I'm trying to use
the quantum computer

552
00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.351
to access her phone and
force her to accept my calls.

553
00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.920
But I am no...

554
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.469
hacker.

555
00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.936
Don't you think that's
a little extreme?

556
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.758
Yes. Barry.
it's very extreme...

557
00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:47.072
and crazy and desperate. but
I am feeling extremely crazy

558
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.072
and desperate. okay?

559
00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.153
I thought giving her
space would. you know.

560
00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.640
have her eventually
come around.

561
00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.474
but it turns out
she's not the problem. I am.

562
00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.517
I mean. I don't know how
I could do something

563
00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.273
like that to her. Barry.

564
00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.033
Iris. you didn't do anything
to her.

565
00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:05.033
You can't blame yourself for
something future-you might do.

566
00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.271
Yes. I can. Barry.
and it's not a might.

567
00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.671
I suppressed
our daughter's powers.

568
00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.229
I kept a huge part
of who she was a secret

569
00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.360
for her entire life.

570
00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.079
I did that.

571
00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.913
Look. she'll forgive you.

572
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.878
What if my dad did something
like that to you

573
00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.759
after the particle accelerator
exploded?

574
00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.672
See?

575
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.993
I don't understand how I could
do something like that to her.

576
00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.754
Look. I don't know
why you do it.

577
00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.150
but I don't need to.

578
00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.472
I know that anything you do for
our family. it's out of love.

579
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.234
So. whatever reason future-you
has for doing this.

580
00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.551
I have faith that it's
the right thing to do.

581
00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.831
and so should you.

582
00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.639
Yeah. well. I'm having
a really hard time

583
00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.279
believing that.

584
00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.319
Well. then it's a good thing
I have enough faith in you

585
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.993
for the both of us.

586
00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.912
All right?

587
00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.239
That's unusual.

588
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.717
<i>Dr. Snow.</i>

589
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.314
Aah!

590
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.629
Oh. Dr. Snow.

591
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.518
I have frightened you.
Dr. Snow.

592
00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.910
I assume you came here
for some other reason

593
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.036
than murdering me?

594
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.396
Oof...

595
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.039
If I was to murder you.
Dr. Snow.

596
00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.157
I would not do it in such
an obvious fashion.

597
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.154
Look. I have a theory
on the identity of Cicada.

598
00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.959
I request your assistance.

599
00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.272
Uh. okay.
I was just finishing up.

600
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.397
Not your expertise.
your assistance.

601
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.319
I need you to punch me
in the chest.

602
00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.794
What?

603
00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.475
Right here. above the... um.
dee-aphragm. How do you say?

604
00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.676
Diaphragm?

605
00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.830
Diaphragm. right.

606
00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.389
In the solar plexus
as hard as you can. <i>Allé.</i>

607
00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.278
Listen. Sherlock...

608
00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.635
- Ugh.
- Loque.

609
00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.712
So this is one of those things

610
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.520
where you are just the brains
and not the brawn?

611
00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.831
You don't have the guts.
You lack the courage.

612
00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.960
You're soft.

613
00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.714
Probably you couldn't even
hit me in the spot.

614
00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.916
For the record.
I know what you just did.

615
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.912
- And?
- And it worked.

616
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.152
<i>Très bien.</i>
Then... <i>allé.</i>

617
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.713
Ooh!

618
00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.549
Oh. uh. are you okay?

619
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.596
You sound just like...

620
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.717
Cicada.

621
00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.593
<i>What do we got?</i>

622
00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.637
CCPD is getting bombarded
with calls from people

623
00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.598
at the soccer game
at Central City Stadium.

624
00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:41.955
It's all over
the news. too.

625
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.136
Okay. I'm going to get
over there.

626
00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.416
CCPD already cleared out
the stadium.

627
00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.976
Find the bomb.
and we'll help you disarm it.

628
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.435
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you on the way.

629
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.636
Come on.

630
00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.879
- Nothing. you?
- No.

631
00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.153
Iris. there's no bomb.

632
00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:12.274
Guys. look at the timestamp
on Spencer's post.

633
00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.033
11:05 a.m.

634
00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.873
Yeah. and now look at
the time that CCPD

635
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.680
got the first call
about the bomb sighting.

636
00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.995
It was five minutes later.

637
00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.151
Hey. can you bring up
Officer Jones' brain scan?

638
00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.594
I'm going to run the code

639
00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.592
of Spencer's post
through the decompiler.

640
00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.596
Let's see what's underneath.

641
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.875
Got it.

642
00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.393
Done. The brain scan.
The code is an exact match.

643
00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.790
- Barry. it's the headlines.
- What?

644
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.758
<i>That's how Spencer's
hypnotizing people.</i>

645
00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.595
They're reading her headlines!
Don't look at them.

646
00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.512
Aah! Too late!

647
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.400
Nora's been hypnotized.

648
00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:21.193
She's trying to kill me.

649
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.920
Nora. you got
to snap out of this.

650
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.437
What I have
to do is kill you.

651
00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.993
Caitlin. take over.

652
00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:45.676
- Where are you going?
- To get my family back.

653
00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.355
Hurry up
and kill him already.

654
00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.311
Time to bounce.

655
00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.598
Hey. you're going to be okay.
All right?

656
00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.592
Nice shot!

657
00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.434
Guys. do we know
where Spencer is?

658
00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.433
I can't ping her phone. CCPD
disabled all the cell towers

659
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.591
in the area to prevent
a remote bomb detonation.

660
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.637
She must be local
in order to put those headlines

661
00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.677
up on that
big screen. right?

662
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.150
- She's at the stadium.
- She's here.

663
00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.437
Looks like you'll be trading
this cell in for another.

664
00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.030
All right. Spencer's all locked
up in Iron Heights.

665
00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.952
- The Mayor's resigning.
- What?

666
00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.679
I'm surprised
she lasted this long.

667
00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.513
Luckily. I was able to get
a quote from her

668
00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.871
exonerating Officer Jones
for my article.

669
00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.077
Post will go up tomorrow.

670
00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.629
Papa Joe will be relieved
his friend's in the clear.

671
00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.200
Yeah.

672
00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.960
Well. at least now.
with Spencer behind us.

673
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.839
we can concentrate
on bigger fish.

674
00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.116
Yes. we can.

675
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.953
So...
Uh. Sherlock...

676
00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:38.590
- Sherloque.
- He thinks he's found a key

677
00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.114
to Cicada's identity.

678
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.193
A crucial clue to help us
solve our little mystery.

679
00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.795
So we all know the distinctive
sound of Cicada's breathing

680
00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.519
due to the respirator
in the mask.

681
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.560
But not just that. because
also his lungs are injured.

682
00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.233
But injured from what?

683
00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:56.154
Historically. there is an
event that causes David Hersch

684
00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:59.199
to always become Cicada.
but not this time.

685
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.999
There's a different Cicada
because...

686
00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.834
Because Nora helped me
destroy the satellite.

687
00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.439
<i>Monsieur Allen. Nora's strike</i>

688
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.520
<i>through the satellite</i>

689
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.035
changed the trajectory of
the debris. and now the debris

690
00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.794
has hit a new person
and injured...

691
00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.872
our new Cicada.

692
00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.872
Okay. but how did
that give him his powers?

693
00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.316
DeVoe flooded the satellite
with dark matter.

694
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.598
It makes sense that the pieces
would be saturated.

695
00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:26.320
So Cicada and the dagger
were created

696
00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.517
the night
of the Enlightenment.

697
00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.276
Acquired powers together.

698
00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.113
Well. listen. Sherloke...

699
00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.635
- Sherloque.
- I got to hand it to you.

700
00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.274
That's very impressive.

701
00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.149
It's quite a breakthrough.
right. Monsieur Dibny?

702
00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:45.233
One that I cannot take
any credit for.

703
00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.994
No. all the credit.
all the praise

704
00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.151
goes to you.
Monsieur Dibny.

705
00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.199
It was your instincts
to follow the mask. right?

706
00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.751
Well. you were right.
and I was...

707
00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.274
less right.

708
00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.912
I apologize.

709
00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.877
Okay. guys. I'm sorry.

710
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.536
The dagger part
still doesn't make sense.

711
00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:13.076
I mean. things can't
become metas. right?

712
00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.797
I don't know about that.

713
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.237
Our satellite didn't
just create new metas.

714
00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.233
It created meta-tech.

715
00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:33.030
Which puts meta-human
abilities in the hands of...

716
00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.156
anyone.

717
00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.560
Hey.

718
00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.280
Caitlin says
you're going to be fine.

719
00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.356
I'm sorry for suppressing
your powers. but...

720
00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:06.114
I think it was
the right thing to do.

721
00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.317
Yeah. No. I-I...

722
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.393
I get it. I mean.
I was trying to kill Dad.

723
00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.558
I would've done
the same thing. too.

724
00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.597
No. that's...

725
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.320
That's not what I mean.

726
00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.710
I'm talking about
in the future.

727
00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.033
What?

728
00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.800
I know that you're upset
and angry.

729
00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.679
And honestly. I...

730
00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.416
Before today. I couldn't
even imagine a situation

731
00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.194
where I would do something
like that to you.

732
00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.798
But after seeing the choice
that I just made...

733
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.396
I know that whatever reason
I would have

734
00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.996
for keeping your powers
a secret. it...

735
00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.913
it must have been
a good one. Nora.

736
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.151
It must have been
to protect you.

737
00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.754
No.

738
00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.436
What happened today...

739
00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:03.960
has nothing to do with what
happens in the future.

740
00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.431
<i>You didn't suppress
my abilities my whole life</i>

741
00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:12.276
because I was brainwashed
or attacking people.

742
00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.956
You did it to control me.

743
00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.432
My whole life
I felt like I was different

744
00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:24.911
than everybody else.
but I didn't know why.

745
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.878
You took a choice away
from me

746
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.873
that I didn't even know
that I had...

747
00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:37.240
A choice to be a hero.
like my dad.

748
00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.113
What's going on?

749
00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.639
- Nothing. we're just talking.
- No.

750
00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.157
Mom thinks that she had good
reason to suppress my powers

751
00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.678
in the future. but she doesn't
know what that reason is.

752
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.755
I'm sure it's a good one.

753
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.280
Look. Nora. I don't have
to visit the future

754
00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.795
to know what kind of mother
Iris is going to be.

755
00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:13.840
She cares about family
more than anyone I've ever met.

756
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.151
<i>Okay? And...</i>

757
00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.357
I support her decisions...

758
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.234
past. present. and future.

759
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.313
Then I guess I need
to rethink what the meaning

760
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.960
of family is.

761
00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:34.316
Nora. wait.

762
00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.278
Do you know what hurt
the most

763
00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.238
about learning I had powers?

764
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.959
Not hearing it from my mom.

765
00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.633
It's all right.

766
00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.118
- Hi.
- Nora. hi.

767
00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.432
Um. it's kind of
a long story.

768
00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.876
but can I stay here?

769
00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.309
Get in here. kid.

770
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.316
Are you sure it's
not too much trouble?

771
00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.916
It's fine. Maybe talk
about the reason later?

772
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.789
But for now. there's some fresh
pillows and blankets upstairs.

773
00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.076
Thanks. Papa Joe.

774
00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.790
Aah!

775
00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.274
<i>Greg. move your head.</i>
