<b>If we let her go, she'll find eight more puppets

<b>That'd be far more dangerous, right?</b>

06:53.720 --> 06:57.180

<b>This sure looks like a lot more 
than a hundred to me, though.</b>

08:11.090 --> 08:12.880
<b>It's fine.</b>

08:13.510 --> 08:15.850
<b>We need about this many to start with.</b>

08:16.510 --> 08:20.770
<b>A few dozen will die during the tests, anyway.</b>

08:20.770 --> 08:24.810
<b>So the weak will cull themselves, you say?</b>

08:24.810 --> 08:25.730
<b>Indeed.</b>

08:26.940 --> 08:29.650
<b>I'll train seven of the most elite.</b>

08:30.820 --> 08:32.490
<b>Understood.</b>

08:32.490 --> 08:35.530
<b>Then we'll take the rest of them.</b>

<b>It'll be okay.</b>

09:50.230 --> 09:53.650
<b>Yeah. Thanks, Sis.</b>

09:54.530 --> 09:57.110
<b>So those two sisters are to be part of the seven?</b>

09:57.110 --> 10:00.830
<b>No. We don't allow siblings to belong to the same team.</b>

10:01.490 --> 10:04.080
<b>We can't have them growing dependent on each other.</b>

10:08.000 --> 10:12.090

<b>Yeah! I've recovered a lot, haven't I?</b>

11:20.910 --> 11:25.330
<b>Now we just have to wait for Lubb to return and use his Relic to sew my arm back on.</b>

<b>Huh? You can reattach your arm?</b>

12:25.970 --> 12:26.970

12:32.560 --> 12:37.230
<b>So all my toys besides Natala

12:37.230 --> 12:40.990

13:04.930 --> 13:06.970
<b>I've lost my Imperial Relic.</b>

13:07.390 --> 13:08.180

13:21.650 --> 13:24.950

13:25.360 --> 13:29.070
<b><i>So I have no idea what she'll do

13:29.070 --> 13:32.910

13:33.450 --> 13:34.370
<b>I see.</b>

13:34.790 --> 13:36.290
<b>So Bols was taken care of.</b>

13:36.290 --> 13:39.080
<b>And Chelsea's going after Kurome alone.</b>

13:39.080 --> 13:43.340
<b>Boss, when Kurome dodged my shot earlier,</b>

13:43.340 --> 13:46.970
<b>I felt like there was more to it than just the drug we've heard about.</b>

13:46.970 --> 13:50.350
<b>Maybe there's something about Kurome 
that even Akame doesn't know.</b>

13:50.930 --> 13:54.140
<b>We don't know for sure whether Chelsea will be successful.</b>

13:54.140 --> 13:56.440
<b>We should send reinforcements as quickly as possible.</b>

13:56.440 --> 13:59.360
<b>Akame, Tatsumi, you heard her.</b>

13:59.360 --> 14:01.400
<b>I know you haven't fully recovered,</b>

14:01.400 --> 14:03.530

14:03.900 --> 14:04.690

14:04.690 --> 14:05.990
<b>We'll head there right away.</b>

14:07.150 --> 14:09.660

14:09.660 --> 14:11.740

<b><i>Hmm, what is this?</i></b>

14:15.410 --> 14:19.170
<b><i>This unnerving feeling I can't quite put my finger on?</i></b>

14:19.580 --> 14:21.960
<b><i>She hasn't really given me an opening, either.</i></b>

14:21.960 --> 14:24.050
<b><i>Maybe I'll retreat for now and finish her later.</i></b>

14:24.590 --> 14:27.420
<b>The captain will probably be back soon.</b>

14:27.420 --> 14:29.010

14:30.720 --> 14:32.930
<b>A-Are you okay, Kurome?</b>

14:33.970 --> 14:36.430

14:38.140 --> 14:40.980

had been assassinated.</i></b>

18:43.970 --> 18:47.100
