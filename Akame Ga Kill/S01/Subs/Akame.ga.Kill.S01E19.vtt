<b>And your arm!</b>

10:37.360 --> 10:40.820
<b>You just gave Coro time to recover.</b>

10:40.820 --> 10:42.490
<b>Evil sure is stupid.</b>

10:42.990 --> 10:44.160
<b>Let's go, Coro!</b>

10:47.120 --> 10:48.460
<b>Where did that firepower come from?</b>

10:48.960 --> 10:50.830
<b>I've been waiting for this.</b>

10:50.830 --> 10:53.670
<b>For the moment when this battle 
became truly two-against-one.</b>

10:54.340 --> 10:59.630
<b>The more trouble I'm in, 
the stronger Pumpkin grows.</b>

10:59.630 --> 11:01.180
<b>Coro, tough it out!</b>

11:01.180 --> 11:03.800
<b>There's no way she can keep up this attack for long.</b>

11:04.260 --> 11:05.390
<b>That's true.</b>

11:05.390 --> 11:09.230
<b>But since we've fought before, 
I know where his weak spot is.</b>

11:09.640 --> 11:11.560
<b>I won't need long.</b>

11:11.560 --> 11:12.400
<b>Crap.</b>

11:12.400 --> 11:13.940
<b>Coro, last resort!</b>

11:22.570 --> 11:23.950
<b><i>I was waiting for that.</i></b>

11:23.950 --> 11:27.160
<b><i>I already know all your Relic's moves!</i></b>

11:30.210 --> 11:32.000
<b>Enma's Spear of Justice!</b>

11:42.430 --> 11:45.050
<b><i>Looks like she's packing more trouble than last time.</i></b>

11:45.050 --> 11:46.180
<b><i>That artillery...</i></b>

11:46.180 --> 11:48.100
<b><i>It's no Relic, but it sure is powerful!</i></b>

11:51.390 --> 11:53.400
<b>You bitch!</b>

11:58.070 --> 12:01.360
<b>I'll beat you black and blue!</b>

12:09.290 --> 12:11.580
<b>With my injuries...</b>

12:11.580 --> 12:13.580
<b>Damn it. I couldn't finish her.</b>

12:23.760 --> 12:25.640
<b>So this is why they say her body will shock you, huh?</b>

12:31.560 --> 12:33.440
<b>Oh, I broke a nail on that one.</b>

12:33.940 --> 12:34.730
<b>You...</b>

12:35.230 --> 12:39.690
<b>I was surprised to hear someone defeated Ibara, let alone Mez.</b>

12:39.690 --> 12:42.320
<b>But it seems that it wasn't you.</b>

12:42.320 --> 12:45.700
<b>I can tell how inexperienced you are in actual combat.</b>

12:46.070 --> 12:48.160
<b><i>I'm still too weak.</i></b>

12:49.120 --> 12:51.410
<b><i>I've had so many regrets.</i></b>

12:52.870 --> 12:54.080
<b><i>Too many!</i></b>

12:55.920 --> 12:58.420
<b><i>If there's a world of difference 
between us, I have to overcome it!</i></b>

13:10.220 --> 13:12.140
<b>Have you fully recovered, Coro?</b>

13:14.350 --> 13:14.890
<b>Good.</b>

13:15.350 --> 13:18.150
<b>We'll attack from both sides at once.{end of part a}</b>

13:28.320 --> 13:29.660
<b>Natala! Doya!</b>

13:30.080 --> 13:33.080
<b>Hey, Su. How's it going?</b>

13:33.080 --> 13:34.040
<b>Smoothly.</b>

13:34.330 --> 13:38.000
<b>We're taking care of the enemies here as ordered.</b>

13:39.250 --> 13:42.590
<b>I don't have time to play with you.</b>

13:43.460 --> 13:44.800
<b>Where's Sis?</b>

13:44.800 --> 13:46.380
<b>Before that,</b>

13:46.380 --> 13:50.510
<b>how about I rip off your left arm, 
like you did mine?</b>

13:51.850 --> 13:54.100
<b><i>I'm still injured from when 
that woman tried to kill me.</i></b>

13:54.100 --> 13:55.640
<b>Clench your teeth!</b>

14:01.400 --> 14:03.320
<b>Change of plans.</b>

14:03.940 --> 14:05.530
<b>I'll take you both on!</b>

14:07.450 --> 14:08.660
<b>Sorry I'm late, Kurome.</b>

14:11.080 --> 14:13.370
<b>You wanna get blown away by Su again?</b>

14:13.830 --> 14:15.790
<b>Come at me, lowly assassins.</b>

14:16.290 --> 14:19.330
<b>I won't allow you to hurt any more of my friends!</b>

14:20.000 --> 14:24.170
<b>Grand Chariot!</b>

14:28.880 --> 14:30.680
<b>G-General Esdeath...</b>

14:30.680 --> 14:32.390
<b>What are the Jaegers doing?</b>

14:32.390 --> 14:33.510
<b>Shut your mouth.</b>

14:33.510 --> 14:35.600
<b>This is happening because you underestimated Night Raid</b>

14:35.600 --> 14:37.770
<b>and let the Four Rakshasa Demons play around.</b>

14:37.770 --> 14:39.520
<b>P-Protect me.</b>

14:39.520 --> 14:41.610
<b>That's an order from the prime minister—</b>

14:41.610 --> 14:44.860
<b>Well, orders are orders.</b>

14:44.860 --> 14:46.940
<b>I will keep you safe.</b>

14:46.940 --> 14:49.360
<b>So don't set foot outside this room.</b>

14:49.780 --> 14:51.870
<b>Y-Yes...</b>

14:51.870 --> 14:54.950
<b>Hiding in the ruins won't do you any good.</b>

14:54.950 --> 14:58.540
<b>Eventually, you'll run out of strength.</b>

14:58.540 --> 15:02.170
<b>That's right. So I'm sorry, but I'll be taking you down with brute force!</b>

15:02.920 --> 15:04.630
<b>Rakshasa Demon!</b>

15:06.340 --> 15:06.710
<b>Wait...</b>

15:06.710 --> 15:08.720
<b>Th-This is too much.</b>

15:08.720 --> 15:10.510
<b>Don't think you can run.</b>

15:10.970 --> 15:12.090
<b>I'll bury you!</b>

15:32.070 --> 15:34.320
<b><i>This reminds me.</i></b>

15:35.450 --> 15:38.200
<b><i>Back when I was discriminated against for my heritage,</i></b>

15:39.200 --> 15:41.580
<b><i>all I could do was stare up into the sky.</i></b>

15:42.500 --> 15:45.710
<b><i>No one would help me.</i></b>

15:46.670 --> 15:47.920
<b><i>And that's when I understood...</i></b>

15:48.840 --> 15:51.760
<b><i>that only I could help myself.</i></b>

15:56.100 --> 15:59.890
<b><i>And that all my misfortunes were necessary.</i></b>

16:00.430 --> 16:03.940
<b><i>Because I'm going to change this unfair world.</i></b>

16:06.270 --> 16:07.110
<b><i>Which is why...</i></b>

16:14.450 --> 16:18.410
<b><i>There's no way I can die here!</i></b>

16:23.750 --> 16:29.170
<b><i>Don't underestimate my Pumpkin!</i></b>

16:29.170 --> 16:30.090
<b>Coro!</b>

16:31.050 --> 16:32.930
<b><i>My Ten Kings are all out of ammo,</i></b>

16:32.930 --> 16:35.050

16:37.640 --> 16:39.680
<b><i>Justice is served!</i></b>

16:40.560 --> 16:42.140
<b><i>This is it.</i></b>

16:43.640 --> 16:47.770
<b>Blast through!</b>

16:51.740 --> 16:54.490
<b>Sh-She sliced right through me?</b>

17:03.410 --> 17:06.250
<b>Pumpkin runs on my emotional energy.</b>

17:07.210 --> 17:10.710
<b>The more intense my emotions, the stronger it makes me.</b>

17:14.510 --> 17:16.130
<b>You made me snap.</b>

17:17.140 --> 17:18.970
<b>So you lose.</b>

17:25.480 --> 17:28.230
<b>Justice never loses.</b>

17:28.230 --> 17:31.110
<b>No matter the circumstances, evil will perish.</b>

<b>Judgment of the Ten Kings, Final Move:</b>

17:36.660 --> 17:38.820
<b>Chakravartin Furnace of Five Hells.</b>

17:40.160 --> 17:41.870
<b>One minute left.</b>

17:42.790 --> 17:44.790
<b>Don't tell me... You're self-destructing?!</b>

17:45.410 --> 17:50.590
<b>This is the ultimate evil-purging weapon I received from the doctor.</b>

17:50.590 --> 17:53.170
<b>So long as I have this in my head,</b>

17:53.170 --> 17:54.880
<b>I can't lose.</b>

17:54.880 --> 17:56.130
<b>You...</b>

17:57.090 --> 17:58.840
<b><i>No good. It's overheated.{um when was this rule invented??}</i></b>

18:01.260 --> 18:03.350
<b>With those injuries, you'll never get away in time.</b>

18:03.350 --> 18:06.350
<b>You're already sentenced to death by explosion!</b>

18:06.350 --> 18:07.940
<b>Perish in fear!</b>

18:15.690 --> 18:16.990
<b>I see...</b>

18:17.570 --> 18:19.450
<b>You can't regenerate anymore.</b>

18:20.240 --> 18:23.410
<b>But we haven't finished purging the world of evil.</b>

18:26.750 --> 18:28.420
<b>I don't want to die...</b>

18:29.120 --> 18:30.460
<b>like this...</b>

18:37.170 --> 18:39.890
<b>Damn it... My leg...</b>

18:39.890 --> 18:42.180
<b>You've got to be kidding.</b>

18:42.180 --> 18:46.100
<b>I have to survive, no matter what, and stand on the winning side!</b>

18:46.100 --> 18:49.100
<b>And I was finally able to avenge my friends, too.</b>

18:51.520 --> 18:54.230
<b>Who said you guys could flash before my eyes?</b>

18:54.230 --> 18:58.030
<b>There's no way I can leave this to you yet.</b>

19:04.580 --> 19:06.450
<b><i>Damn it all!</i></b>

19:27.220 --> 19:29.690
<b>I wasn't strong enough to save Bro...</b>

19:30.440 --> 19:32.940
<b>And I couldn't make it in time for Chelsea.</b>

19:35.730 --> 19:38.650
<b>But this time, I won't let any more of my friends die.</b>

19:40.700 --> 19:41.780
<b>Tatsumi...</b>

19:42.950 --> 19:44.030
<b>Looks like you're okay.</b>

19:50.330 --> 19:51.830
<b>I took your advice.</b>

19:51.830 --> 19:53.500
<b>Remember what you told me earlier?</b>

19:54.000 --> 19:56.750
<b>That I should help out when it counts.</b>

19:57.670 --> 19:59.210
<b>I did just that.</b>

19:59.210 --> 20:00.300
<b>What do you think?</b>

20:00.300 --> 20:02.430
<b>It really stuck in my mind, what you said.</b>

20:03.010 --> 20:04.890
<b>You're making it sound like I owe you one.</b>

20:04.890 --> 20:07.010
<b>I mean, could you have turned up any later?</b>

20:08.350 --> 20:09.220
<b>But...</b>

20:10.600 --> 20:12.560
<b>You really saved me.</b>

20:13.310 --> 20:14.440
<b>Thank you.</b>

20:15.770 --> 20:17.690
<b>S-Sure.</b>

20:21.400 --> 20:22.320
<b>Bolic...</b>

20:23.530 --> 20:24.660
<b>Where did he go?</b>

20:25.410 --> 20:27.370
<b>Bolic already ran away.</b>

20:28.080 --> 20:29.120
<b>Najenda...</b>

20:29.120 --> 20:31.710
<b>He ignored your warning.</b>

20:31.710 --> 20:34.460
<b>My subordinates should be 
finishing the job as we speak.</b>

20:35.580 --> 20:36.920
<b>Th-That was close.</b>

20:36.920 --> 20:37.920
<b>Holimaca!</b>

20:39.050 --> 20:41.130
<b>It was just a scratch, but...</b>

20:46.050 --> 20:49.680
<b>I see you still like to play dirty.</b>

20:49.680 --> 20:50.850
<b>Indeed.</b>

20:50.850 --> 20:54.480
<b>I know your strength better than anyone.</b>

20:54.940 --> 20:58.060
<b>Which is why I wouldn't dream of a frontal assault.</b>

21:01.110 --> 21:03.360
<b>Looks like we're done for now.</b>

21:03.360 --> 21:04.360
<b>Yeah.</b>

21:05.860 --> 21:07.320
<b>Hey, Tatsumi?</b>

21:08.580 --> 21:09.330
<b>What?</b>

21:11.200 --> 21:15.080
<b>After this battle's over, I want to talk to you about something.{are you fucking joking?}</b>

21:16.830 --> 21:18.080
<b>Can't you talk about it now?</b>

21:18.420 --> 21:20.050
<b>Nope.</b>

21:20.050 --> 21:20.840
<b>Huh?</b>

21:21.550 --> 21:25.050
<b><i>I'm surprised at myself.</i></b>

21:25.050 --> 21:28.760
<b><i>To think I'd end up wanting to survive for someone else's sake...</i></b>

21:30.560 --> 21:31.850
<b>Promise me something.</b>

21:32.470 --> 21:34.770
<b>That you'll survive, no matter what.</b>

21:35.890 --> 21:37.270
<b>Of course I will.</b>

21:43.440 --> 21:46.490
<b><i>Moving forward, we'll face even harsher battles.</i></b>

21:47.030 --> 21:49.910
<b><i>But as long as I have these feelings...</i></b>

21:49.910 --> 21:53.830
