<b>Why would someone like you join the Jaegers?</b>

<b>Back in my hometown, my students

<b>Whoa, what's that?</b>

10:45.490 --> 10:46.870
<b>What the hell is that?</b>

10:46.870 --> 10:49.870
<b>That's the legendary Imperial Relic...</b>

10:50.960 --> 10:54.250
<b>Shikoutazer? It truly exists?</b>

10:54.250 --> 10:55.550
<b>That prime minister...</b>

10:55.550 --> 11:00.430
<b>So this is why he hasn't admitted defeat.</b>

11:02.260 --> 11:06.220
<b>Our empire has lasted generations by the grace and will of God.</b>

11:06.930 --> 11:11.190
<b>None can defy God!</b>

11:31.420 --> 11:34.130
<b>Stop!</b>

11:40.340 --> 11:42.260
<b>My, Your Majesty...</b>

11:42.260 --> 11:44.930
<b>You look every bit as valiant 
as an emperor should be.</b>

11:44.930 --> 11:49.680
<b>I'm sure your parents would be proud, if not for the unfortunate accident which claimed their lives.</b>

11:50.140 --> 11:51.140
<b>Yeah.</b>

11:51.140 --> 11:56.940
<b>Shikoutazer can only be used by those of the imperial bloodline.</b>

11:56.940 --> 12:03.240
<b>That said, you are without 
doubt the true emperor!</b>

12:03.240 --> 12:04.700
<b>That's right.</b>

12:04.700 --> 12:07.410
<b>I am the true heir.</b>

12:07.410 --> 12:08.660
<b>Now, Your Majesty...</b>

12:08.660 --> 12:10.370
<b>Without further ado!</b>

12:21.090 --> 12:22.840
<b>So this is what Stylish was talking about.</b>

12:22.840 --> 12:26.140
<b>The oldest and most powerful Imperial Relic.</b>

12:31.520 --> 12:34.480
<b>This... This is the right thing to do.</b>

12:34.900 --> 12:36.650
<b>Splendid!</b>

12:37.860 --> 12:40.990
<b>As long as we have this power, none can defy us.</b>

12:40.990 --> 12:42.400
<b>Everything will be ours.</b>

12:42.860 --> 12:46.870
<b><i>Let's turn a blind eye toward the destruction that's about to take place.</i></b>

12:46.870 --> 12:48.530
<b><i>It'll work out.</i></b>

12:48.530 --> 12:53.370
<b><i>We'll just have the ignorant citizens 
rebuild it again for the emperor and me!</i></b>

13:03.170 --> 13:04.380
<b><i>They're powerful.</i></b>

13:04.380 --> 13:06.220
<b><i>I'd expect no less from the emperor's personal guard.</i></b>

13:11.020 --> 13:12.060
<b><i>Tatsumi!</i></b>

13:12.060 --> 13:13.390
<b>Stop!</b>

13:13.390 --> 13:15.560
<b>How can you treat your own capital this way?</b>

13:15.560 --> 13:17.270
<b>Night Raid!</b>

13:17.270 --> 13:20.690
<b>It is time for you to reap what you have sown!</b>

13:23.570 --> 13:25.280
<b>How could you turn on your civilians?</b>

13:25.280 --> 13:26.820
<b>What kind of emperor are you?</b>

13:26.820 --> 13:28.070
<b>What the hell are you protecting?!</b>

13:28.070 --> 13:29.280
<b>Shut up!</b>

13:29.280 --> 13:31.660
<b>This empire's lasted for a thousand years.</b>

13:31.660 --> 13:34.410
<b>I can't let it end with me!</b>

13:34.410 --> 13:38.000
<b>Yes, yes! That's exactly right, Your Majesty!</b>

13:38.540 --> 13:40.750
<b>What does it matter how long it's lasted?</b>

13:41.920 --> 13:46.380
<b>From the day I was born, 
I've shouldered the future of this empire.</b>

13:48.180 --> 13:51.100
<b>How could you possibly understand how I feel?!</b>

13:51.100 --> 13:52.640
<b>I hope I never do!</b>

13:53.100 --> 13:57.230
<b>Do you know how many people are suffering at your hands?</b>

14:03.230 --> 14:06.900
<b>Look down, and see what you've wrought!</b>

14:19.790 --> 14:20.710
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

14:20.710 --> 14:22.630
<b>You cannot listen to him!</b>

14:22.630 --> 14:26.220
<b>If you let him sway you now, 
all we've done will be for naught!</b>

14:26.220 --> 14:28.970
<b>You must harden your heart!</b>

14:28.970 --> 14:31.600
<b>Th-That's right, isn't it...</b>

14:31.600 --> 14:34.010
<b>Don't avert your eyes, you fool!</b>

14:44.270 --> 14:45.860
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

14:50.320 --> 14:52.660
<b>If you have this much power,{staircase tl: this little power}</b>

14:52.660 --> 14:54.910
<b>turn it on the real evil!</b>

14:54.910 --> 14:55.830
<b>Shut up.</b>

14:56.160 --> 14:59.330
<b>Are you okay with being a puppet?!</b>

14:59.330 --> 15:02.290
<b>Shut the hell up!</b>

15:06.630 --> 15:07.880
<b>Wave!</b>

15:08.550 --> 15:10.090
<b>I am a soldier of the empire.</b>

15:10.630 --> 15:12.850
<b>I fight to protect the people!</b>

15:12.850 --> 15:14.470
<b>Glad to hear it!</b>

15:15.850 --> 15:18.980
<b>P-Plus, I owe you one.</b>

15:21.440 --> 15:23.060
<b>Huh? From when?</b>

15:23.060 --> 15:24.570
<b>Uh, never mind.</b>

15:25.110 --> 15:27.990
<b>Your Majesty, please calm yourself!</b>

15:27.990 --> 15:29.780
<b>This is a holy war!</b>

15:29.780 --> 15:32.450
<b>I can't turn back now!</b>

15:34.160 --> 15:35.990
<b>We'll stop him, no matter what it takes.</b>

15:35.990 --> 15:38.910
<b>We're the only ones who can.</b>

15:38.910 --> 15:41.170
<b>Yeah, you don't have to tell me twice.</b>

15:41.170 --> 15:42.290
<b>You...</b>

15:42.290 --> 15:45.290
<b>You would dare bare your fangs 
against the empire?</b>

15:45.290 --> 15:47.090
<b>Don't misunderstand!</b>

15:47.090 --> 15:49.630
<b>I haven't joined the rebel forces.</b>

15:49.630 --> 15:53.720
<b>But protecting the powerless is a soldier's duty!</b>

15:56.930 --> 15:58.600
<b>He's a real pain, too.</b>

15:59.100 --> 16:00.060
<b>Indeed.</b>

16:00.060 --> 16:00.810
<b>But...</b>

16:01.980 --> 16:03.690
<b>He's a pain we need.</b>

16:11.700 --> 16:12.910
<b>Hey, Wings.{"birdbrain" is probably a little too insulting}</b>

16:12.910 --> 16:14.200
<b>We'll settle our fight later.</b>

16:15.490 --> 16:16.990
<b>Not if I can help it.</b>

16:20.450 --> 16:21.290
<b>It's too hard!</b>

16:23.540 --> 16:25.750
<b>N-Not even Grand Chariot can break through!</b>

16:28.460 --> 16:31.010
<b><i>We can still fight!</i></b>

16:31.010 --> 16:32.340
<b><i>If we give up,</i></b>

16:32.340 --> 16:33.220
<b><i>it'll be over!</i></b>

16:42.810 --> 16:44.650
<b>Wh-What was that?</b>

16:44.650 --> 16:45.350
<b>Tatsumi!</b>

16:48.110 --> 16:50.860
<b><i>What did I just hit?</i></b>

16:51.240 --> 16:55.280
<b>No matter how sturdy something may appear, 
it will usually have a weakness.</b>

16:56.410 --> 16:59.790
<b>If you can discover that weakness in battle, 
it will help you greatly.</b>

16:59.790 --> 17:01.330
<b><i>Su...</i></b>

17:01.330 --> 17:02.410
<b>Wave!</b>

17:02.410 --> 17:03.790
<b>Make an opening for me!</b>

17:04.920 --> 17:05.620
<b>Okay!</b>

17:05.620 --> 17:08.130
<b>Your Majesty, pass judgment on the traitors!</b>

17:08.130 --> 17:11.840
<b>Th-Those who betray the empire</b>

17:11.840 --> 17:13.550
<b>are sentenced to death!</b>

17:28.940 --> 17:31.400
<b>This one area's showing signs of wear.</b>

17:31.400 --> 17:34.110
<b>The Relic must weigh an immense amount.</b>

17:34.110 --> 17:36.240
<b>Which means it's weakest 
where the load is concentrated!</b>

17:36.240 --> 17:37.110
<b>Right, Su?</b>

17:37.530 --> 17:39.450
<b>How dare you?!</b>

17:42.790 --> 17:43.790
<b>Tatsumi—</b>

17:52.380 --> 17:53.920
<b>Give up.</b>

17:53.920 --> 17:56.050
<b>Why must you continue to struggle?</b>

17:57.010 --> 17:59.970
<b>I'm begging you, give up!</b>

17:59.970 --> 18:01.760
<b>Don't underestimate me.</b>

18:01.760 --> 18:05.060
<b>I've weathered countless tragedies to get here.</b>

18:05.060 --> 18:06.440
<b>And as each of my comrades fell,</b>

18:06.440 --> 18:08.400
<b>I've carried their dreams and hopes with me!</b>

18:08.400 --> 18:12.900
<b>I won't let them down!</b>

18:17.740 --> 18:20.320
<b>You'll face lots of pain and despair on the way.</b>

18:20.320 --> 18:22.870
<b>In fact, the very road we walk is paved with tragedy.</b>

18:22.870 --> 18:26.910
<b>But we are the ones who chose to walk it.</b>

18:26.910 --> 18:28.120
<b><i>Bro...</i></b>

18:28.710 --> 18:30.880

<b>and bring about a new world.</b>

18:33.340 --> 18:36.090
<b>And once it's all over, we can disappear.</b>

18:36.090 --> 18:37.380

18:37.380 --> 18:39.130
<b>Shout it out, Tatsumi!</b>
