<b>I performed an autopsy on the assassin we retrieved,

<b>Apparently, it's very profitable.</b>

<b>leading from the church to Bolic's mansion.</b>

09:48.350 --> 09:50.520
<b>If we can find the entrance,</b>

09:50.520 --> 09:52.780
<b>we could break straight into Bolic's basement.</b>

09:53.190 --> 09:54.940
<b>It might be difficult to find, though.</b>

09:54.940 --> 09:57.240
<b>After all, this area is pretty big.</b>

09:59.070 --> 10:01.530
<b>There might also be traps inside the passage.</b>

10:04.580 --> 10:06.250
<b>Why, hello there.</b>

10:06.250 --> 10:08.870
<b>Did you think you could hide,</b>

10:08.870 --> 10:10.670
<b>my sweet Akame?</b>

10:10.670 --> 10:11.710
<b>Ibara...</b>

10:11.710 --> 10:13.710
<b>You're here in Kyoroch?</b>

10:13.710 --> 10:16.590
<b>Oh, you remember me?</b>

10:16.590 --> 10:17.550
<b>I'm overjoyed.</b>

10:17.550 --> 10:21.890
<b>We never got to talk to each other in the Assassination Squad.</b>

10:21.890 --> 10:24.060
<b>I thought you Four Rakshasa Demons</b>

10:24.060 --> 10:28.190
<b>would be the last foes I'd have to face 
before assassinating the prime minister.</b>

10:29.850 --> 10:32.270
<b>You bad girl, betraying the empire like that.</b>

10:32.270 --> 10:34.900
<b>You deserve a spanking.</b>

10:38.530 --> 10:39.410
<b>Eliminate!</b>

10:39.410 --> 10:40.570
<b>Feel free to try!</b>

10:49.830 --> 10:53.630
<b>We Four Rakshasa Demons have not only 
undergone intense training,</b>

10:53.630 --> 10:57.760
<b>but we also grew up on the broth of the lake kraken that lives behind our temple in the mountains.</b>

10:57.760 --> 11:01.260
<b>It enables us to control every part of our bodies!</b>

11:03.390 --> 11:05.890
<b>Crap, they attacked out of nowhere!</b>

11:05.890 --> 11:06.970
<b>How did they see through me?</b>

11:08.060 --> 11:09.980
<b>Are you just gonna keep runnin', little boy?</b>

11:13.560 --> 11:15.820
<b>What? Dead already?</b>

11:15.820 --> 11:16.900
<b>I barely even hit you.</b>

11:17.740 --> 11:18.900
<b><i>Come on, old man...</i></b>

11:18.900 --> 11:21.410
<b><i>Hurry up and get out of here.</i></b>

11:21.410 --> 11:24.620
<b><i>I absorbed his punch by wrapping my body in wires,</i></b>

11:24.620 --> 11:28.750
<b><i>and inserted Cross Tail into my body to 
tie off my blood vessels and suppress my pulse.{uh okay dude}</i></b>

11:28.750 --> 11:32.880
<b>We shouldn't have even concerned ourselves with a weakling like him.</b>

11:32.880 --> 11:33.880
<b>How boring.</b>

11:33.880 --> 11:35.210
<b><i>Hurry up.</i></b>

11:35.210 --> 11:37.840
<b><i>How long do I have to play dead?</i></b>

11:37.840 --> 11:39.170
<b>Here you go, Sten.</b>

11:39.170 --> 11:40.880
<b>There's another one coming your way.</b>

11:40.880 --> 11:42.800
<b>She's another spy working for the rebels.</b>

11:42.800 --> 11:46.810
<b><i>Is that the girl I was supposed to meet?</i></b>

11:46.810 --> 11:49.390
<b><i>I'm sorry, but I can't save you.</i></b>

11:49.390 --> 11:53.520
<b><i>You should know the risks of being a spy.</i></b>

11:54.650 --> 11:58.030
<b>I see another lost child wandering through this world.</b>

11:58.280 --> 11:58.900
<b>Huh?</b>

11:59.190 --> 12:03.610
<b>Rejoice, for I shall free your soul.</b>

12:05.200 --> 12:06.740
<b>H-Help me...</b>

12:11.460 --> 12:13.920
<b>Yeah, as it turns out, I couldn't do it.</b>

12:13.920 --> 12:17.250
<b>I couldn't sit back and watch an ally die. 
Especially not a girl.</b>

12:17.630 --> 12:20.260
<b>I could've sworn you had no pulse.</b>

12:20.260 --> 12:21.550
<b>That was dumb.</b>

12:21.550 --> 12:24.010
<b>You should've just continued playing dead.</b>

12:24.930 --> 12:31.640
<b>Given my circumstances, I was trying my best to avoid close combat.</b>

12:32.480 --> 12:33.310
<b>However...</b>

12:33.310 --> 12:37.360
<b>If need be, I'll give it everything I've got.</b>

12:42.360 --> 12:45.030
<b>Both of you, come at me!{end of part a}</b>

12:48.080 --> 12:50.040
<b>Hey, hey, hey!</b>

12:50.490 --> 12:53.000
<b>That's a pretty sinister blade.</b>

12:53.000 --> 12:55.580
<b>Murasame, huh? It fits you perfectly.</b>

12:56.710 --> 12:57.790
<b>There, there, there!</b>

12:57.790 --> 13:00.000
<b>How's that, my sweet Akame?</b>

13:01.630 --> 13:04.300
<b>Like I said, we underwent intense training.</b>

13:04.300 --> 13:05.130
<b>Here we go!</b>

13:05.130 --> 13:06.590
<b>Your Relic's mine.</b>

13:13.430 --> 13:14.980
<b>What's with this sword?</b>

13:21.150 --> 13:23.820
<b>Don't tell me... this was your plan...</b>

13:23.820 --> 13:26.610
<b>You let go of your Relic on purpose?</b>

13:27.570 --> 13:31.120
<b>You called Murasame "sinister."</b>

13:31.120 --> 13:32.750
<b>I figured you wouldn't get along.</b>

13:34.000 --> 13:35.960
<b>How dare you...</b>

13:35.960 --> 13:38.080
<b>How dare you?!</b>

13:41.920 --> 13:44.880
<b>It seems this cursed blade ill suits you.</b>

13:49.550 --> 13:53.180
<b>Be happy that your soul is not as blackened as mine, Ibara.</b>

13:54.270 --> 13:56.810
<b>What a deadly woman.</b>

13:56.810 --> 13:59.900
<b>You've got me head over heels.</b>

14:07.280 --> 14:09.660
<b>I guess I can't catch you off guard.{alt: I see Pearl Harbor won't work on you.}{kyakka}</b>

14:10.030 --> 14:11.160
<b>A member of the Jaegers?</b>

14:11.160 --> 14:12.580
<b>Yes.</b>

14:12.580 --> 14:15.620
<b>And I've confirmed your presence, Akame of Night Raid.</b>

14:15.620 --> 14:17.790
<b>My role is reconnaissance.</b>

14:17.790 --> 14:22.130
<b>Thank you for demonstrating your Murasame to me.</b>

14:26.090 --> 14:28.470
<b>The Four Rakshasa Demons and the Jaegers...</b>

14:28.470 --> 14:30.550
<b>I hope the others are all right.</b>

14:31.220 --> 14:33.310
<b>Now, come at me!</b>

14:34.060 --> 14:35.140
<b>Why would I do that?</b>

14:35.140 --> 14:37.980
<b>You'll just ensnare me in those wires of yours.</b>

14:39.650 --> 14:40.900
<b>Yeah, I guess that was kinda obvious.</b>

14:42.730 --> 14:45.610
<b>Would you like me to free your soul for you?</b>

14:46.360 --> 14:47.860
<b>Koukenji...</b>

14:48.900 --> 14:50.360
<b>Hundred Fists!</b>

14:50.360 --> 14:53.330
<b>I wasn't talking to you, old man.</b>

14:55.200 --> 14:56.950
<b>You're rather skilled.</b>

14:57.540 --> 14:59.290
<b>So those wires are an Imperial Relic?</b>

15:00.120 --> 15:03.210
<b>That means you must belong to Night Raid.</b>

15:03.540 --> 15:06.960
<b>This time, I'll crack your skull in half 
and make sure you're dead.</b>

15:06.960 --> 15:10.930
<b>Please. I don't have time to flirt.</b>

15:11.720 --> 15:13.430
<b>Come together, my wires!</b>

15:15.850 --> 15:19.690
<b>Form, Centrifugal Force!</b>

15:19.690 --> 15:22.270
<b>Doesn't that technique leave you wide open?</b>

15:24.520 --> 15:26.150
<b>Not really.</b>

15:26.150 --> 15:26.980
<b>Take this!</b>

15:28.860 --> 15:30.450
<b>Secret Technique:</b>

15:30.450 --> 15:32.410
<b>Wire Impact!</b>

15:36.950 --> 15:37.950
<b>How feeble.</b>

15:38.700 --> 15:40.960
<b>Is <i>this</i> all you had up your sleeve?</b>

15:40.960 --> 15:42.170
<b>Don't make me laugh.</b>

15:42.170 --> 15:43.460
<b>Y-You think?</b>

15:44.000 --> 15:47.590
<b>I've already accomplished my goal, though.</b>

15:47.590 --> 15:48.710
<b>Look behind you.</b>

15:52.680 --> 15:54.340
<b>See you later!</b>

15:55.720 --> 16:00.430
<b>He used attention-drawing techniques to distract us from the woman.</b>

16:00.430 --> 16:02.310
<b>Well, what's done is done.</b>

16:04.980 --> 16:08.400
<b>I'll free your soul, even if I couldn't free hers!</b>

16:08.400 --> 16:11.030
<b>You sure you wanna charge at me like that?</b>

16:12.280 --> 16:18.200
<b>My wires are made from the hair of a mega-class Danger Beast which lives in the eastern clouds.{sounds like they'd be great for waxing and wanding your 3y3s when it's time to air the critical crystal in your castle on the moon. blue dragon.}</b>

16:18.200 --> 16:21.750
<b>The hair that protects its vitals is especially tough.</b>

16:21.750 --> 16:25.330
<b>Wire refined from it is particularly sharp—</b>

16:25.330 --> 16:27.590
<b>so sharp it's said to cut the world itself.</b>

16:29.130 --> 16:30.050
<b>What?</b>

16:30.050 --> 16:31.920
<b>This is my very strongest wire.</b>

16:31.920 --> 16:33.840
<b>I don't think even you can break it.</b>

16:40.270 --> 16:41.100
<b>Finishing strike!</b>

16:42.560 --> 16:44.440
<b>F-Feeble...</b>

16:44.440 --> 16:46.940
<b>I've honed my body more than anyone should be able to.</b>

16:46.940 --> 16:48.520
<b>A scratch like this couldn't possibly...</b>

16:48.520 --> 16:51.570
<b>It doesn't matter how tough your body is.</b>

16:51.570 --> 16:54.400
<b>The very moment Cross Tail pierced your body,</b>

16:54.400 --> 16:57.740
<b>its wires headed straight for your heart.</b>

17:07.250 --> 17:09.800
<b>You can strengthen your body, 
but you can't harden your heart.</b>

17:09.800 --> 17:12.210
<b>Wow, not bad.</b>

17:12.210 --> 17:13.880
<b>You managed to bring Sten down.</b>

17:13.880 --> 17:16.590
<b>The prime minister's gonna be pissed.</b>

17:16.590 --> 17:19.470
<b>Well, you don't have to worry about that.</b>

17:20.810 --> 17:23.680
<b>Sorry, but now that you've seen my Imperial Relic,</b>

17:23.680 --> 17:25.100
<b>I can't let you live.</b>

17:25.100 --> 17:26.770
<b>Don't be.</b>

17:26.770 --> 17:29.360
<b>It's only natural for an assassin.</b>

17:44.160 --> 17:45.910
<b><i>What the hell is that liquid?</i></b>

17:47.210 --> 17:48.130
<b><i>This is bad.</i></b>

17:48.130 --> 17:51.590
<b><i>With my wires weighed down like this, they're useless.</i></b>

17:51.590 --> 17:54.420
<b>This isn't oil, by the way. 
It's actually my sweat.</b>

17:54.420 --> 17:58.140
<b>The Four Rakshasa Demons are experts in body manipulation.</b>

17:58.140 --> 18:01.100
<b>Now you can't defend yourself with those wires anymore.</b>

18:04.140 --> 18:05.930
<b>Sh-She's fast!</b>

<b><i>I... I{'ve fallen and I} can't get up...</i></b>

18:16.280 --> 18:19.990
<b><i>If I take one more hit, it'll be the end.</i></b>

18:22.870 --> 18:23.620
<b>Take this!</b>

18:24.660 --> 18:26.290
<b>Please. Know when to quit.</b>

18:26.290 --> 18:27.410
<b>It's embarrassing.</b>

18:30.460 --> 18:33.130
<b>Damn, you're cute.</b>

18:33.130 --> 18:36.050
<b>If we weren't enemies, 
I definitely would've tried to pick you up.</b>

18:36.670 --> 18:39.970
<b>I don't dislike guys like you, 
so I probably would've let you.</b>

18:40.680 --> 18:41.510
<b>However...</b>

18:41.510 --> 18:43.890
<b>That'll have to wait for the next life.</b>

18:44.970 --> 18:46.220
<b>Bye-bye.</b>

18:53.320 --> 18:55.820
<b>I tied a wire to each of those knives.</b>

18:57.070 --> 19:01.950
<b>So when I reeled them in, 
the knives came along for the ride.</b>

19:07.790 --> 19:08.870
<b>Bye-bye.</b>

19:11.830 --> 19:14.000
<b>I gotta hurry and get outta here.</b>

19:16.840 --> 19:18.880
<b>Man, what a waste.</b>

19:18.880 --> 19:21.680
<b>Why do I have to get all the cute ones?</b>

19:23.180 --> 19:24.430
<b>Whew.</b>

19:24.430 --> 19:25.890
<b>We've searched the area a few times,</b>

19:25.890 --> 19:29.890
<b>but there are still many escape routes and secret paths to investigate.</b>

19:29.890 --> 19:31.810
<b>This place is way too big!</b>

19:31.810 --> 19:34.150
<b>That's exactly why we're scouting it out.</b>

19:35.360 --> 19:38.440
<b>I'd check the whole place and then some if I could just shop along the way.</b>

19:39.280 --> 19:42.990
<b>Your shopping takes forever, though. No thanks.</b>

19:42.990 --> 19:45.280
<b>Huh? No longer than any other girl.</b>

19:45.280 --> 19:47.830
<b>What kind of man won't let a woman enjoy her shopping?</b>

19:47.830 --> 19:49.040
<b>How petty.</b>

19:49.040 --> 19:52.460
<b>What kind of woman immediately labels a man's observations as "petty"?</b>

19:52.460 --> 19:53.790
<b>Now <i>that's</i> petty.</b>

19:53.790 --> 19:55.090
<b>I see how it is!</b>

19:55.090 --> 19:58.760
<b>You've got some nerve! Let's find out who's higher in the pecking order, here and now!</b>

19:58.760 --> 20:03.010
<b>It's messed up that you think there should be a pecking order in the first place!</b>

20:03.010 --> 20:05.300
<b>Please put a stop to this unproductive fighting.</b>

20:05.300 --> 20:05.800
<b>Huh?</b>

20:06.430 --> 20:07.390
<b>Who are you?</b>

20:07.390 --> 20:10.600
<b>My apologies for intruding on your conversation.</b>

20:10.600 --> 20:12.480
<b>I couldn't help but speak up.</b>

20:12.480 --> 20:15.020
<b>Are you perhaps the founder...</b>

20:15.020 --> 20:16.480
<b>...of Path of Peace?</b>

20:16.480 --> 20:17.400
<b>I am.</b>

20:17.400 --> 20:22.150
<b>Sometimes I patrol the outskirts of town to ensure everything is all right.</b>

20:22.150 --> 20:26.370
<b>I can clearly see that you two are bound by the red thread of fate.</b>

20:26.370 --> 20:29.540
<b>So instead of fighting, 
you should confess your love.{hi fts}</b>

20:29.790 --> 20:30.540
<b>What?</b>

20:30.540 --> 20:35.460
<b>If you became a couple, an occasional squabble would be good for you.</b>

20:36.040 --> 20:37.250
<b>What?</b>

20:37.250 --> 20:39.210
<b>What?!</b>

20:39.210 --> 20:41.050
<b>Why would I ever want to be with someone like him?</b>

20:41.050 --> 20:42.880
<b>Right back at you! I can't even stand you!</b>

20:42.880 --> 20:45.800
<b>I believe you two are meant for one another.</b>

20:47.430 --> 20:48.760
<b>Congratulations.</b>

20:48.760 --> 20:53.440
<b>You've been chosen as one of our lord's noble disciples.</b>

20:53.440 --> 20:54.980
<b>I-Is that true?</b>

20:54.980 --> 20:58.360
<b>To be able to witness our lord's miracles...</b>

20:58.360 --> 20:59.940
<b>It's like a dream come true.</b>

20:59.940 --> 21:03.990
<b>However, it would appear that 
wickedness yet lingers in your body,</b>

21:03.990 --> 21:05.990
<b>which makes you unfit for the role.</b>

21:05.990 --> 21:07.450
<b>N-No...</b>

<b>Remove your clothes.{lmao}</b>

<b>What is it?</b>

ushinau mono wa nai to kurikaeshi iikikaseteta

22:17.030 --> 22:25.330
Day after day I've told myself I have nothing to lose

22:27.000 --> 22:31.890
seijaku ni tadayou tsuki

22:27.000 --> 22:31.890
The moon drifts quietly

22:32.240 --> 22:37.250
donna yami mo terashiteyukeru

22:32.240 --> 22:37.250
Shining light on any breed of darkness

22:37.250 --> 22:42.590
tsuyoi hikari mirai e kazasu

22:37.250 --> 22:42.590
Extending its powerful light toward the future

22:42.590 --> 22:47.010
maketaku wa nai kara

22:42.590 --> 22:47.010
Not wanting to lose

22:48.170 --> 22:57.630
owaranai yume ga mune no zawameki ga karada wo megutte

22:48.170 --> 22:57.630
An endless dream... a stirring in my chest... runs through my body

22:58.710 --> 23:03.560
itami sae ima tsuyosa ni naru yo

22:58.710 --> 23:03.560
Even pain will become my strength

23:03.560 --> 23:08.380
shinjita michi wo yuku

23:03.560 --> 23:08.380
As I head down the path I believe in

23:09.220 --> 23:21.670
watashi wo tsukiugokasu netsu egakitsuzuketekita sekai e michibiku

23:09.220 --> 23:21.670
The fever that drives me forward... will lead me to the world I'd been imagining

23:33.390 --> 23:40.020
Kill   the   Fated

23:33.390 --> 23:40.020
Kill   the   Fated

23:33.390 --> 23:40.020
Kill   the   Fated
