<b>Mine and Sheele aren't up yet?</b>

03:32.440 --> 03:34.560
<b>Nope. But that's not unusual.</b>

03:40.450 --> 03:43.450
<b>Targets eliminated in the blink of an eye. 
You assassins don't play around.</b>

03:43.950 --> 03:47.160
<b>Tatsumi, we're making tuna over rice for lunch.</b>

03:47.160 --> 03:48.950
<b>You <i>really</i> don't play around.</b>

03:49.950 --> 03:52.500
<b>Huh? Where's my breakfast?</b>

03:55.500 --> 03:57.670
<b>Well done. Where are the others?</b>

03:58.250 --> 04:01.260
<b>I'm the only one who made it.</b>

04:01.260 --> 04:01.920
<b>I see.</b>

04:02.470 --> 04:07.140
<b>Here's a list of the people who've pledged their assistance when the revolt starts.</b>

04:07.140 --> 04:08.100
<b>I'll take good care of it.</b>

04:08.890 --> 04:10.180
<b>Leave the rest to me.</b>

04:11.270 --> 04:13.390
<b>Please... The revolution must...</b>

04:16.060 --> 04:18.360
<b>I'll make sure it succeeds.</b>

04:19.280 --> 04:23.070
<b>Our target for this mission is an 
infamous serial killer in the capital.</b>

04:23.700 --> 04:27.160
<b>He prowls the night, 
beheading any who cross his path.</b>

04:27.780 --> 04:30.200
<b>We don't know how many he's killed, 
but it numbers in the dozens.</b>

04:30.700 --> 04:33.330
<b>And a third of those were guards, right?</b>

04:33.330 --> 04:34.540
<b>He must be strong.</b>

04:34.540 --> 04:37.960
<b>It's gotta be Zank the Executioner.</b>

04:37.960 --> 04:39.460
<b>Huh? Who's that?</b>

04:39.460 --> 04:41.130
<b>You've never heard of him?</b>

04:41.130 --> 04:43.300
<b>You must have lived <i>way</i> out in the sticks.</b>

04:43.300 --> 04:46.470
<b>My apologies. I don't know who that is either.</b>

04:46.470 --> 04:49.720
<b>I think you just forgot, Sheele.</b>

04:50.220 --> 04:52.480
<b>So, what kind of villain is he?</b>

04:53.310 --> 04:54.850
<b>Zank the Executioner...</b>

04:55.770 --> 05:01.440
<b>They say he was once a headsman 
working at the largest prison in the capital.</b>

05:01.440 --> 05:05.030
<b>After gaining power, the prime minister 
sent more and more people to be executed.</b>

05:05.030 --> 05:09.120
<b>Day after day, time and time again,</b>

05:09.120 --> 05:12.950
<b>he would cut short their cries for mercy 
with a swift blade through the neck.</b>

05:12.950 --> 05:14.790
<b>After many years in this grisly trade,</b>

05:14.790 --> 05:18.130
<b>it would seem he developed a taste for beheading.</b>

05:18.790 --> 05:21.340
<b>I see why he went crazy.</b>

05:21.340 --> 05:25.510
<b>Anyway, he became unsatisfied with prison execution and started killing indiscriminately.</b>

05:25.510 --> 05:30.350
<b>They formed a squad to take him down, 
but he had already disappeared by then.</b>

05:30.350 --> 05:32.640
<b>And now he's shown his face again in the capital.</b>

05:33.180 --> 05:35.140
<b>Sounds like a dangerous guy.</b>

05:35.140 --> 05:36.520
<b>We need to find him and stop him!</b>

05:36.520 --> 05:38.150
<b>Hold on a sec, Tatsumi.</b>

05:38.150 --> 05:39.230
<b>Bro?</b>

05:39.650 --> 05:43.480
<b>Zank stole the warden's Imperial Relic 
before starting his killing spree.</b>

05:44.070 --> 05:46.700
<b>We should stick together,</b>

05:46.700 --> 05:48.450
<b>or you'll be in danger.</b>

05:48.450 --> 05:50.830
<b><i>Right now, I think I'm in danger 
for a completely different reason.</i></b>

05:50.830 --> 05:52.370
<b>Hey, Boss...</b>

05:52.370 --> 05:55.910
<b>Did we ever find out which Relic Zank has?</b>

05:55.910 --> 05:58.080
<b>We're still looking into it, unfortunately.</b>

05:58.080 --> 06:01.040
<b>I guess we won't find out so easily.</b>

06:01.040 --> 06:01.960
<b>That could be bad.</b>

06:01.960 --> 06:05.590
<b>Um, what are Imperial Relics, anyway?</b>

06:06.840 --> 06:07.930
<b>You're looking at one.</b>

06:07.930 --> 06:09.800
<b>I-I don't understand.</b>

06:09.800 --> 06:13.510
<b>Let's take this opportunity to explain it to Tatsumi, then.</b>

06:14.930 --> 06:16.430
<b>Around a thousand years ago,</b>

06:16.430 --> 06:19.480
<b>the founding emperor was deep in thought.</b>

06:20.150 --> 06:22.980
<b><i>I want to protect this empire forever,{i'm sure he means "smile"}</i></b>

06:22.980 --> 06:24.980
<b><i>but someday I will die.</i></b>

06:25.440 --> 06:30.490
<b><i>However, weapons and armor 
can be passed down into the future.</i></b>

06:31.160 --> 06:35.450
<b>To ensure this empire stands the test of time, 
we must create armaments imbued with wisdom!</b>

06:36.290 --> 06:39.460
<b>Materials were collected from legendary super-leveled Danger Beasts,</b>

06:40.580 --> 06:42.460
<b>as well as rare metals like orichalcum.</b>

06:43.170 --> 06:46.460
<b>The best smiths and craftsmen were summoned from around the world.</b>

06:47.340 --> 06:50.180
<b>With the power and assets available to him,</b>

06:50.180 --> 06:54.810
<b>the founding emperor produced forty-eight pieces of equipment that could not be reproduced today,</b>

06:54.810 --> 06:56.770
<b>which came to be known as the Imperial Relics.</b>

06:57.310 --> 06:59.640
<b>Each Relic possesses vast power,</b>

06:59.640 --> 07:02.770
<b>and some are said to rival the strength of a thousand men.</b>

07:03.560 --> 07:05.940
<b>The retainers who were granted these Relics</b>

07:05.940 --> 07:08.780
<b>were able to achieve even greater military gains.</b>

07:09.320 --> 07:12.530
<b>However, after the great civil war 
five hundred years ago,</b>

07:12.530 --> 07:16.330
<b>about half of the Relics were lost, dispersed throughout the land.</b>

07:17.830 --> 07:19.210
<b>And that's that.</b>

07:19.210 --> 07:20.000
<b>So that sword...</b>

07:20.790 --> 07:23.710
<b>is one of the forty-eight armaments?</b>

07:24.840 --> 07:27.630
<b>The One-Cut Killer, Murasame.</b>

07:27.630 --> 07:33.260
<b>Should this sword break a person's skin, 
it injects a deadly poison into the wound.</b>

07:33.260 --> 07:34.640
<b>There is no antidote.</b>

07:35.430 --> 07:37.890
<b>The Beast Ruler, Lionelle.</b>

07:37.890 --> 07:41.140
<b>A belt-shaped Relic that transforms the user into a beast,</b>

07:41.140 --> 07:44.060
<b>greatly increasing their physical abilities.</b>

07:44.060 --> 07:46.940
<b>It also enhances their senses, such as smell, 
allowing them to track enemies.</b>

07:47.650 --> 07:49.820
<b>The Spirit Artillery, Pumpkin.</b>

07:49.820 --> 07:53.820
<b>A gun-shaped Relic powered by the user's fighting spirit.</b>

07:53.820 --> 07:55.660
<b>The more danger the wielder is in,</b>

07:55.660 --> 07:57.540
<b>the more destructive its firepower.</b>

07:58.660 --> 08:01.250
<b>The Demonic Armor, Incursio.</b>

08:01.250 --> 08:04.630
<b>A Relic that provides impregnable defense.</b>

08:04.630 --> 08:06.710
<b>It puts the wearer under great stress,</b>

08:06.710 --> 08:09.460
<b>killing those it deems unworthy.</b>

08:10.170 --> 08:12.880
<b>The Wire of Many Uses, Cross Tail.</b>

08:12.880 --> 08:14.930
<b>A Relic formed of tough, durable filaments.</b>

08:14.930 --> 08:18.640
<b>It can be spread out to detect traps or enemies across a wide area,</b>

08:18.640 --> 08:20.770
<b>as well as binding and cutting up its victims.</b>

08:20.770 --> 08:22.770
<b>As the name suggests, it is a versatile Relic.</b>

08:23.850 --> 08:26.190
<b>The Absolute Bisector, Extase.</b>

08:26.190 --> 08:28.440
<b>A Relic shaped like a giant pair of scissors.</b>

08:28.440 --> 08:31.400
<b>It is capable of cutting through any known material</b>

08:31.400 --> 08:34.070
<b>and is sturdy enough to be used for defense.</b>

08:34.610 --> 08:37.780
<b>Some Relics also possess hidden abilities.</b>

08:37.780 --> 08:41.700
<b>For example, due to the material 
from which Incursio is constructed,</b>

08:41.700 --> 08:44.960
<b>its user is able to turn invisible for short periods of time.</b>

08:45.290 --> 08:49.170
<b>Considering the incredible power and 
hidden abilities of the Imperial Relics,</b>

08:49.170 --> 08:51.960
<b>there is one thing that has 
remained true throughout the ages:</b>

08:51.960 --> 08:55.380
<b>every time a Relic has been wielded with intent to kill,</b>

08:55.380 --> 08:58.600
<b>someone has wound up dead.</b>

08:59.510 --> 09:02.680
<b>Which means that if two Relic-wielders should fight one another,</b>

09:02.680 --> 09:04.890
<b>one is guaranteed to die.</b>

09:07.980 --> 09:10.190
<b>The target, Zank, is a Relic-wielder.</b>

09:10.190 --> 09:13.610
<b>Though you may well kill each other, you cannot both survive.</b>

09:13.990 --> 09:15.570
<b>Th-That's amazing.</b>

09:15.570 --> 09:16.660
<b>So...</b>

09:17.110 --> 09:20.080
<b>Now that you know all our secrets,</b>

09:20.580 --> 09:23.330
<b>we share a common destiny.</b>

09:23.330 --> 09:24.250
<b>R-Right.</b>

09:24.660 --> 09:26.500
<b>Don't be scared, Tatsumi.</b>

09:26.500 --> 09:29.130
<b>This just means the boss trusts you now.</b>

09:29.130 --> 09:32.380
<b>We of Night Raid may be few in number, 
but as you can see,</b>

09:32.380 --> 09:34.720
<b>our combat potential is vast.</b>

09:35.260 --> 09:37.130
<b>We are the ones who will 
bring about this revolution.</b>

09:37.470 --> 09:39.640
<b>B-Boss, what about me?</b>

09:39.640 --> 09:40.640
<b>Huh?</b>

09:40.640 --> 09:43.520
<b>You think you get an Imperial Relic too?</b>

09:43.520 --> 09:45.230
<b>Huh? I don't?</b>

09:46.850 --> 09:49.860
<b>If it's meant to be, you may obtain one someday.</b>

09:51.940 --> 09:53.400
<b>That's all I have to say.</b>

09:53.400 --> 09:55.900
<b>Go hunt down our prey 
whom the heavens cannot judge.</b>

09:56.570 --> 09:57.660
<b>Roger!</b>

10:03.330 --> 10:05.450
<b>We're in charge of this area.</b>

10:06.500 --> 10:09.540
<b>The citizens are so afraid of the killer 
that they're staying inside.</b>

10:09.830 --> 10:11.130
<b>Actually, that makes things easi—</b>

10:12.630 --> 10:14.630
<b>The Imperial Guard.</b>

10:15.590 --> 10:17.840
<b>Say, Akame... Can I ask you something?</b>

10:17.840 --> 10:19.260
<b>Don't worry.</b>

10:19.260 --> 10:21.050
<b>I've brought emergency rations.</b>

10:21.050 --> 10:22.560
<b>That isn't what I meant.</b>

10:23.220 --> 10:26.640
<b>Even the slightest scratch 
from that blade is fatal, right?</b>

10:26.640 --> 10:27.270
<b>That's right.</b>

10:29.400 --> 10:32.150
<b>I'm amazed I'm still alive.</b>

10:32.520 --> 10:35.320
<b>I've had this blade for some time now.</b>

10:35.320 --> 10:39.280
<b>It's become quite infamous as the "One-Cut Killer."</b>

10:39.280 --> 10:41.030
<b>Isn't it bad for you if people know that? {he says it's bad if her secret/exact form of her powers gets known. sort of like in F/SN}</b>

10:41.410 --> 10:43.990
<b>Not that there's any weaknesses they could use against you.</b>

10:43.990 --> 10:46.950
<b>Actually, this sword does have weaknesses.</b>

10:46.950 --> 10:47.620
<b>Like what?</b>

10:48.120 --> 10:49.960
<b>Maintaining it is nerve-racking.</b>

10:50.710 --> 10:52.590
<b>If you so much as nick your finger, you're dead.</b>

10:52.590 --> 10:53.840
<b>Right.</b>

10:53.840 --> 10:56.380
<b>And unless you actually cut your opponent's skin,</b>

10:56.380 --> 10:57.720
<b>the curse won't take effect.</b>

10:58.510 --> 11:02.140
<b>So someone totally covered in armor like Bro might pose a problem.</b>

11:02.850 --> 11:06.060
<b>In this world, one cut usually kills, poison or not.</b>

11:06.060 --> 11:08.480
<b>I try not to rely too heavily on the power of my Relic.</b>

11:09.480 --> 11:11.810
<b><i>She must be around my age.</i></b>

11:12.310 --> 11:16.530
<b><i>I wonder how much bloodshed Akame has endured until now.</i></b>

11:19.570 --> 11:23.530
<b>Looks like some assassins are here to join in the killing.</b>

11:24.240 --> 11:27.200
<b>What a violent city.</b>

11:27.200 --> 11:29.330
<b>Splendid. Simply splendid.</b>

11:29.330 --> 11:30.830
<b>Night Raid?</b>

11:31.460 --> 11:35.670
<b>I wonder whose head I'll take first.</b>

11:35.670 --> 11:39.170
<b>Oh, look at those eyes filled 
with passion and a sense of duty.</b>

11:39.170 --> 11:40.630
<b>Admirable. Absolutely admirable.</b>

11:40.630 --> 11:41.590
<b>That settles it!</b>

11:42.380 --> 11:45.430
<b>I'll have the most delicious one first.</b>

11:46.260 --> 11:49.350
<b>Seems he won't show himself so easily.</b>

11:49.350 --> 11:51.480
<b>I guess we'll just have to be patient.</b>

11:52.310 --> 11:53.650
<b>Excuse me for a minute.{splitting up with a killer around, always a good idea}</b>

11:54.270 --> 11:55.230
<b>Going to the bathroom?</b>

11:58.980 --> 12:00.860
<b>My nerves are killing me.</b>

12:06.370 --> 12:07.700
<b>Sayo...</b>

12:08.950 --> 12:10.370
<b>W-Wait!</b>

12:10.830 --> 12:12.370
<b>You're late, Tatsumi.</b>

12:23.130 --> 12:24.470
<b>No doubt about it.</b>

12:24.470 --> 12:25.220
<b>It's Sayo.</b>

12:25.800 --> 12:28.310
<b>What the heck? You were alive after all?{not saying a word = very unsuspicious}</b>

12:28.720 --> 12:30.560
<b>Well, I'm just glad to see you again.</b>

12:31.680 --> 12:33.140
<b>I could feel the love in the air.</b>

12:33.890 --> 12:37.150
<b>Looks like I showed you something rather special.</b>

12:38.190 --> 12:39.860
<b>Good evening.</b>

12:40.730 --> 12:42.400
<b>Sayo turned into an old weirdo!</b>

12:42.400 --> 12:45.360
<b>I have a name, you know.</b>

12:45.990 --> 12:47.280
<b>A friendly nickname, if you will:</b>

12:48.580 --> 12:50.450
<b>Zank the Executioner.</b>

12:51.120 --> 12:52.710
<b>You are...</b>

12:52.710 --> 12:54.250
<b>Zank the Executioner!{... no shit}</b>

12:56.250 --> 12:57.790
<b>Hmm...</b>

12:57.790 --> 13:00.340
<b>You could try to hold out until your partner turns up...</b>

13:00.340 --> 13:02.420
<b>but do you stand a chance against this foe?</b>

13:02.420 --> 13:03.720
<b>That's what you're thinking, isn't it?</b>

13:05.010 --> 13:07.220
<b><i>What? Did he read my mind?</i></b>

13:08.140 --> 13:10.010
<b><i>Is that eye an Imperial Relic?</i></b>

13:10.010 --> 13:13.560
<b>Bingo! Imperial Relic Spected.</b>

13:13.560 --> 13:16.480
<b>This is one of its five perception abilities: Insight.</b>

13:16.480 --> 13:21.030
<b>I can tell my opponent's thoughts 
just by looking at their expression.</b>

13:21.030 --> 13:24.240
<b>My observations are as sharp as sharp can be.</b>

13:25.030 --> 13:27.530
<b>Would you like a shrunken head from my collection?</b>

13:27.530 --> 13:30.580
<b>Like hell I would! But man, you sure talk a lot.</b>

13:31.080 --> 13:32.950
<b>Well, I do so love to chat.</b>

13:32.950 --> 13:36.370
<b>By the way, I found you with another of my powers: Farsight.</b>

13:37.120 --> 13:39.250
<b>Even in fog or the dark of night,</b>

13:39.250 --> 13:41.630
<b>I can see for miles around!</b>

13:42.710 --> 13:44.260
<b>This is splendid!</b>

13:44.760 --> 13:48.090
<b>Did you think you could catch me off guard while I was talking?</b>

13:48.090 --> 13:49.850
<b>Useless. Utterly useless!</b>

13:49.850 --> 13:52.310
<b>I can see every thought that crosses your mind.</b>

13:53.640 --> 13:56.480
<b>You'll take a big step forward, then swing from above...</b>

13:57.560 --> 13:59.310
<b>Then you'll slash upwards...</b>

14:00.270 --> 14:02.650
<b>but it's a feint designed to leave my throat open!</b>

14:04.740 --> 14:06.740
<b>That's what you were thinking, huh?</b>

14:11.450 --> 14:13.910
<b>He's far more powerful than anyone else I've fought.</b>

14:13.910 --> 14:19.000
<b>The expressions on their faces as I liberate their heads from their shoulders are just irresistible!</b>

14:19.830 --> 14:22.380
<b>The most common one is the blank stare.</b>

14:22.380 --> 14:24.170
<b>As if to say, "Huh?"</b>

14:24.170 --> 14:27.260
<b>I wonder what kind of expression you'll show me.</b>

14:27.260 --> 14:28.510
<b>Splendid. Simply splendid!</b>

14:28.930 --> 14:32.510
<b>You think my neck will yield to the likes of you?{this show}</b>

14:34.310 --> 14:35.600
<b>Tatsumi... {you don't have full moons two nights in a row, studio}</b>

14:38.730 --> 14:41.730
<b>Wonderful. You youngsters are so straightforward.</b>

14:41.730 --> 14:42.980
<b>I'm liking you even more.</b>

14:42.980 --> 14:46.150
<b>You'll make a fine addition to my collection!</b>

14:48.400 --> 14:50.110
<b>Splendid. Simply splendid.</b>

14:51.030 --> 14:54.280
<b>A magnificent wound I've inflicted upon you, if I do say so myself.{cr has 1 good line an episode and this is that line}</b>

14:54.280 --> 14:55.740
<b>What?</b>

14:55.740 --> 15:00.290
<b>I find it most gratifying to see people with 
wonderful eyes like yours beg for their lives.</b>

15:00.290 --> 15:02.960
<b>So I think I'll take my time.</b>

15:03.590 --> 15:06.170
<b>Now, beg.</b>

15:06.170 --> 15:09.760
<b>If you do, maybe you can buy some time for your friends to arrive.</b>

15:13.550 --> 15:14.930
<b>Don't be ridiculous.</b>

15:14.930 --> 15:19.520
<b>I would never beg for my life from a dirty rat like you</b>

15:19.520 --> 15:21.900
<b>who only knows how to behead people!</b>

15:23.560 --> 15:27.030
<b><i>He can read my mind, 
so I might as well keep this simple.</i></b>

15:27.730 --> 15:29.650
<b><i>I'm putting everything on the line...</i></b>

15:29.650 --> 15:31.570
<b><i>with this one strike!</i></b>

15:32.070 --> 15:34.450
<b>Well, that's very valiant of you.</b>

15:34.780 --> 15:37.040
<b>I'm sure your wounds must hurt.</b>

15:37.040 --> 15:40.120
<b>Sounds like you need the help of a master executioner.</b>

15:40.500 --> 15:41.500
<b>Here I come!</b>

15:47.000 --> 15:49.920
<b><i>His attack was much faster than I anticipated.</i></b>

15:49.920 --> 15:51.180
<b><i>He's...</i></b>

15:52.090 --> 15:53.930
<b>I got a strike in.</b>

15:55.010 --> 15:57.680
<b>Master executioner, my ass.</b>

15:58.180 --> 16:00.310
<b>You totally missed my neck.</b>

16:00.310 --> 16:02.350
<b>Don't make me laugh, you amateur.</b>

16:02.350 --> 16:03.190
<b>Silence!</b>

16:15.070 --> 16:16.530
<b>Nice psychological warfare.</b>

16:16.990 --> 16:19.080
<b>Mentally, you won that fight.</b>

16:19.080 --> 16:20.080
<b>Akame!</b>

16:20.330 --> 16:22.080
<b>I've finally found you.</b>

16:22.080 --> 16:23.120
<b>Just wait.</b>

16:23.540 --> 16:25.460
<b>I'll end this quickly and tend to your wounds.</b>

16:28.420 --> 16:32.380
<b>The infamous Akame and her enchanted sword, Murasame.</b>

16:32.380 --> 16:33.970
<b>Splendid. Simply splendid.</b>

16:33.970 --> 16:35.300
<b>I've always wanted to meet you.</b>

16:35.300 --> 16:38.560
<b>Likewise. It's my mission to eliminate you, after all.</b>

16:39.260 --> 16:40.060
<b>Clearsight!</b>

16:41.350 --> 16:44.350
<b>No hidden weapons, I see.</b>

16:45.230 --> 16:46.610
<b>Be careful, Akame!</b>

16:46.610 --> 16:48.860
<b>He can use that eye to read your mind!</b>

16:48.860 --> 16:49.980
<b>I see.</b>

16:49.980 --> 16:52.190
<b>So that's the power of that Imperial Relic.</b>

16:52.860 --> 16:56.530
<b>But if you can't counter 
the attacks you read, your power...</b>

16:56.530 --> 16:57.820
<b>is useless!</b>

17:01.910 --> 17:04.500
<b><i>He's no rookie. He must have seen quite a few battles.</i></b>

17:04.870 --> 17:07.460
<b><i>She has the arm strength to go with her speed, I see.</i></b>

17:10.340 --> 17:12.300
<b><i>Th-That was fast!</i></b>

17:12.300 --> 17:15.680
<b><i>So this is a fight between Relic-wielders?</i></b>

17:16.510 --> 17:18.890
<b><i>With him reading my mind, we're at an impasse.</i></b>

17:19.470 --> 17:20.260
<b><i>So...</i></b>

17:22.600 --> 17:25.890
<b><i>Oh? You've cleared your mind. Impressive.</i></b>

17:26.230 --> 17:29.310
<b><i>But my Spected can still see the future.</i></b>

17:29.310 --> 17:32.690
<b><i>Judging by your muscle movements, 
your next move will be—</i></b>

17:34.950 --> 17:35.740
<b><i>I see it!</i></b>

17:44.620 --> 17:46.830
<b><i>He even landed a hit on Akame.</i></b>

17:46.830 --> 17:48.290
<b>Good grief.</b>

17:48.290 --> 17:53.050
<b>Using a sword that kills with the slightest scratch is a bit unfair, don't you think?</b>

17:53.050 --> 17:55.800
<b>You can read my thoughts and predict my moves,</b>

17:56.220 --> 17:57.550
<b>so I think we're even.</b>

17:57.550 --> 17:58.840
<b>Say, Akame...</b>

17:59.340 --> 18:01.100
<b>How do you deal with the voices?</b>

18:02.220 --> 18:02.850
<b>The voices?</b>

18:04.180 --> 18:07.940
<b>You know, the ones you hear when it's quiet.</b>

18:07.940 --> 18:11.820
<b>The voices of everyone you've killed, 
moaning from the depths of Hell.</b>

18:11.820 --> 18:13.530
<b>They still hate me.</b>

18:13.530 --> 18:16.650
<b>Every day, they tell me to hurry up and join them.</b>

18:17.450 --> 18:20.780
<b>I started hearing them back when I was 
lopping off heads every day at the prison.</b>

18:20.780 --> 18:22.830
<b>But it's gotten a whole lot worse lately.</b>

18:22.830 --> 18:26.660
<b>I cover them up by talking a lot, but how do you—</b>

18:26.660 --> 18:28.250
<b>I don't hear them.</b>

18:28.580 --> 18:31.630
<b>I've never heard any voices like that.</b>

18:31.630 --> 18:33.000
<b>How surprising.</b>

18:33.000 --> 18:37.380
<b>And here I thought an assassin of 
your caliber would understand my pain.</b>

18:38.930 --> 18:41.090
<b>How depressing!</b>

18:50.560 --> 18:51.560
<b>Kurome...</b>

18:52.520 --> 18:54.400
<b>Wh-What's wrong?</b>

18:54.400 --> 18:56.070
<b>Akame! Akame!</b>

18:56.070 --> 18:57.650
<b>Illusight.</b>

18:57.650 --> 19:02.280
<b>I made the person she values most appear right before her eyes.</b>

19:02.990 --> 19:08.290
<b>Right now, she's lost in her memories, 
reunited with the one most precious to her.</b>

19:09.080 --> 19:11.460
<b>So that's why I saw Sayo before.</b>

19:11.460 --> 19:12.250
<b>Akame!</b>

19:12.580 --> 19:14.210
<b>It's an illusion!</b>

19:14.210 --> 19:15.670
<b>Don't be fooled!</b>

19:15.670 --> 19:17.010
<b>It's no use.</b>

19:17.010 --> 19:20.430
<b>It only works on one person at a time, but my hold on them is unbreakable.</b>

19:20.430 --> 19:23.680
<b>And no matter how experienced they might be,</b>

19:23.680 --> 19:26.850
<b>it is impossible for someone to kill those they hold dear!</b>

19:27.560 --> 19:31.520
<b>Gaze upon the face of your beloved, and die, Akame!</b>

19:37.320 --> 19:38.400
<b><i>She...</i></b>

19:41.860 --> 19:43.450
<b><i>She didn't even falter.</i></b>

19:45.030 --> 19:46.240
<b>Why?!</b>

19:46.240 --> 19:48.660
<b>You should have seen the one you loved most!</b>

19:49.250 --> 19:51.080
<b>It's <i>because</i> I loved her</b>

19:51.540 --> 19:53.540
<b>that I killed her as swiftly as possible.</b>

19:54.840 --> 19:56.710
<b><i>What did she...</i></b>

19:57.170 --> 19:59.590
<b>The battle is decided.</b>

20:00.670 --> 20:02.260
<b><i>No! It's going to break!</i></b>

20:02.590 --> 20:04.180
<b>First, I'll destroy your weapon!</b>

20:05.550 --> 20:07.140
<b>I won't die!</b>

20:09.560 --> 20:10.520
<b><i>I'll kill you first!</i></b>

20:10.980 --> 20:13.520
<b><i>Reading your moves gives me the advantage!</i></b>

20:13.520 --> 20:14.810
<b><i>You can't hit me!</i></b>

20:14.810 --> 20:17.570
<b><i>The moment before you strike, I'll—</i></b>

20:25.620 --> 20:26.580
<b>Eliminate.</b>

20:34.960 --> 20:35.880
<b>We did it!</b>

20:37.670 --> 20:39.590
<b><i>I'd be dead without her, though.</i></b>

20:40.130 --> 20:42.340
<b><i>I need to get stronger.</i></b>

20:43.930 --> 20:48.180
<b>Zank. The voices won't bother you anymore.</b>

20:52.730 --> 20:53.890
<b>They've...</b>

20:55.270 --> 20:56.400
<b>finally stopped.</b>

20:58.980 --> 21:02.400
<b>S-Splendid... Simply splendid.</b>

21:02.940 --> 21:04.110
<b>Thank you,</b>

21:05.110 --> 21:06.360
<b>Akame... {ok, I guess they can leave the teigu. oh wait, just saw the preview}</b>

21:15.330 --> 21:16.250
<b>Sayo...</b>

21:17.250 --> 21:18.840
<b>What are you doing?</b>

21:18.840 --> 21:20.380
<b>It's time to prepare dinner.</b>

21:20.880 --> 21:22.760
<b>You can still do that, 
even when you're injured.</b>

21:23.170 --> 21:27.760
<b>Say, Akame, who did you see back there?</b>

21:31.180 --> 21:33.100
<b>When the time comes, I'll tell you.</b>

21:34.180 --> 21:36.060
<b>However, I can say this much.</b>

21:36.060 --> 21:40.320
<b>Right now, everyone in Night Raid is precious to me.</b>

21:41.730 --> 21:43.030
<b>Including you.</b>

21:43.030 --> 21:44.070
<b>What?</b>

21:44.530 --> 21:45.820
<b>Let's go.</b>

21:45.820 --> 21:47.780
<b>Hey, wait!</b>

21:47.780 --> 21:49.490
<b>We're having lots of meat tonight.</b>

21:49.490 --> 21:51.410
<b>We just had meat yesterday!</b>

21:51.410 --> 21:52.660
<b>What happened to a balanced diet?</b>

21:52.660 --> 21:54.160
<b>We need to eat vegetables too!</b>

21:54.160 --> 21:56.160
