<b>Now, shall we go?</b>

18:25.450 --> 18:27.540
<b>We have a lot of work to do.</b>

18:38.510 --> 18:40.340
<b>This is more than we've ever received before!</b>

18:40.720 --> 18:45.810
<b>Thanks to our three heroes, 
no one else will have to starve.</b>

18:45.810 --> 18:47.850
<b>Now that the empire's been overthrown,</b>

18:47.850 --> 18:50.980
<b>maybe Tatsumi, Sayo, 
and Ieyasu will be coming back.{;_;}</b>

18:51.270 --> 18:52.310
<b>Yeah.</b>

18:52.310 --> 18:54.730
<b>Our heroes are returning home.</b>

18:54.730 --> 18:57.990
<b>We'll greet them with one heck of a party!</b>

19:26.970 --> 19:28.890
<b>People really are strong, aren't they?</b>

19:29.430 --> 19:31.400
<b>The city's already coming back together.</b>

19:31.400 --> 19:32.600
<b>Boss...</b>

19:32.600 --> 19:34.480
<b>Are you all right?</b>

19:34.480 --> 19:35.400
<b>Yeah.</b>

19:35.940 --> 19:39.150
<b>My lifespan's been shortened, but that's it.</b>

19:39.150 --> 19:41.410
<b>And while I don't know how long I'll live...</b>

19:44.450 --> 19:48.660
<b>I'll gladly use the rest of my life to help 
build the foundation of our new nation.</b>

19:48.660 --> 19:52.540
<b>That's the best I can do as a survivor.</b>

19:53.170 --> 19:54.790
<b>I believe in you, Boss.</b>

19:54.790 --> 19:56.040
<b>Work hard.</b>

20:00.880 --> 20:04.090
<b>Are you going away, Akame?</b>

20:04.090 --> 20:05.390
<b>Yeah.</b>

20:05.390 --> 20:10.310
<b>You can pin all the Revolutionary Army's 
wrongdoings on me.</b>

20:10.310 --> 20:11.560
<b>Thanks, and I'm sorry.</b>

20:11.560 --> 20:13.150
<b>That's a difficult role.</b>

20:13.150 --> 20:17.270
<b>Your role in helping build the new nation 
is far more difficult.</b>

20:17.690 --> 20:20.070
<b>I've been through a lot since then,</b>

20:20.070 --> 20:24.320
<b>but I'm glad you asked me to join Night Raid,</b>

20:24.990 --> 20:26.410
<b>Najenda.</b>

20:26.410 --> 20:27.370
<b>Yeah.</b>

20:28.580 --> 20:30.160
<b>It's been fun.</b>

20:35.580 --> 20:36.670
<b>Farewell.</b>

20:39.380 --> 20:41.420
<b><i>Survive, Akame.</i></b>

20:48.140 --> 20:49.510
<b><i>Night Raid.</i></b>

20:50.430 --> 20:52.600
<b><i>By the end of the Imperial Era,</i></b>

20:52.600 --> 20:56.650
<b><i>they were known as a criminal organization 
responsible for causing unrest in the capital.</i></b>

20:57.520 --> 21:04.150
<b><i>However, no trace of them remains 
in the new nation's historical records.</i></b>

21:06.110 --> 21:09.660
<b><i>Where there is life, there is darkness.</i></b>

21:10.660 --> 21:13.660
<b><i>Where there is darkness, there is evil.</i></b>

21:14.290 --> 21:19.210
<b><i>For the sake of those who cannot fight, 
we judge the evildoers that heaven cannot</i></b>

21:19.210 --> 21:21.380
<b><i>and punish them in the shadows.</i></b>

21:22.550 --> 21:25.510
<b><i>We are the assassins.</i></b>

21:26.970 --> 21:27.010
<b>{first frame of ED}</b>

21:38.610 --> 21:41.860
furikaeru kako wa nai

21:38.610 --> 21:41.860
I've had no past to look back on

21:43.850 --> 21:47.240
kono te hanashita hi kara

21:43.850 --> 21:47.240
Ever since the day I pulled my hand away

21:49.000 --> 21:57.300
ushinau mono wa nai to kurikaeshi iikikaseteta

21:49.000 --> 21:57.300
Day after day I've told myself I have nothing to lose

21:58.970 --> 22:03.860
seijaku ni tadayou tsuki

21:58.970 --> 22:03.860
The moon drifts quietly

22:04.210 --> 22:09.220
donna yami mo terashiteyukeru

22:04.210 --> 22:09.220
Shining light on any breed of darkness

22:09.220 --> 22:14.560
tsuyoi hikari mirai e kazasu

22:09.220 --> 22:14.560
Extending its powerful light toward the future

22:14.560 --> 22:18.980
maketaku wa nai kara

22:14.560 --> 22:18.980
Not wanting to lose

22:20.140 --> 22:29.600
owaranai yume ga mune no zawameki ga karada wo megutte

22:20.140 --> 22:29.600
An endless dream... a stirring in my chest... runs through my body

22:30.680 --> 22:35.530
itami sae ima tsuyosa ni naru yo

22:30.680 --> 22:35.530
Even pain will become my strength

22:35.530 --> 22:40.350
shinjita michi wo yuku

22:35.530 --> 22:40.350
As I head down the path I believe in

22:41.190 --> 22:53.640
watashi wo tsukiugokasu netsu egakitsuzuketekita sekai e michibiku

22:41.190 --> 22:53.640
The fever that drives me forward... will lead me to the world I'd been imagining

23:03.610 --> 23:06.360
<b><i>I survived.</i></b>

23:06.360 --> 23:11.780
<b><i>And so, I must continue to carry the feelings of those who have passed on my shoulders.</i></b>

23:16.700 --> 23:19.040
<b><i>I can only kill. {herein lies the issue with kiru = kill. }{but all you need is kill}{let's just change the title}</i></b>

23:20.000 --> 23:23.750
<b><i>However, this sword can also 
cut open a path to the future.{because kirihiraku}</i></b>

23:25.210 --> 23:26.460
<b><i>I know it can. {therefore Akame ga Kiru! actually means Akame will open the future}</i></b>

23:27.130 --> 23:28.880
<b><i>That's why...</i></b>

23:28.880 --> 23:30.970
<b><i>I will continue to walk this path.</i></b>

23:34.720 --> 23:35.640
<b>Eliminate!</b>
