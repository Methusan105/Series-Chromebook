00:01.430 --> 00:02.890
<b>General Esdeath,</b>

00:02.890 --> 00:05.310
<b>your victory over the northern race was outstanding.</b>

00:05.310 --> 00:08.230
<b>We have prepared ten thousand gold pieces as your reward.</b>

00:08.690 --> 00:10.480
<b>Thank you.</b>

00:10.480 --> 00:13.950
<b>I shall send them to the soldiers I left in the North.</b>

00:13.950 --> 00:14.950
<b>They will rejoice.</b>

00:15.200 --> 00:19.080
<b><i>Esdeath has no interest in authority or politics whatsoever.</i></b>

00:19.080 --> 00:22.290
<b><i>She lives only to fight and conquer the enemy.</i></b>

00:22.540 --> 00:27.590
<b><i>Thus, I can leave her to do as she pleases 
while I rule the empire from the shadows.</i></b>

00:27.590 --> 00:29.300
<b><i>Everyone wins.</i></b>

00:29.300 --> 00:31.510
<b><i>What a perfect hand to be dealt.</i></b>

00:31.970 --> 00:34.220
<b>Now that I have returned to the capital,</b>

00:34.220 --> 00:37.260
<b>my next task will be to locate Night Raid, the thorn in Your Majesty's side,</b>

00:37.260 --> 00:39.180
<b>and eliminate them without delay.</b>

00:39.510 --> 00:41.270
<b>A formidable endeavor.</b>

00:41.270 --> 00:44.850
<b>Should you succeed, mere gold 
would not be enough to repay you.</b>

00:45.230 --> 00:47.270
<b>Is there anything else you desire?</b>

00:47.270 --> 00:48.940
<b>Let me see.</b>

00:48.940 --> 00:50.480
<b>If I may...</b>

00:50.480 --> 00:51.610
<b>Yes?</b>

00:51.820 --> 00:53.950
<b>I was thinking I'd like to fall in love.</b>

00:57.730 --> 00:59.160
<b>Is that so?</b>

00:59.160 --> 01:02.330
<b>Indeed, you are of age and still unmarried.</b>

01:02.330 --> 01:04.560
<b>Then allow me to offer some options.</b>

01:04.560 --> 01:06.470
<b>What do you think of the prime minister?</b>

01:06.470 --> 01:07.380
<b>Majesty!</b>

01:07.380 --> 01:08.650
<b>As much I appreciate it,</b>

01:08.650 --> 01:12.010
<b>with the prime minister's high blood pressure, he may not live to see tomorrow.</b>

01:12.010 --> 01:12.920
<b>How rude!</b>

01:12.920 --> 01:14.590
<b>I am in perfect health.</b>

01:15.430 --> 01:18.550
<b>But very well. What type would interest you, General?</b>

01:18.550 --> 01:22.020
<b>I have very specific standards.</b>

01:22.020 --> 01:25.270
<b>There are likely not many who fit my criteria.</b>

01:25.270 --> 01:29.650
<b>I shall note down my preferences 
and present them to you in due course.</b>

03:01.950 --> 03:05.450
Kill   the   Three

03:01.950 --> 03:05.450
Kill   the   Three

03:01.950 --> 03:05.450
—   Part   One   —

03:01.950 --> 03:05.450
—   Part   One   —

03:01.950 --> 03:05.450
—   Part   One   —

03:01.950 --> 03:05.450
—   Part   One   —

03:11.960 --> 03:12.670
<b>Mine...</b>

03:12.670 --> 03:14.170
<b>I can eat on my own.</b>

03:14.630 --> 03:15.800
<b>It'll get cold.</b>

03:20.300 --> 03:21.590
<b>Fine.</b>

03:26.140 --> 03:28.520
<b><i>Even after Sheele's death,</i></b>

03:28.520 --> 03:30.350
<b><i>Akame is as calm as always.</i></b>

03:31.190 --> 03:32.770
<b><i>And worse, the one who took her life</i></b>

03:33.400 --> 03:35.150
<b><i>was that girl.</i></b>

03:36.570 --> 03:41.570
<b><i>I'm starting to truly understand 
how painful this line of work can be.</i></b>

03:43.320 --> 03:48.620
<b>Indeed, it is strange that I would find interest 
in something other than conflict and slaughter.</b>

03:49.250 --> 03:51.540
<b>Ah, is this about love?</b>

03:51.790 --> 03:54.380
<b>Even I am perplexed.</b>

03:54.380 --> 03:56.290
<b>However, I cannot do anything about my own feelings.</b>

03:56.540 --> 04:01.260
<b>As a living being, it's natural to be interested in the opposite sex.</b>

04:01.420 --> 04:04.720
<b><i>Though the word "love" doesn't suit you at all.{goddamn sally-chan-sensei}</i></b>

04:04.970 --> 04:06.220
<b>I understand.</b>

04:06.220 --> 04:08.890
<b>Then this too is an animal instinct, I suppose.</b>

04:08.890 --> 04:12.730
<b>Well, for now, I'll simply take 
my pleasure in hunting Night Raid.</b>

04:13.020 --> 04:14.310
<b>About that...</b>

04:14.310 --> 04:17.020
<b>I have quite a good idea.</b>

04:21.280 --> 04:24.070
<b>I have a new directive for the three of you.</b>

04:24.070 --> 04:27.200
<b>As you command, Lady Esdeath.</b>

04:27.200 --> 04:30.950
<b>We three are your loyal servants.</b>

04:30.950 --> 04:34.460
<b>We'll accept any order at any time!</b>

04:34.750 --> 04:36.210
<b>Very well.</b>

04:38.750 --> 04:40.460
<b>Jeez, it's cold.</b>

04:40.460 --> 04:42.090
<b>I can't sleep at all.</b>

04:42.510 --> 04:44.510
<b>Maybe some water will help.</b>

04:45.130 --> 04:46.300
<b>Akame?</b>

04:47.300 --> 04:48.720
<b>A midnight snack?</b>

04:48.970 --> 04:50.180
<b>No.</b>

04:50.180 --> 04:51.890
<b>This was one of Sheele's favorites.</b>

04:52.230 --> 04:53.770
<b><i>So it's an offering for the departed.</i></b>

04:54.140 --> 04:56.650
<b>Since we work from the shadows,</b>

04:56.650 --> 05:00.110
<b>Sheele's name will probably never appear in the Revolutionary Army's records.</b>

05:00.480 --> 05:04.490
<b>That's why I will remember as much as I can about her.</b>

05:05.280 --> 05:06.990
<b>She may have been clumsy,</b>

05:07.490 --> 05:10.490
<b>but she was the kindest of all of us.</b>

05:11.910 --> 05:13.120
<b>I know.</b>

05:13.120 --> 05:16.920
<b>She used to bring flowers to Sayo and Ieyasu's graves.</b>

05:16.920 --> 05:17.540
<b>Yeah.</b>

05:17.540 --> 05:18.840
<b>But...</b>

05:18.840 --> 05:21.210
<b>You're amazing, Akame.</b>

05:21.630 --> 05:24.170
<b>You're so composed, 
even after losing a friend.</b>

05:24.170 --> 05:25.880
<b>I guess you're used to it.</b>

05:25.880 --> 05:26.930
<b>I can't even—</b>

05:28.640 --> 05:29.930
<b>Composed?</b>

05:30.640 --> 05:31.850
<b>Used to it?</b>

05:31.850 --> 05:32.520
<b>Akame?</b>

05:39.150 --> 05:40.400
<b>It's true.</b>

05:40.400 --> 05:43.400
<b>I've seen many lives fall before me.</b>

05:43.400 --> 05:44.030
<b>However...</b>

05:44.610 --> 05:46.780
<b>I had a close friend taken from me!</b>

05:46.780 --> 05:49.320
<b>How could anyone get used to this pain?</b>

05:50.950 --> 05:54.540
<b>But I can't let my emotions interfere with the mission.</b>

05:54.540 --> 05:57.330
<b>That's why I act like I'm fine!</b>

05:58.580 --> 06:00.460
<b>We work in the shadows.</b>

06:00.460 --> 06:02.750
<b>If I couldn't switch gears, what good would I be?</b>

06:03.250 --> 06:06.760
<b>And this... This is "composed" to you?</b>

06:08.010 --> 06:10.140
<b>E-Even I...</b>

06:10.140 --> 06:12.640
<b>Ever since Sheele died, I...</b>

06:12.930 --> 06:14.140
<b>I...</b>

06:16.270 --> 06:19.270
<b><i>I've never seen Akame so shaken.</i></b>

06:20.480 --> 06:22.270
<b><i>Though, come to think of it...</i></b>

06:22.270 --> 06:25.360
<b><i>She also worried about me on my first mission, didn't she?</i></b>

06:25.690 --> 06:27.400
<b><i>What the hell am I doing?</i></b>

06:27.400 --> 06:29.240
<b><i>I have to keep it together!</i></b>

06:29.240 --> 06:33.330
<b><i>Being miserable won't bring Sheele back!</i></b>

06:33.330 --> 06:35.370
<b><i>I have to face forward like a man!</i></b>

06:40.290 --> 06:43.790
<b><i>Besides, this may be dirty work, but money is money.</i></b>

06:43.790 --> 06:46.760
<b><i>At least I'll be able to provide for my village until the revolution.</i></b>

06:47.260 --> 06:51.260
<b><i>I have people I want to make happy.</i></b>

06:52.180 --> 06:53.510
<b>Wh-What was that?</b>

06:53.510 --> 06:54.760
<b>Are you all right, Tatsumi?</b>

06:55.060 --> 06:57.310
<b>That was my way of switching gears.</b>

06:57.310 --> 06:58.940
<b>Don't worry about me.</b>

06:58.940 --> 07:01.100
<b>Anyway, I'm sorry, Akame.</b>

07:01.100 --> 07:02.730
<b>That was thoughtless of me.</b>

07:03.900 --> 07:05.480
<b>Let me promise you again:</b>

07:05.820 --> 07:07.360
<b>I will not die!</b>

07:07.360 --> 07:09.360
<b>I vow never to make you grieve!</b>

07:10.400 --> 07:11.530
<b>Tatsumi...</b>

07:12.820 --> 07:15.830
<b>We'll usher in a new nation 
with smiles on everyone's faces.</b>

07:17.080 --> 07:19.580
<b>Yeah. You're right.</b>

07:34.390 --> 07:35.300
<b>Damn it!</b>

07:40.980 --> 07:43.150
<b>O-One more time, Akame!</b>

07:43.150 --> 07:45.820
<b>Maybe you should rest a bit.</b>

07:45.820 --> 07:47.690
<b>How can I rest at a time like this?</b>

07:47.900 --> 07:48.860
<b>Didn't I tell you?</b>

07:48.860 --> 07:51.240
<b>Treat this like a real battle, and fight me!</b>

07:51.240 --> 07:52.150
<b>Here I come!</b>

07:57.490 --> 07:59.120
<b>What are you doing, Bro?</b>

07:59.120 --> 08:02.870
<b>In a real battle, you must always be mindful of your surroundings.</b>

08:02.870 --> 08:05.750
<b>You never know where an enemy might be hiding.</b>

08:08.000 --> 08:10.130
<b>You seem unusually pumped up today.</b>

08:10.550 --> 08:11.720
<b>What's the deal?</b>

08:11.720 --> 08:12.720
<b>It's nothing.</b>

08:12.720 --> 08:15.090
<b>I just want to get stronger.</b>

08:15.550 --> 08:17.390
<b>I made a promise to Akame.</b>

08:17.390 --> 08:19.310
<b>I promised I'd survive, no matter what!</b>

08:21.770 --> 08:22.640
<b>Tatsumi...</b>

08:22.810 --> 08:25.190
<b>You've learned quite a lot, haven't you?</b>

08:25.190 --> 08:26.270
<b>You've really grown.</b>

08:26.560 --> 08:27.570
<b>All right, then!</b>

08:27.570 --> 08:29.400
<b>Allow me to be your opponent.</b>

08:29.400 --> 08:30.900
<b>I'll train the hell out of you!</b>

08:31.190 --> 08:32.240
<b>Bro!</b>

08:32.240 --> 08:34.280
<b>No one beats my polemanship!</b>

08:37.160 --> 08:38.410
<b>What's wrong, Tatsumi?</b>

08:40.410 --> 08:42.370
<b>Being pumped won't keep you alive!</b>

08:43.080 --> 08:43.870
<b>Right!</b>

08:43.870 --> 08:45.250
<b>Now, come at me!</b>

08:47.000 --> 08:48.040
<b><i>Good luck.</i></b>

08:50.840 --> 08:53.010
<b>It seems this village is suffering too.</b>

08:53.300 --> 08:55.970
<b>Is a nation's foremost duty not to its people?</b>

08:55.970 --> 08:57.600
<b>And it's out of concern for these people</b>

08:58.010 --> 09:00.970
<b>that you are returning to 
that snake's nest of a capital.</b>

09:00.970 --> 09:02.220
<b>I'm proud of you, Father.</b>

09:02.220 --> 09:05.940
<b>I can't stay in retirement 
while the people suffer like this.</b>

09:05.940 --> 09:09.110
<b>I intend to fight the prime minister to the very end.</b>

09:09.110 --> 09:11.230
<b>And I will protect you, Father!</b>

09:11.730 --> 09:14.150
<b>You've become a fine woman.</b>

09:14.150 --> 09:16.360
<b>Though I wonder if you've grown too headstrong to find a suitor.</b>

09:16.360 --> 09:19.240
<b>Th-That has nothing to do with anything!</b>

09:21.870 --> 09:22.910
<b>Wh-What was that?</b>

09:25.160 --> 09:26.620
<b>More bandits?</b>

09:26.620 --> 09:28.750
<b>Just how far has public order crumbled?</b>

09:29.090 --> 09:31.170
<b>I'll handle them as I did the others!</b>

09:31.630 --> 09:32.670
<b>Keep your guard up!</b>

09:34.760 --> 09:35.630
<b>Daidara?{daidaraaaaa}</b>

09:35.630 --> 09:36.510
<b>Yeah.</b>

09:37.220 --> 09:38.220
<b>Here we go!</b>

09:49.860 --> 09:51.020
<b><i>He's way too strong!</i></b>

09:51.820 --> 09:53.900
<b>Not bad, lady.</b>

09:53.900 --> 09:57.530
<b>But when you find out what I've got in store for you,</b>

09:57.530 --> 10:00.120
<b>you'll probably wish you were dead.</b>

10:04.330 --> 10:07.330
<b>Y-You're soldiers from the capital.</b>

10:07.540 --> 10:08.290
<b>Indeed.</b>

10:08.290 --> 10:11.380
<b>And let me say that I deeply admire your political accomplishments.</b>

10:11.380 --> 10:13.420
<b>Th-Then why do you assail me?</b>

10:14.210 --> 10:16.130
<b>Because, in the end...</b>

10:21.100 --> 10:24.310
<b>our master's orders are absolute.</b>

10:25.720 --> 10:28.100
<b>We took out fifteen people, eh?</b>

10:28.100 --> 10:32.190
<b>All right! The more experience I gain, 
the stronger I'll become!</b>

10:32.190 --> 10:33.480
<b>Spread the flyers.</b>

10:34.440 --> 10:37.280
<b>Couldn't the prime minister have taken a more direct approach?</b>

10:37.280 --> 10:40.360
<b>Why not just frame his 
political opponents like usual?</b>

10:40.360 --> 10:44.620
<b>That approach won't work for civil officials 
under Commander-in-Chief Budo's protection.</b>

10:44.620 --> 10:46.450
<b>Man, that was fun!</b>

10:46.450 --> 10:48.620
<b>Nyau, stop playing around.</b>

10:48.620 --> 10:51.040
<b>I hope you put her out of her misery.</b>

10:52.290 --> 10:55.550
<b>Don't worry. She died from shock while I was still skinning her.</b>

10:55.550 --> 10:58.300
<b>Your methods are as grisly as ever, I see.</b>

10:58.300 --> 10:59.840
<b>Mission complete.</b>

10:59.840 --> 11:01.050
<b>Let us return.</b>

11:06.560 --> 11:10.940
Punishment from Heaven by Night Raid

11:11.690 --> 11:13.440
<b>Thank you all for coming.</b>

11:13.440 --> 11:14.440
<b>I have some bad news.</b>

11:15.020 --> 11:18.440
<b>Esdeath has conquered the North and returned to the capital.</b>

11:21.570 --> 11:22.490
<b>Leone,</b>

11:22.490 --> 11:25.700
<b>travel to the capital and observe her actions.</b>

11:25.700 --> 11:26.790
<b>Roger!</b>

11:26.790 --> 11:29.080
<b>I've always wanted to see what kind of person she is.</b>

11:30.960 --> 11:33.710
<b>She's a dangerous sadist with a taste for carnage.</b>

11:33.710 --> 11:34.590
<b>Be on your guard.</b>

11:34.590 --> 11:36.170
<b>All right, all right.</b>

11:37.710 --> 11:38.840
<b><i>Which means...</i></b>

11:38.840 --> 11:41.630
<b><i>She's someone I can knock off 
if I get the chance, huh?</i></b>

11:41.630 --> 11:44.600
<b><i>That raging sadist of a general 
is renowned as the capital's strongest.</i></b>

11:44.600 --> 11:46.890
<b><i>Killing her would be as good as 
bringing down the prime minister.</i></b>

11:48.020 --> 11:48.720
<b>Furthermore,</b>

11:49.310 --> 11:52.140
<b>ever since Esdeath reappeared,</b>

11:52.140 --> 11:55.270
<b>political officials have been turning up dead.</b>

11:56.190 --> 12:00.780
<b>So far, the count stands at 
four officials and sixty-one guards.</b>

12:00.780 --> 12:05.700
<b>The issue is that flyers purported to be from 
Night Raid have been left at every crime scene.</b>

12:06.030 --> 12:08.580
<b>So they're trying to frame us.</b>

12:08.580 --> 12:11.250
<b>Isn't this a bit too obvious, though?</b>

12:11.250 --> 12:13.080
<b>Why would we suddenly start claiming responsibility?</b>

12:13.710 --> 12:16.090
<b>That's what I thought at first.</b>

12:16.090 --> 12:18.670
<b>But it seems people believe we are the culprits.</b>

12:18.670 --> 12:19.210
<b>Why?</b>

12:19.630 --> 12:23.630
<b>The murdered officials all had powerful guards.</b>

12:23.630 --> 12:25.970
<b>No ordinary criminals could have touched them.</b>

12:25.970 --> 12:29.470
<b>That means the killers are deliberately going after powerful targets.</b>

12:29.470 --> 12:31.560
<b>And if they're capable of that...</b>

12:31.560 --> 12:33.850
<b>...then they must be just as powerful as us.</b>

12:34.140 --> 12:36.150
<b>In other words, fellow Relic-wielders.</b>

12:36.150 --> 12:39.110
<b>Whoever it is, I strongly suspect they report directly to Esdeath.</b>

12:39.400 --> 12:40.990
<b>Why would they do this?</b>

12:40.990 --> 12:42.700
<b>It's a challenge.</b>

12:42.700 --> 12:44.700
<b>They mean to lure us into a trap.</b>

12:45.030 --> 12:48.580
<b>Since we know it's a trap, 
I'd like to tell you something.</b>

12:48.580 --> 12:52.000
<b>Not only were the targeted officials among the empire's brightest,</b>

12:52.000 --> 12:54.830
<b>they all opposed the current prime minister in hope of improving the government.</b>

12:55.250 --> 12:59.920
<b>These people will be the building blocks that form our new nation.</b>

13:01.880 --> 13:06.140
<b>We cannot afford to lose any more of them.</b>

13:06.840 --> 13:08.640
<b>I'd like to hear your thoughts.</b>

13:09.140 --> 13:10.100
<b>I...</b>

13:10.430 --> 13:13.180
<b>I don't know much about politics, but...</b>

13:13.180 --> 13:16.900
<b>We can't stand by and let them commit these crimes under Night Raid's name!</b>

13:18.190 --> 13:19.770
<b>You're right.</b>

13:19.770 --> 13:21.110
<b>That's exactly right, Tatsumi!</b>

13:21.440 --> 13:22.400
<b>Bro!</b>

13:24.780 --> 13:26.450
<b>Very well. Then it's decided!</b>

13:26.910 --> 13:29.280
<b>Show them what happens to those who falsely assume our name.</b>

13:29.280 --> 13:31.410
<b>Teach them what it really means to be an assassin.</b>

13:31.990 --> 13:35.040
<b>We've narrowed the next target down to two possible officials.</b>

13:35.040 --> 13:36.290
<b>Akame and Lubbock.</b>

13:36.290 --> 13:37.580
<b>Tatsumi and Bulat.</b>

13:37.580 --> 13:39.540
<b>Guard them in pairs.</b>

13:40.340 --> 13:43.420
<b>Where is the official we're guarding headed?</b>

13:43.420 --> 13:45.010
<b>The capital's outskirts.</b>

13:45.010 --> 13:48.930
<b>Anchored at the marina of the 
grand canal is a massive luxury liner,</b>

13:48.930 --> 13:50.350
<b>the <i>Ryuusen</i>.</b>

13:50.890 --> 13:55.770
<b>I-It's huge!</b>

13:59.730 --> 14:01.690
<b><i>This ship is like a fortress.</i></b>

14:02.400 --> 14:04.650
<b><i>So this is where we'll wait for the impostors.</i></b>

14:05.740 --> 14:07.240
<b>A relief mission, huh?</b>

14:07.240 --> 14:08.910
<b>Looks like they do care.</b>

14:10.410 --> 14:12.910
<b>That rice should help lift the people's spirits.</b>

14:14.450 --> 14:17.120
<b>Watching that made me hungry.</b>

14:17.120 --> 14:20.130
<b>Take this, then. I need you at full strength when the enemy shows up.</b>

14:23.550 --> 14:24.960
<b>Nothing yet.</b>

14:25.340 --> 14:27.840
<b>Maybe we're barking up the wrong tree.</b>

14:27.840 --> 14:29.390
<b>Don't let your guard down.</b>

14:29.390 --> 14:30.550
<b>I know.</b>

14:31.970 --> 14:34.100
<b><i>Tatsumi... Bulat...</i></b>

14:34.520 --> 14:36.730
<b><i>If you two should run into the enemy...</i></b>

14:38.770 --> 14:39.940
<b><i>Please...</i></b>

14:39.940 --> 14:41.860
<b><i>Make it out alive!</i></b>

14:48.740 --> 14:52.070
<b>The old man we're supposed to protect is surrounded by people.</b>

14:52.070 --> 14:54.660
<b>No way anyone could assassinate him here.</b>

14:54.660 --> 14:56.040
<b>Looks like this was a waste—</b>

14:56.620 --> 14:57.960
<b>Huh? Wh-What?</b>

14:57.960 --> 14:59.920
<b>That's a tough call to make on your own, Tatsumi.</b>

15:00.170 --> 15:02.080
<b>Eh? Bro?</b>

15:02.080 --> 15:04.880
<b>If anything happens, my invisibility will give me the upper hand.</b>

15:04.880 --> 15:07.050
<b>You can never be too careful, right?</b>

15:08.010 --> 15:09.130
<b>That's true.</b>

15:09.590 --> 15:11.300
<b>I'm sorry, Bro.</b>

15:12.010 --> 15:14.600
<b>Still, how many times have you hit me now?</b>

15:14.600 --> 15:16.600
<b>Just consider it tough love.</b>

15:16.600 --> 15:17.600
<b>Love.</b>

15:18.020 --> 15:19.060
<b>Love.</b>

15:19.060 --> 15:21.020
<b>You didn't have to repeat it!</b>

15:21.520 --> 15:24.230
<b>Anyway, that armor of yours sure is useful.</b>

15:24.940 --> 15:26.860
<b>We couldn't have boarded this ship without it.</b>

15:27.150 --> 15:28.030
<b>Yeah!</b>

15:28.030 --> 15:31.280
<b>We stuck together through thick and thin 
when I fought against the South.</b>

15:31.280 --> 15:33.240
<b>It's basically my partner.</b>

15:34.870 --> 15:36.080
<b>But...</b>

15:36.080 --> 15:38.500
<b>In the end, it didn't matter how hard I fought.</b>

15:41.790 --> 15:43.170
<b>This doesn't make any sense!</b>

15:43.170 --> 15:46.840
<b>Why would the capital dismiss you, General?</b>

15:46.840 --> 15:51.510
<b>I refused to bribe the new prime minister.</b>

15:51.510 --> 15:54.220
<b>So he decides his men based not on their merits but their bribes?</b>

15:54.220 --> 15:56.050
<b>That's ludicrous!</b>

15:56.050 --> 15:56.970
<b>Bulat.</b>

15:57.220 --> 16:01.230
<b>I will speak out in my own defense back at the capital.</b>

16:01.770 --> 16:05.520
<b>Though I may be a prisoner, 
I have committed no wrongdoing.</b>

16:05.520 --> 16:07.900
<b>I'm sure they'll understand.{uh huh}</b>

16:07.900 --> 16:08.980
<b>General...</b>

16:09.230 --> 16:12.530
<b>I'm sorry you had to serve under a fool like me.</b>

16:12.530 --> 16:14.530
<b>Forgive me, Bulat.</b>

16:15.280 --> 16:16.070
<b>No, sir.</b>

16:16.530 --> 16:17.700
<b>It was an honor.</b>

16:19.330 --> 16:23.250
<b>But when the general returned to the capital, they wouldn't even hear his case.</b>

16:24.000 --> 16:26.250
<b>I suppose they harbored some resentment for me as well,</b>

16:26.250 --> 16:28.460
<b>as I was also set up as a criminal.</b>

16:29.420 --> 16:34.180
<b>But before they could get their hands on me, 
I used this Relic to make my escape.</b>

16:34.180 --> 16:35.840
<b>That's ridiculous.</b>

16:37.050 --> 16:39.100
<b>The invisibility's almost run out.</b>

16:39.100 --> 16:41.270
<b>I'll have to remove the armor for a while.</b>

16:41.270 --> 16:43.520
<b>Don't they know your face, Bro?</b>

16:43.520 --> 16:45.150
<b>Leave this area to me!</b>

16:45.150 --> 16:45.940
<b>All right!</b>

16:45.940 --> 16:48.440
<b>I'll go investigate inside the ship.</b>

16:53.400 --> 16:56.160
<b>If I see anyone suspicious, I won't let them get away.</b>

16:56.160 --> 16:59.120
<b>Though I'm pretty suspicious-looking myself.</b>

<b>I have to get outside!</b>

18:25.500 --> 18:27.120
<b>I can still hear the flute out here.</b>

18:27.460 --> 18:29.540
<b>It must be an Imperial Relic.</b>

<b>Oh, looks like someone's still on their feet.</b>

<b>What are you doing?</b>

18:47.350 --> 18:48.600
<b>Well...</b>

18:48.600 --> 18:51.310
<b>I want to gain experience in battle</b>

<b>Ah, I see.</b>

<b>Well, then, how would you like to experience</b>

<b>a one-way trip to Hell?!</b>

18:59.910 --> 19:01.070
<b>Excellent!</b>

19:01.070 --> 19:02.410
<b>That's the spirit!</b>

19:02.410 --> 19:04.530
<b>Obliterating you will be worth every moment!</b>

19:10.120 --> 19:13.380
<b>You did well to dodge that under the effects of the music.</b>

19:13.380 --> 19:15.300
<b>Well, then...</b>

19:15.670 --> 19:17.510
<b>How about this?</b>

19:27.520 --> 19:29.730
<b>So that's your Imperial Relic?</b>

19:29.980 --> 19:32.600
<b>That's right. The Twofold Cleaver, Belvark.</b>

19:32.600 --> 19:34.980

<b>The opponent was clearly anticipating your attack!</b>

19:48.580 --> 19:50.410
<b>Any idiot could see he would've come out on top!</b>

19:50.410 --> 19:52.710
<b>What were you doing, plunging in like that?!</b>

19:53.460 --> 19:54.250
<b>Hey, you.</b>

19:54.250 --> 19:55.710
<b>You're awfully chipper.</b>

19:56.090 --> 20:00.050
<b>The debilitating music should have affected the entire ship.</b>

20:00.050 --> 20:02.300
<b>Oh, so that's what that little performance was for.</b>

20:02.300 --> 20:04.430
<b>Sorry to say, but you're out of luck.</b>
