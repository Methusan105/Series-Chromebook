<b>Captain Esdeath is away on an expedition.</b>

<b>Yeah. It won't be long before

05:10.490 --> 05:12.450
<b>Of course I am.</b>

05:12.450 --> 05:16.250

<b>The aqueducts here sure are elaborate.</b>

<b>They must have grown bigger and bigger

05:37.230 --> 05:40.730
<b>And they were managed so poorly

<b>Then does that mean there are other

08:47.630 --> 08:49.920
<b>Oh, that's reassuring.</b>

08:49.920 --> 08:56.260

10:25.600 --> 10:26.640
<b>Why did you do it?</b>

10:26.640 --> 10:28.390
<b>Why do you think?</b>

10:28.890 --> 10:30.770
<b>Because it was fun!</b>

10:31.900 --> 10:35.110
<b>I despise boredom.</b>

10:35.110 --> 10:38.490
<b>Thanks to them, I had a great time.</b>

10:38.490 --> 10:41.490
<b>You bastard!</b>

10:41.490 --> 10:42.070
<b>Tatsumi!</b>

10:49.920 --> 10:51.290
<b>Wh-What is this?</b>

10:51.710 --> 10:54.840
<b>So some rats snuck in, just as I expected.</b>

11:00.720 --> 11:04.720
<b>Hey! You came at just the right time, 
Old Man Lightning.</b>

11:04.720 --> 11:06.720
<b>I'll leave them to you.</b>

11:06.720 --> 11:08.730
<b>I don't need you to tell me that.</b>

11:10.060 --> 11:12.310
<b>My name is Budo.</b>

11:12.310 --> 11:15.820
<b>I've been appointed Commander-in-Chief by our lord and master.</b>

11:16.230 --> 11:18.400
<b><i>So this is the Commander-in-Chief.</i></b>

11:18.400 --> 11:21.780
<b>You've wronged the empire with your treasonous acts.</b>

11:22.320 --> 11:28.040
<b>Prepare to be judged by my Imperial Relic: 
the Thunder God's Rage, Adramelech!</b>

11:34.500 --> 11:35.170
<b>Tatsumi!</b>

11:38.550 --> 11:39.260
<b>Crap...</b>

11:39.260 --> 11:41.840
<b>His blow didn't even connect, so how did it hit so hard?</b>

11:42.180 --> 11:45.640
<b>Oh, so you dodged my attack.</b>

11:45.640 --> 11:47.600
<b>You've got a good eye.</b>

11:48.720 --> 11:52.190
<b>Incursio!</b>

11:57.230 --> 11:58.690
<b>Tatsumi!</b>

12:05.410 --> 12:07.410
<b>What the hell? How did you get there?</b>

12:07.410 --> 12:09.700
<b>I'll be your opponent.</b>

12:10.330 --> 12:12.040
<b>Don't any of you interfere!</b>

12:12.040 --> 12:14.750
<b>This one's my prey.{end of part a}</b>

12:17.800 --> 12:18.880
<b>That was fun.</b>

12:19.670 --> 12:24.430
<b>Clearly, I am better suited to the battlefield than to guard duty.</b>

12:32.390 --> 12:35.100
<b>We're heading back to the capital.</b>

12:36.230 --> 12:39.860
<b><i>You had best prepare yourselves, Night Raid.{there's a fun phrase used here where she says "wash your necks", as in prepare to die via beheading}</i></b>

12:45.410 --> 12:46.370
<b>What?</b>

12:46.370 --> 12:48.660
<b>Pay attention, Night Raid dog!</b>

12:51.700 --> 12:52.750
<b>Oh?</b>

12:53.160 --> 12:54.710
<b>A Relic made from wires?</b>

12:54.710 --> 12:56.500
<b>That's pretty interesting.</b>

12:57.330 --> 13:01.590
<b>Don't look so surprised. 
I'll tell you how mine works too.</b>

13:01.590 --> 13:08.680
<b>My toy, Shambhala, can teleport me or anyone else...</b>

13:09.390 --> 13:12.520
<b>just as long as I've marked the location first.</b>

13:13.230 --> 13:15.350
<b><i>An Imperial Relic that controls time and space?</i></b>

13:15.350 --> 13:20.070
<b>It's pretty damn exhausting, 
so I wasn't able to attack repeatedly before.</b>

13:23.280 --> 13:26.240
<b>But I got hold of something awesome in the capital.</b>

13:27.610 --> 13:31.120
<b>Now I can teleport as much as I want.</b>

13:31.620 --> 13:36.670
<b>And as you can see, I've made a whole lot 
of markings all over the palace!</b>

13:40.880 --> 13:42.840
<b>What's wrong? Not gonna run?</b>

13:47.800 --> 13:50.390
<b>Hey, hey, is that all you've got?</b>

13:51.060 --> 13:53.020
<b><i>There's no point in trying to run away.</i></b>

13:53.020 --> 13:55.770
<b><i>No matter where I go, he can reach me in an instant!</i></b>

13:56.230 --> 13:57.560
<b><i>But...</i></b>

13:57.560 --> 14:01.270
<b><i>He won't be able to get to me 
in an area he hasn't marked.</i></b>

14:09.200 --> 14:11.700
<b>Sucks to be you, huh?</b>

14:11.700 --> 14:14.080
<b>You can even leave marks in the air?</b>

14:14.450 --> 14:16.250
<b>Got it in one.</b>

14:16.250 --> 14:19.250
<b>There was nowhere for you to run 
from the very start.</b>

14:19.250 --> 14:20.500
<b>Not a single damn place.</b>

14:29.390 --> 14:32.220
<b><i>He may be strong, but his attacks leave openings.</i></b>

14:32.220 --> 14:33.180
<b><i>I can do this!</i></b>

14:44.270 --> 14:46.530
<b>Young man, what are you called?</b>

14:46.530 --> 14:47.240
<b>Huh?</b>

14:47.240 --> 14:48.400
<b>Your name.</b>

14:48.820 --> 14:52.030
<b>Unless assassins don't have names.</b>

14:52.030 --> 14:53.120
<b>It's Tatsumi.</b>

14:53.490 --> 14:54.990
<b><i>Tatsumi?</i></b>

14:54.990 --> 14:56.750
<b><i>How earnest.</i></b>

14:56.750 --> 14:58.500
<b><i>How honest.</i></b>

14:59.000 --> 15:02.210
<b><i>He hasn't faltered once in his swordsmanship.</i></b>

15:02.210 --> 15:07.970
<b><i>How much discipline does one need to become this skilled?</i></b>

15:07.970 --> 15:08.800
<b><i>However...</i></b>

15:12.760 --> 15:16.560
<b><i>Those who wrong the empire or His Majesty</i></b>

15:16.560 --> 15:19.180
<b><i>must be destroyed!</i></b>

15:28.940 --> 15:30.070
<b>Tatsumi!</b>

15:31.780 --> 15:32.410
<b>You?!</b>

15:32.410 --> 15:33.240
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

15:33.240 --> 15:33.740
<b>What—</b>

15:33.740 --> 15:35.240
<b>If I don't do this,</b>

15:34.160 --> 15:37.240
<b>Hey! Let go of me!</b>

15:35.240 --> 15:37.240
<b>my father and mother...</b>

15:42.080 --> 15:43.080
<b>Huh?</b>

15:44.040 --> 15:46.210
<b>Didn't I say not to interfere?</b>

15:47.460 --> 15:50.840
<b>A toy like you has some goddamn nerve 
butting in on my fight.</b>

15:50.840 --> 15:53.340
<b>A toy?</b>

15:53.340 --> 15:54.600
<b>That's right!</b>

15:54.600 --> 15:58.430
<b>This capital and everyone in it... They're all my toys!</b>

15:58.430 --> 16:02.440
<b>And one day, I'll surpass my father and the very throne will be mine.</b>

16:03.940 --> 16:06.770
<b>Hey, don't tell me you're giving up.</b>

16:06.770 --> 16:08.820
<b>Our game's not over yet.</b>

16:08.820 --> 16:11.490
<b>No, it's over.</b>

16:11.490 --> 16:12.570
<b>You lose.</b>

16:12.570 --> 16:13.450
<b>Huh?</b>

16:21.710 --> 16:22.500
<b>Commander Syura!</b>

16:22.500 --> 16:23.830
<b>Don't move.</b>

16:23.830 --> 16:25.710
<b>Or I'll cut off more than just his hand.</b>

16:25.710 --> 16:27.250
<b>You...</b>

16:28.090 --> 16:29.550
<b>What's this?</b>

16:29.550 --> 16:31.970
<b>I spread my wires out over the area.</b>

16:31.970 --> 16:36.220
<b>It was close, but I just barely had enough to cover it all.</b>

16:36.220 --> 16:39.100
<b>You did this while you were running around?</b>

16:39.100 --> 16:45.150
<b>I figured out where most of the marks were 
while you were busy showing off.{literally shinji}</b>

16:45.150 --> 16:46.400
<b>You bastard...</b>

16:46.400 --> 16:49.230
<b>Now, everyone drop their weapons!</b>

16:49.230 --> 16:53.450
<b>I have a lot of questions I'd like to ask you, Syura.</b>

16:56.160 --> 16:57.910
<b>Y-You...</b>

17:00.370 --> 17:04.830
<b>M-Master Syura, please take this into account.</b>

17:04.830 --> 17:08.500
<b>And let my father... and my mother... go...</b>

17:14.680 --> 17:20.310
<b>Too bad! Your parents were killed a long time ago!{top akame}</b>

17:20.760 --> 17:24.060
<b>Thanks for the entertainment, Night Raid dog.</b>

17:24.060 --> 17:27.900
<b>But I think it's about time we ended this.</b>

17:27.900 --> 17:31.480
<b>I'll let you have a taste of my hidden ability.</b>

17:32.650 --> 17:35.740
<b>Disappear off the face of the world!</b>

17:46.250 --> 17:50.170
<b>No one's ever come back from there.</b>

17:51.460 --> 17:55.050
<b>Crumble into dust in the abyss, Night Raid dog!</b>

17:56.170 --> 17:56.880
<b>Huh?</b>

17:57.680 --> 17:58.800
<b><i>A wire?</i></b>

17:58.800 --> 18:00.010
<b><i>Don't tell me...</i></b>

18:00.010 --> 18:01.640
<b><i>That son of a bitch!</i></b>

18:01.640 --> 18:06.310
<b>No one can cut these wires, 
no matter who they are.</b>

18:06.310 --> 18:09.480
<b>Not even Relic-wielders who can manipulate time and space!</b>

18:12.480 --> 18:14.610
<b>So we meet again.</b>

18:14.610 --> 18:16.570
<b>You...</b>

18:18.160 --> 18:19.870
<b>You're not getting away!</b>

18:22.780 --> 18:25.290
<b>Don't look at me like that.</b>

18:25.290 --> 18:27.790
<b>Let's travel to the other side together, my good Syura.</b>

18:27.790 --> 18:29.580
<b>To hell with that!</b>

18:29.580 --> 18:32.210
<b>I can't die here.</b>

18:32.210 --> 18:36.420
<b>I need the throne so I can change this boring world!</b>

18:36.420 --> 18:40.760
<b>It's not like I don't get where you're coming from.</b>

18:41.680 --> 18:44.930
<b>Damn it! I can't die here!</b>

18:44.930 --> 18:46.270
<b>I'm going to rule the empire!</b>

18:46.270 --> 18:49.600
<b>You want to change the world, huh?</b>

18:49.600 --> 18:53.400
<b>I understand. Everyone feels that way.</b>

18:54.520 --> 19:00.110
<b>But that doesn't give you the right to treat other people like toys.</b>

19:00.110 --> 19:03.330
<b>You can't just destroy whatever you want!</b>

19:26.180 --> 19:28.520
<b>We've been through a lot together,</b>

19:29.310 --> 19:31.140
<b>Cross Tail.</b>

19:43.200 --> 19:45.830
<b>I'm sorry, Miss Najenda.</b>

19:46.410 --> 19:49.080
<b>Seems like this is it for me.</b>

19:50.250 --> 19:53.460
<b>I'll leave the rest to you, Tatsumi.</b>

20:09.770 --> 20:10.390
<b>Lu...</b>

20:11.980 --> 20:13.020
<b>Lubb...</b>

20:13.730 --> 20:17.570
<b>Lubb!</b>

20:20.030 --> 20:24.030
<b>D-D-Dead?</b>

20:26.780 --> 20:30.080
<b>No, Syura!</b>

20:30.080 --> 20:34.460
<b>How could you leave me behind?</b>

20:34.920 --> 20:36.540
<b>Oh, well.</b>

20:36.540 --> 20:40.260
<b>These things happen, you know.</b>

20:40.260 --> 20:46.340
<b>At least he took one of 
Night Raid's members with him.</b>

20:46.340 --> 20:50.850
<b>We've placed the other one in the dungeon.</b>

20:50.850 --> 20:52.230
<b>Good work.</b>

20:52.230 --> 20:54.190
<b>Now, then.</b>

20:56.230 --> 20:58.440
<b>We need to make an example out of him</b>

20:58.900 --> 21:03.320
<b>so the Revolutionary Army knows to back down.</b>

21:03.320 --> 21:08.240
<b>I wonder what awful things we should do to him.</b>

21:12.250 --> 21:14.870
<b>You're as mean-spirited as ever, I see.</b>

21:14.870 --> 21:21.000
<b>It would likely be effective in 
discouraging traitors, though.</b>

21:22.460 --> 21:25.130
<b>I heard what happened, Budo.</b>

21:25.130 --> 21:27.260
<b>Allow me to take care of this.</b>

21:27.760 --> 21:28.850
<b>Oh?</b>

21:29.350 --> 21:30.310
<b><i>Tatsumi...</i></b>

21:31.180 --> 21:33.270
<b><i>I won't let anyone else have you.</i></b>
