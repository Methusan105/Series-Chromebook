03:19.170 --> 03:25.100
<b>And here's my new Imperial Relic, 
courtesy of the Revolutionary Army:</b>

03:25.100 --> 03:27.430
<b>The Lightning-Speed Warrior, Susanoo.</b>

03:27.430 --> 03:31.060
<b>He's an autonomous living Relic, 
so he's easy to handle.</b>

03:31.570 --> 03:33.960
<b>In other words, even I can use him.</b>

03:33.960 --> 03:35.900
<b>N-Nice to meet you again.</b>

03:38.910 --> 03:40.180
<b>Wh-What?</b>

03:42.910 --> 03:43.910
<b>There.</b>

03:44.470 --> 03:46.960
<b>He's a real neat freak, surprisingly enough.</b>

03:46.960 --> 03:48.700
<b>First time I've seen a Relic like that.</b>

03:49.700 --> 03:52.460
<b>Actually, he also fixed my hair, didn't he?</b>

03:52.460 --> 03:56.040
<b>So what's his power?</b>

03:56.040 --> 03:57.710
<b>Is he just physically strong, or what?</b>

04:00.720 --> 04:02.680
<b>Allow us to demonstrate.</b>

04:02.680 --> 04:03.930
<b>Don't be too surprised.</b>

04:05.140 --> 04:06.890
<b>Do it, Susanoo!</b>

04:07.390 --> 04:08.140
<b>Understood.</b>

04:24.610 --> 04:27.600
<b>Uh, not to say this isn't amazing, but...</b>

04:27.600 --> 04:28.860
<b>What the hell?</b>

04:28.860 --> 04:31.580
<b>It looks like he's just doing household chores.</b>

04:31.580 --> 04:32.830
<b>Precisely!</b>

04:33.570 --> 04:37.700
<b>Susanoo was originally created as a bodyguard Relic.</b>

04:37.700 --> 04:39.100
<b>He's a powerful fighter, of course,</b>

04:39.100 --> 04:42.700
<b>but he's also trained to do housework 
while he protects you.</b>

04:42.700 --> 04:44.860
<b>Cleaning, laundry, everything!</b>

04:45.640 --> 04:45.680
Chores

04:45.640 --> 04:45.680
Chores

04:45.640 --> 04:45.680
Fighting

04:45.640 --> 04:45.680
Fighting

04:45.680 --> 04:46.720
Chores

04:45.680 --> 04:46.720
Chores

04:45.680 --> 04:46.720
Fighting

04:45.680 --> 04:46.720
Fighting

04:46.020 --> 04:49.310
<b>He's able to prepare over a thousand dishes.</b>

04:46.720 --> 04:49.310
Chores

04:46.720 --> 04:47.640
Chores

04:46.720 --> 04:49.260

04:46.720 --> 04:49.260

04:47.640 --> 04:49.310
Chores

Fighting

04:49.260 --> 04:49.310
Fighting

04:49.310 --> 04:51.820
<b>That has nothing to do with fighting!</b>

04:49.310 --> 04:49.350
Chores

04:49.310 --> 04:49.350
Chores

04:51.820 --> 04:53.980
<b>He's extremely convenient, though!</b>

04:54.510 --> 04:58.240
<b>Anyway, he also has a hidden combat ability, of course.</b>

04:58.240 --> 04:59.120
<b>Right?</b>

04:59.120 --> 04:59.770
<b>Yes.</b>

05:03.930 --> 05:06.640
<b><i>So these two are our new comrades.</i></b>

05:06.640 --> 05:08.370
<b><i>They seem quite dependable!</i></b>

05:08.370 --> 05:11.990
<b>Hey, you flat-chested shrimp! 
How's the washboard?</b>

05:12.450 --> 05:15.660
<b>You may be a handsome guy who can cook,
but you're just a Relic, right?</b>

05:15.660 --> 05:17.580
<b>Yeah, you're no threat to me.</b>

05:18.030 --> 05:20.800
<b><i>But I'm a bit worried about 
the teamwork side of things.</i></b>

05:29.370 --> 05:31.600
<b>We finished searching the doctor's residence.</b>

05:32.190 --> 05:37.340
<b>However, we couldn't find any clues to explain his disappearance or hint at his whereabouts.</b>

05:37.910 --> 05:43.180
<b>All his important experimental materials
and equipment were left in the lab, though.</b>

05:43.970 --> 05:45.530
<b>So he didn't run away.</b>

05:46.610 --> 05:48.380
<b>That means he was indeed killed.</b>

05:49.590 --> 05:52.900
<b>His enhanced soldiers have also disappeared.</b>

05:53.450 --> 05:55.910
<b>We believe they all perished in battle.</b>

05:56.690 --> 05:58.040
<b>All right.</b>

05:58.970 --> 06:02.180
<b>Which means Seryu lost another mentor figure.</b>

06:05.730 --> 06:08.970
<b>How are you managing without Stylish?</b>

06:09.670 --> 06:10.980
<b>I'm fine!</b>

06:10.980 --> 06:13.310
<b>There's plenty of equipment left in his lab.</b>

06:13.710 --> 06:17.380
<b>I can't do additions or modifications, 
but I can keep up my maintenance.</b>

06:18.090 --> 06:19.150
<b>I see.</b>

06:24.530 --> 06:29.380
<b>Seryu, how's the Judgment of the Ten Kings 
and your other weaponry doing?</b>

06:29.380 --> 06:31.960
<b>All working perfectly, Doctor!</b>

06:31.960 --> 06:35.380
<b>You made it through my experiments in fine form.</b>

06:35.380 --> 06:38.410
<b>Now, please use those powers to achieve your goals.</b>

06:39.330 --> 06:41.420
<b>If you get hurt, I'll be here for you.</b>

06:43.330 --> 06:44.380
<b>Right!</b>

06:50.850 --> 06:54.920
<b>My parents... My teacher... My benefactor...</b>

06:55.750 --> 07:00.740
<b>Those criminals won't stop until 
they've taken away all my loved ones.</b>

07:02.610 --> 07:03.900
<b>Seryu...</b>

07:04.290 --> 07:05.520
<b>Captain...</b>

07:05.520 --> 07:07.960
<b>I can't stand this!</b>

07:08.530 --> 07:12.620
<b>I want to wipe them out as soon as possible!</b>

07:19.430 --> 07:23.680
<b>If you stick with me, 
I'll help you realize that wish.</b>

07:24.510 --> 07:25.540
<b>You can count on it.</b>

07:27.350 --> 07:28.760
<b>Captain...</b>

07:29.550 --> 07:31.120
<b>Thank you very much.</b>

07:31.970 --> 07:36.590
<b>I will dedicate my strength,
my very life to you. To justice.</b>

07:36.590 --> 07:37.340
<b>Good.</b>

07:41.230 --> 07:42.060
<b>All right!</b>

07:42.060 --> 07:45.440
<b>I know just the thing to cheer Seryu up.</b>

07:45.440 --> 07:47.270
<b>I don't think you've got much chance, Wave.</b>

07:47.270 --> 07:49.400
<b>My mom always told me:</b>

07:49.400 --> 07:54.300
<b>"If you see a girl lookin' unhappy, 
be a man and help her."</b>

07:55.430 --> 07:56.280
<b>Oh?</b>

07:56.280 --> 07:58.120
<b>Now is the time for action!</b>

07:58.120 --> 08:00.370
<b>Seryu, I'm here for you!{rekt}</b>

08:09.470 --> 08:13.470
<b>It appears the empire is also steadily strengthening its forces.</b>

08:13.470 --> 08:16.000
<b>As we are, we still lack power.</b>

08:16.590 --> 08:17.970
<b>We have to become stronger.</b>

08:18.730 --> 08:20.580
<b>The day of revolution draws near.</b>

08:20.580 --> 08:22.850
<b>We'll need all the time we have to train.</b>

08:23.490 --> 08:25.880
<b>We probably won't be able 
to get any more outside help,</b>

08:26.470 --> 08:29.630
<b>so think of these new members 
as the last ones we'll be getting.</b>

08:29.630 --> 08:33.560
<b>Let's get through this and 
welcome the revolution together.</b>

08:45.040 --> 08:45.790
<b>A bite!</b>

08:51.590 --> 08:52.470
<b>There.</b>

08:55.470 --> 08:58.180
<b>We're going to feast tonight, Su.</b>

08:59.060 --> 09:00.930
<b>Whew!</b>

09:00.930 --> 09:03.640
<b>Su's cooking is delicious!</b>

09:03.640 --> 09:05.560
<b>My training fatigue is like a distant memory!</b>

09:05.560 --> 09:07.190
<b>Thank you, Su.</b>

09:07.810 --> 09:09.940
<b>Su, let's train together tomorrow!</b>

09:10.980 --> 09:13.820
<b>What'd I tell you? Susanoo's amazing.</b>

09:14.240 --> 09:18.530
<b>I'm surprised the Revolutionary Army 
was willing to let such a useful Relic go.</b>

09:18.530 --> 09:19.530
<b>Actually...</b>

09:19.530 --> 09:22.040
<b>Susanoo had been dormant this whole time,</b>

09:22.040 --> 09:24.370
<b>but he started up again when I was near.</b>

09:24.960 --> 09:26.250
<b>That's our boss.</b>

09:27.000 --> 09:28.460
<b>What can I say?</b>

09:29.500 --> 09:31.710
<b>I guess it's my natural charm.</b>

09:32.550 --> 09:36.050
<b>Najenda looks just like my old master.</b>

09:36.050 --> 09:37.380
<b>Oh, I see.</b>

09:37.380 --> 09:39.720
<b>I'm sure your master was a wonderful person.</b>

09:40.180 --> 09:41.180
<b>Indeed.</b>

09:41.640 --> 09:44.180
<b>He was an exemplary general!</b>

09:44.180 --> 09:45.020
<b>"He"?!</b>

09:47.940 --> 09:50.020
<b>He said you look like a guy!</b>

09:50.020 --> 09:53.360
<b>So the boss is a pretty boy now? That's so her!</b>

09:50.020 --> 09:53.360
<b>Leone, we shouldn't be laughing at—</b>

09:55.570 --> 09:57.240
<b>Uh, well, you see...</b>

09:57.240 --> 09:58.410
<b>Um...</b>

10:03.620 --> 10:07.160
<b>They got all buddy-buddy with Su awfully fast.</b>

10:07.160 --> 10:09.580
<b>He's stealing my position as the likable guy.</b>

10:09.580 --> 10:12.630
<b>I'm pretty sure you've always been the comic relief, Lubb.</b>

10:15.710 --> 10:16.340
<b>Oh?</b>

10:16.670 --> 10:19.050
<b>A baby Marg panther?</b>

10:21.430 --> 10:23.970
<b>Those things don't fear humans at all, do they?</b>

10:26.180 --> 10:27.270
<b>What?</b>

10:27.270 --> 10:29.440
<b>I'm telling you right now,
I don't have any food for—</b>

10:30.770 --> 10:32.940
<b>C-Can't say no to those eyes.</b>

10:39.950 --> 10:41.740
<b>Meow-ch obliged.</b>

10:42.780 --> 10:43.780
<b>Chelsea!</b>

10:45.120 --> 10:48.120
<b>You're far too trusting, Mine.</b>

10:48.870 --> 10:50.500
<b>Wh-Why, you...</b>

10:51.000 --> 10:53.090
<b>So that's your Imperial Relic, Chelsea?</b>

10:53.090 --> 10:56.130
<b>Yep! It lets me change into whatever I like.</b>

10:57.510 --> 11:01.470
<b>Pretty nifty, huh? It's called "Gaea Foundation."</b>

11:01.470 --> 11:06.180
<b>Mine, if you don't sharpen up, 
you might wind up dead.</b>

11:06.180 --> 11:07.270
<b>What?!</b>

11:07.270 --> 11:09.480
<b>If the enemy sees through your Relic, it's all over!</b>

11:09.480 --> 11:13.860
<b>That's true. My Relic doesn't help in battle; it's purely cosmetic.{yeah semicolon i went there}{hue}</b>

11:14.440 --> 11:17.690
<b>But that's exactly why I love it.</b>

11:17.690 --> 11:20.150
<b>That shocked look on your face just now, Mine...</b>

11:20.650 --> 11:21.990
<b>I wouldn't trade it for the world.</b>

11:22.870 --> 11:25.410
<b>She pisses me off so much!</b>

11:38.300 --> 11:40.470
<b>Tatsumi, I'll leave the small fry to you.</b>

11:40.470 --> 11:41.430
<b>Got it!</b>

11:42.590 --> 11:44.890
<b><i>These guys deal a lot of damage.</i></b>

11:44.890 --> 11:48.970
<b><i>I'll watch their movements and stay just out of range.</i></b>

11:53.440 --> 11:55.060
<b><i>Then I'll eliminate them!</i></b>

11:59.530 --> 12:00.650
<b><i>That's...</i></b>

12:01.990 --> 12:05.120
<b><i>Incursio's auxiliary weapon, Neuntöter!</i></b>

12:06.160 --> 12:07.580
<b><i>That Tatsumi...</i></b>

12:09.080 --> 12:11.370
<b><i>Since when can he use that?</i></b>

12:13.750 --> 12:17.040
<b><i>He's becoming more like Bulat, little by little.</i></b>

12:24.260 --> 12:26.800
<b>There's no end to these guys.</b>

12:26.800 --> 12:28.930
<b>They just keep calling more reinforcements.</b>

12:29.600 --> 12:31.350
<b>I have to take out their leader.</b>

12:41.490 --> 12:42.360
<b>Found you!</b>

12:58.500 --> 12:59.670
<b>Whoa there.</b>

13:00.460 --> 13:02.260
<b>I guess that's your hidden ability.</b>

13:11.810 --> 13:13.430
<b>This area's ours!</b>

13:14.640 --> 13:18.690
<b>We certainly took out those Danger Beasts easily.</b>

13:18.690 --> 13:23.360
<b>There are all kinds of other things that could attack us, so we gotta keep our guard up.</b>

13:23.360 --> 13:26.280
<b>Not a problem. That just makes things more fun!</b>

13:26.280 --> 13:27.870
<b>The air's a bit thin here,</b>

13:27.870 --> 13:30.740
<b>but you were still able to fight.</b>

13:30.740 --> 13:32.870
<b>You guys have leveled up quite a bit, huh?</b>

13:32.870 --> 13:35.750
<b>You're right. I can totally feel it.</b>

13:36.210 --> 13:37.210
<b>Chelsea.</b>

13:37.830 --> 13:41.130
<b>You've seen how we work here at Night Raid for a month now. What do you think?</b>

13:41.550 --> 13:43.760
<b>You guys are pretty strong.</b>

13:43.760 --> 13:46.430
<b>More so than my last team, that's for sure.</b>

13:47.470 --> 13:48.220
<b>All right!</b>

13:48.220 --> 13:49.430
<b><i>We made her admit it!</i></b>

13:49.430 --> 13:50.390
<b>But...</b>

13:51.140 --> 13:54.310
<b>You need more than just strength to survive.</b>

13:54.310 --> 13:56.850
<b>I took a look through your records.</b>

13:57.230 --> 14:00.980
<b>Sheele and Bulat, the two who died in the line of duty...</b>

14:00.980 --> 14:03.400
<b>I'm sure they were great people,</b>

14:03.730 --> 14:06.150
<b>but they weren't cut out to be assassins.</b>

14:07.490 --> 14:10.370
<b>If the rest of you don't harden up,</b>

14:10.870 --> 14:14.580
<b>I don't think you'll survive much longer.</b>

14:15.040 --> 14:18.370
<b>She pisses me off to no end.</b>

14:18.370 --> 14:21.090
<b>As honest as ever, I see.</b>

14:22.840 --> 14:23.920
<b>First things first.</b>

14:24.340 --> 14:28.130
<b>Let's cook all of the beasts we've hunted.</b>

14:28.130 --> 14:29.890
<b>Can't fight on an empty stomach!</b>

14:30.510 --> 14:32.890
<b>You two couldn't care less, could you?</b>

14:40.230 --> 14:42.860
<b>Well? What did you want to discuss, Mine?</b>

14:42.860 --> 14:44.940
<b>Are you guys just gonna let that slide?</b>

14:44.940 --> 14:48.150
<b>You know, what she said about Sheele and Bulat.</b>

14:48.740 --> 14:50.610
<b>Well, I mean...</b>

14:50.610 --> 14:52.990
<b>I don't want to hear people badmouthing Bro either.</b>

14:52.990 --> 14:55.790
<b>Then let's teach Chelsea a lesson.</b>

14:55.790 --> 14:58.870
<b>Catch her off guard, say "gotcha," 
and laugh in her face!</b>

14:59.290 --> 15:03.630
<b>And while she's in shock, I'll deal the finishing blow and declare victory!</b>

15:03.960 --> 15:05.250
<b>It's perfect.</b>

15:07.210 --> 15:10.220
<b>I get the feeling that teaming up with you only invites disaster.</b>

15:10.220 --> 15:13.930
<b>What's this? You guys are on my side, right?</b>

15:14.350 --> 15:15.260
<b>Right?</b>

15:15.260 --> 15:17.850
<b>Yeah, yeah.</b>

15:17.850 --> 15:20.730
<b>But how are we gonna do this?</b>

15:20.730 --> 15:23.650
<b>You work that out with Lubb.</b>

15:23.650 --> 15:26.320
<b>I'll come up with my own plan.</b>

15:27.280 --> 15:29.780
<b>Got it? We're gonna settle this tonight.</b>

15:30.320 --> 15:31.990
<b>Time to serve her a slice of humble pie!</b>

15:33.370 --> 15:35.370
<b>She's as headstrong as always.</b>

15:37.080 --> 15:39.250
<b>So how are we supposed to teach her a lesson?</b>

15:39.250 --> 15:44.080
<b>Well, I guess we could use our Relics.</b>

15:44.590 --> 15:48.170
<b>Eureka! I just had an idea! A great idea!</b>

16:02.850 --> 16:05.480
<b><i>I never thought I'd be using my Relic for </i>this.</b>

16:06.020 --> 16:09.860
<b>Listen up. It's almost time for Chelsea's bath.</b>

16:10.400 --> 16:13.110
<b>You turn invisible and sneak in after her.</b>

16:13.700 --> 16:19.290
<b>While she's in the bath, you get close 
and shove a bucket over her head.</b>

16:19.290 --> 16:21.210
<b>She won't know what hit her!</b>

16:23.000 --> 16:25.080
<b>Are you sure that's okay?</b>

16:25.080 --> 16:26.000
<b>You fool!</b>

16:26.000 --> 16:29.800
<b>Mine's orders are all the justification we need!</b>

16:29.800 --> 16:31.340
<b>This is our only chance.</b>

16:31.920 --> 16:33.800
<b>B-But...</b>

16:34.510 --> 16:37.470
<b>You won't be able to come with me, Lubb.</b>

16:39.970 --> 16:42.350
<b>That's fine. I'll let you have this one, so go!</b>

16:42.350 --> 16:43.310
<b>Lubb...</b>

16:44.100 --> 16:45.520
<b><i>Yeah, right.</i></b>

16:45.520 --> 16:50.190
<b><i>This way, I can learn how angry Chelsea will get 
if someone peeps on her in the bath.</i></b>

16:50.190 --> 16:53.610
<b><i>If she's the forgive-and-forget type, 
I'm totally getting a piece of that!</i></b>

16:58.080 --> 17:00.830
<b><i>I'd feel bad if I stared for too long, 
so I'll make this quick.</i></b>

17:02.080 --> 17:03.750
<b><i>But then again...</i></b>

17:05.870 --> 17:07.790
<b><i>I do kinda want to see.</i></b>

17:08.210 --> 17:11.710
<b>The adolescent young man is conflicted.</b>

17:08.210 --> 17:11.710
<b>The adolescent young man is conflicted.</b>

17:15.180 --> 17:16.590
<b><i>All right. Here we go!</i></b>

17:34.110 --> 17:35.740
<b><i>It's a guy?!</i></b>

17:36.320 --> 17:38.740
<b>Where are you? I know you're there.</b>

17:42.790 --> 17:45.210
<b>S-Su? How did you...{missed stutter}</b>

17:45.620 --> 17:49.380
<b>Incursio can turn its wearer invisible, but that is all.</b>

17:49.380 --> 17:51.630
<b>It cannot conceal their presence.</b>

17:53.010 --> 17:55.720
<b>Don't forget that. Or else...</b>

17:55.720 --> 17:56.800
<b>you will die.</b>

18:01.100 --> 18:01.810
<b>Yeah.</b>

18:04.520 --> 18:05.680
<b>Gotcha.</b>

18:06.180 --> 18:08.230
<b>Huh? Wh-What?!</b>

18:11.020 --> 18:13.190
<b>It was me all along.</b>

18:14.280 --> 18:17.900
<b>I could feel your presence getting closer,</b>

18:17.900 --> 18:20.780
<b>so I thought I'd turn the tables on you.</b>

18:20.780 --> 18:23.540
<b>So that's why you transformed before I saw you.</b>

18:24.160 --> 18:25.410
<b>You got me.</b>

18:26.370 --> 18:28.500
<b>Deception is my specialty.</b>

18:28.500 --> 18:31.630
<b>You're gonna need a lot more practice 
before you can pull a fast one on me!</b>

18:32.170 --> 18:34.760
<b>Would you get mad if I said that?</b>

18:35.840 --> 18:36.470
<b>No.</b>

18:36.470 --> 18:37.720
<b>Oh?</b>

18:37.720 --> 18:40.010
<b>You were right about the invisibility.</b>

18:40.510 --> 18:42.800
<b>Everything you said is true.</b>

18:43.640 --> 18:45.390
<b>I'll remember that when I fight.</b>

18:49.390 --> 18:52.310
<b>Oh? You seem level-headed.</b>

18:52.730 --> 18:54.190
<b>You see...</b>

18:54.190 --> 19:00.070
<b>My whole team was killed on the job 
just recently. I was the only survivor.</b>

19:02.410 --> 19:06.040
<b>I don't want that to happen to you guys as well.</b>

19:06.950 --> 19:10.210
<b>If the rest of you don't harden up,</b>

19:10.210 --> 19:13.590
<b>I don't think you'll survive much longer.</b>

19:14.500 --> 19:18.340
<b><i>So she said that out of concern for us.</i></b>

19:21.760 --> 19:22.890
<b>Well...</b>

19:24.680 --> 19:26.810
<b>You're pretty soft yourself, Chelsea.</b>

19:29.810 --> 19:31.190
<b>Not at all.</b>

19:31.190 --> 19:34.020
<b>I just do what I need to stay sane.</b>

19:34.020 --> 19:34.770
<b>Ah.</b>

19:34.770 --> 19:38.030
<b>Also, if you ever peep on me again,</b>

19:38.820 --> 19:41.240
<b>I'll chop it off. Keep that in mind.{"I'll cut it off." "I'll rip it off." "I'll smash it."}{hah}</b>

19:42.820 --> 19:47.290
<b>Ch-Chop it off? Chop <i>what</i> off?!</b>

19:57.840 --> 19:58.380
<b>Captain?</b>

20:00.220 --> 20:01.760
<b>Is something the matter?</b>

20:02.760 --> 20:06.390
<b>Whenever I'm somewhere with a lot of people, 
I always end up looking for Tatsumi.</b>

20:07.260 --> 20:08.600
<b>Captain...</b>

20:08.600 --> 20:14.150
<b>We found a number of people
in the army who resemble him.</b>

20:14.690 --> 20:17.270
<b>If you'd like, we can arrange for you to meet them.</b>

20:18.070 --> 20:20.440
<b>That won't be necessary, Run.</b>

20:21.280 --> 20:23.450
<b>There is only one Tatsumi in this world.</b>

20:24.070 --> 20:25.910
<b>I will accept no substitutes.</b>

20:26.660 --> 20:28.030
<b>My apologies.</b>

20:30.250 --> 20:31.910
<b><i>This isn't good.</i></b>

20:32.460 --> 20:35.040
<b><i>A highly sadistic woman in league with the prime minister.</i></b>

20:35.580 --> 20:39.500
<b><i>Even if she was as powerful as they said, 
I figured she'd be scum all the same.</i></b>

20:39.840 --> 20:44.090
<b><i>But I guess it might be fun 
to keep an eye on her for a while.</i></b>

20:47.550 --> 20:49.770
<b><i>What is this feeling in my chest?</i></b>

20:49.770 --> 20:52.020
<b><i>Am I going to be reunited with Tatsumi soon?</i></b>

20:54.060 --> 20:55.310
<b><i>Or...</i></b>

20:57.190 --> 21:00.150
<b><i>Does our final battle with them approach?</i></b>

21:05.740 --> 21:08.620
<b><i>Or is it something else entirely?</i></b>

21:26.720 --> 21:28.510
<b>It's a Danger Beast I've never seen before!</b>

21:28.510 --> 21:30.350
<b>Run!</b>

21:44.030 --> 21:48.490
<b><i>Looks like I've acquired some rather amusing toys.</i></b>

21:49.490 --> 21:51.620
<b><i>It's been ages since I last visited the capital.</i></b>

21:51.620 --> 21:53.790
<b><i>I'll be sure to make the most of it.</i></b>

21:53.790 --> 21:55.790

Please don't hold me back

So just break me already

22:50.620 --> 22:55.930

23:01.400 --> 23:11.710
Of the weaknesses I've never shown anyone, one has come tumbling out
