00:12.780 --> 00:14.240
<b>Don't be so self-absorbed.</b>

00:16.240 --> 00:21.000
<b>We needed to stop the public execution to 
maintain the Revolutionary Army's morale.</b>

00:21.750 --> 00:23.960
<b>We were all prepared for what could happen.</b>

00:24.460 --> 00:26.170
<b>But still...</b>

00:27.210 --> 00:33.090
<b>Also, we were able to eliminate Budo, 
who's been a thorn in our side for years.</b>

00:33.090 --> 00:34.840
<b>Our gains outweigh our losses.</b>

00:34.840 --> 00:36.680
<b>How can you say that?</b>

00:36.680 --> 00:39.350
<b>Tatsumi, it's not like the boss isn't hurting too.</b>

00:39.850 --> 00:41.560
<b>She lost Susanoo, after all.</b>

00:42.390 --> 00:43.770
<b>Don't worry about that.</b>

<b>Su...{lubbock? who's that}</b>

00:50.150 --> 00:55.360
<b>As the survivors, we carry the hopes of those who've passed away on our shoulders.</b>

00:55.360 --> 00:56.910
<b>That's far too heavy a burden.</b>

00:57.530 --> 00:58.700
<b>It is.</b>

00:58.700 --> 01:02.120
<b>But it's not one that we can abandon lightly.</b>

<b>If we throw in the towel here,

01:09.460 --> 01:10.880
<b>You're right.</b>

01:12.210 --> 01:15.090
<b>We have to put an end to the suffering.</b>

01:24.850 --> 01:28.900

<b>I've long hoped for revolution.{allow me to arbitrarily reveal to you my secret plans}</b>

<b>Change the nation?</b>

04:39.670 --> 04:42.010
<b>This empire is rotten to the core.</b>

<b>However, it would have been foolish to openly rebel like those out there.</b>

04:45.380 --> 04:48.050

<b>Your attitude and behavior gave it away.</b>

<b>If you escape now, you won't have to worry about them coming after you.</b>

05:27.970 --> 05:29.550
<b>You can be free.</b>

05:30.140 --> 05:31.680
<b>Free...</b>

<b>That's right.</b>

<b>A taste of freedom isn't what I desire.</b>

05:36.730 --> 05:39.440

<b>Truly, this is how a battle should be.</b>

<b><i>I knew that we were destined for each other.</i></b>

06:24.940 --> 06:26.530
<b><i>Wait for me.</i></b>

06:26.530 --> 06:29.530

06:42.840 --> 06:43.960
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

06:44.920 --> 06:48.510
<b>Will this nation fall on my account?</b>

06:49.470 --> 06:51.180
<b>Have I followed the wrong path?</b>

06:51.180 --> 06:54.600
<b>Not at all, Your Majesty.</b>

06:54.600 --> 06:55.930
<b>H-Honest...</b>

06:56.560 --> 06:58.890
<b>Not one person here can be depended on.</b>

06:59.890 --> 07:01.770
<b>Everyone is far too flustered.</b>

07:02.730 --> 07:07.530
<b>I am painfully aware of how you are feeling, Your Majesty.</b>

07:07.530 --> 07:09.780
<b>The citizens are being foolish.</b>

07:09.780 --> 07:14.830
<b>They don't understand what it's like

07:14.830 --> 07:17.620
<b>I can't believe my people would rebel.</b>

07:17.620 --> 07:18.910
<b>What am I supposed to do?</b>

07:19.830 --> 07:24.170
<b>Your Majesty, at times, an emperor must be firm.</b>

07:24.790 --> 07:28.550
<b>Now is the time to demonstrate your authority.</b>

07:29.050 --> 07:30.550

<b><i>The emperor's true power...</i></b>

07:41.940 --> 07:44.190

07:44.860 --> 07:45.400
<b>So...</b>

07:46.440 --> 07:49.320
<b>Let's settle this once and for all, Sis.</b>

07:51.320 --> 07:53.360
<b>They say these were Revolutionary Army spies.</b>

07:53.740 --> 07:55.570
<b>Is this meant as a warning?</b>

07:55.570 --> 07:56.950
<b>How cruel.</b>

08:00.960 --> 08:02.420
<b>It's a code.</b>

08:03.460 --> 08:04.460
<b>A code?</b>

08:05.040 --> 08:06.920
<b>A message for me.</b>

08:07.630 --> 08:08.380
<b>What was that?</b>

08:09.590 --> 08:12.800
<b>"I will be waiting for you 
near the Kadai Forest facility."</b>

08:12.800 --> 08:15.180
<b>Don't be stupid. You know it's a trap!</b>

08:15.930 --> 08:18.810
<b>The empire would have no reason to single me out at this point.</b>

08:19.430 --> 08:20.850
<b>This is a personal challenge.</b>

08:21.310 --> 08:23.100
<b>A personal challenge? From whom?</b>

08:24.310 --> 08:26.360
<b>Kurome wants to settle things for good.</b>

08:28.070 --> 08:32.150
<b>Is it important that you two see this through?</b>

08:33.700 --> 08:37.870
<b>Even considering how many people are pinning their hopes on us?</b>

08:37.870 --> 08:40.410
<b>Do you really have to do this?</b>

08:40.910 --> 08:42.830
<b>That's even more reason to.{i have no idea why but ok}</b>

08:43.370 --> 08:46.920
<b>I have to respect Kurome's wishes.</b>

08:46.920 --> 08:48.540
<b>Even if she's the enemy?</b>

08:48.540 --> 08:49.630
<b>She's my sister.</b>

08:51.260 --> 08:55.630
<b>I'm the only one who can understand and accept her wishes.</b>

08:58.510 --> 09:01.310
<b>I understand. I'm coming with you.</b>

09:01.310 --> 09:02.480
<b>No, you're not.</b>

09:02.480 --> 09:05.600
<b>We'll need your strength in the final battle.</b>

09:06.230 --> 09:07.560
<b>You must fulfill your mission.</b>

09:07.560 --> 09:08.150
<b>Then...</b>

09:08.150 --> 09:10.440
<b>Promise me you'll come back alive!</b>

09:11.650 --> 09:13.110
<b>Tatsumi...</b>

09:13.110 --> 09:15.150
<b>That's what you've always asked me, right?</b>

09:15.530 --> 09:17.030
<b>The least you can do is promise me the same!</b>

09:19.240 --> 09:20.240
<b>Okay.</b>

09:21.540 --> 09:22.540
<b>It's a promise.</b>

09:53.440 --> 09:56.740
<b>I knew you wouldn't let me down, Sis.</b>

09:59.740 --> 10:01.080
<b>Kurome...</b>

10:02.790 --> 10:03.790
<b>Would you like some?</b>

10:16.800 --> 10:20.220
<b>This is where we were once reunited.</b>

10:21.140 --> 10:25.180
<b>And this is also the place where you betrayed us.</b>

10:26.310 --> 10:29.810
<b>I can't think of a more fitting place for me to kill you.</b>

10:30.480 --> 10:32.060
<b>This takes me back.</b>

10:32.980 --> 10:36.190
<b>You were always the one who protected me.</b>

10:37.650 --> 10:42.580
<b>As orphans, we had no other home but here.</b>

10:44.080 --> 10:46.620
<b>Raised as assassins for the empire,</b>

10:47.080 --> 10:52.330
<b>our purpose in life was to maintain public order by eliminating any potential insurgency.</b>

10:52.330 --> 10:54.920
<b>That is what we were told and how we were raised.</b>

10:56.090 --> 10:58.130
<b>We obeyed our orders,</b>

10:58.130 --> 11:00.720
<b>killing those who had wronged the empire,</b>

11:03.720 --> 11:06.680
<b>because we believed it was the right thing to do.</b>

11:09.230 --> 11:10.850

<b>Kurome.</b>

<b>Sis...</b>

11:18.150 --> 11:23.280
<b>After being trained in separate divisions, 
we were finally reunited—</b>

11:23.990 --> 11:26.740
<b>simply because we were needed to replace fallen comrades.</b>

11:29.120 --> 11:32.370
<b>We were inseparable after that.</b>

11:32.370 --> 11:35.130
<b>It was as if we were reliving our childhood.</b>

11:35.920 --> 11:39.050
<b>We were the most skilled assassination unit the empire had known.</b>

11:39.550 --> 11:41.880
<b>Some missions were difficult,</b>

11:41.880 --> 11:44.090
<b>but we were able to rely on each other and pull through.</b>

11:44.090 --> 11:47.470
<b>As long as I was with you, I was happy.</b>

11:47.470 --> 11:48.600
<b>But you...</b>

11:49.390 --> 11:50.350
<b>But you...</b>

11:51.190 --> 11:52.190
<b>But you...</b>

11:56.690 --> 12:00.360
<b>You betrayed the empire and joined Night Raid!</b>

12:00.950 --> 12:02.200
<b>Why?</b>

12:02.200 --> 12:03.860
<b>I tried to stop you.</b>

12:08.290 --> 12:12.000
<b>After you left me, I was miserable.</b>

12:12.000 --> 12:13.790
<b>I thought about you every day.</b>

12:13.790 --> 12:15.750
<b>About how I was going to kill you.</b>

12:16.540 --> 12:18.340
<b>If you do, will you find peace?</b>

12:18.710 --> 12:20.710
<b>I will never know peace.</b>

12:20.710 --> 12:22.050
<b>I just want to be the one to do it.</b>

12:22.760 --> 12:25.890
<b>So that you'll belong to me.</b>

12:29.310 --> 12:32.560
<b>Using your Imperial Relic takes an enormous amount of energy.</b>

12:32.980 --> 12:35.100
<b>It must be agonizing in your condition.</b>

12:35.650 --> 12:36.810
<b>I'll make the pain go away.</b>

12:38.770 --> 12:40.440
<b>Let's kill each other,</b>

<b>Sis.{end of part a}</b>

12:43.110 --> 12:45.990
Kurome's

12:43.110 --> 12:45.990
Snacks

12:44.610 --> 12:45.990
<b>Kurome...</b>

12:47.160 --> 12:49.240
<b>She went out, didn't she?</b>

12:49.910 --> 12:52.500
<b>To settle everything for herself.</b>

12:53.370 --> 12:56.420
<b>Why would she do that without telling us?</b>

12:56.420 --> 12:58.790
<b>Because you would have stopped her.</b>

13:01.300 --> 13:03.670
<b>Do you have any idea where she'd go?</b>

13:03.670 --> 13:05.720
<b>Maybe a place that's special to them?</b>

13:28.200 --> 13:30.580
<b>Why did you betray our squad?</b>

13:30.580 --> 13:33.620
<b>We could've stayed together!</b>

13:33.620 --> 13:38.130
<b>I started to realize that what we were doing wasn't to keep the peace.</b>

13:38.130 --> 13:39.000
<b>It was all a lie!</b>

13:40.000 --> 13:45.300
<b>We were a special unit that executed missions from the capital, no matter what they were.</b>

13:45.300 --> 13:49.350
<b>If the current empire continues to exist, the citizens are doomed to suffer.</b>

13:49.350 --> 13:51.640
<b>That's why I tried to get you to escape with me.</b>

13:51.640 --> 13:53.350
<b>I couldn't just run away.</b>

13:53.350 --> 13:56.520
<b>Our comrades gave their lives for our cause! 
How could I betray them?</b>

13:56.520 --> 13:59.190
<b>The rulers of the empire are the source of all this misery.</b>

13:59.190 --> 14:02.020
<b>If eliminating them will help the citizens,</b>

14:02.020 --> 14:03.860
<b>I'm sure our fallen comrades would understand.</b>

14:03.860 --> 14:05.440
<b>You don't get to decide that, Sis!</b>

14:21.960 --> 14:23.420
<b>A Danger Beast?</b>

14:23.420 --> 14:24.960
<b>An experimental subject entombed here.</b>

14:25.340 --> 14:27.970
<b>Our battle must have awakened it.</b>

<b>Natala!</b>

<b>Doya!{that wasn't very clever at all}</b>

<b>Doya too...</b>

<b>I'll never accept you into my collection!</b>

15:06.840 --> 15:08.800
<b>Are you all right, Kurome?</b>

15:09.430 --> 15:10.380
<b>Sis...</b>

15:13.390 --> 15:13.890
<b>Let's do it.</b>

15:34.950 --> 15:36.080
<b>Eliminate!</b>

15:48.130 --> 15:50.590
<b>We haven't lost our touch, have we?</b>

15:51.220 --> 15:54.800
<b>Nothing can stop us when we're together.</b>

15:54.800 --> 15:56.760
<b>Isn't that right, Sis?</b>

16:07.570 --> 16:08.690
<b>Come forth!</b>

16:22.750 --> 16:25.460
<b>So a few no-name puppets won't do, huh?</b>

16:25.460 --> 16:27.880
<b>This is the end!</b>

<b>I won't let you hurt Kurome.</b>

<b>I'll take you on!</b>

<b>Tatsumi?</b>

16:46.230 --> 16:47.480
<b>Get out of the way, Tatsumi!</b>

16:47.480 --> 16:49.110
<b>Don't interrupt us!</b>

16:49.900 --> 16:53.650
<b>Kurome, I can't just abandon one of my comrades.</b>

16:53.650 --> 16:55.240
<b>This isn't what I wanted.</b>

16:55.990 --> 16:57.200
<b>Kurome...</b>

16:57.200 --> 16:59.410
<b>Tatsumi, why are you here?</b>

16:59.410 --> 17:02.000
<b>To make sure no one interferes with your duel.</b>

17:05.040 --> 17:07.540
<b>Tatsumi, I don't have time to deal with—</b>

17:07.540 --> 17:09.040
<b>I want to stop them too!</b>

17:09.040 --> 17:12.170
<b>But if I do, they'll never overcome their past!</b>

17:12.170 --> 17:15.260
<b>Is that what you've learned from Night Raid?</b>

17:15.260 --> 17:17.550
<b>I can't allow this battle to occur!</b>

17:17.550 --> 17:19.560
<b>Everyone has their own reasons to fight!</b>

17:19.560 --> 17:24.140
<b>Sometimes, you have to settle it yourself 
or there's no way forward!</b>

17:28.860 --> 17:30.770
<b>Their own reasons to fight...</b>

<b>Thank you for coming.</b>

17:49.670 --> 17:53.130
<b>I wish we could've gotten closer under different circumstances.</b>

17:57.050 --> 17:58.180
<b>Kurome...</b>

17:58.680 --> 18:02.560
<b>I have to sort out my regrets from back then.</b>

18:03.770 --> 18:05.770
<b>So that I can finally move on.</b>

18:06.560 --> 18:08.400
<b>Let's do this, Sis.</b>

18:17.950 --> 18:20.870
<b>Kurome... My little sister...</b>

18:22.580 --> 18:26.500
<b>Yeah. I love you, Sis.</b>

19:17.960 --> 19:20.930
<b>Was there no other way?{passionate yuri incest hatesex}</b>

19:24.640 --> 19:28.310
<b>I couldn't do anything for Kurome.</b>

19:29.480 --> 19:32.020
<b>You came here for her.</b>

19:33.110 --> 19:34.310
<b>That's plenty.</b>

<b>Damn it.</b>

<b>I told you not to come after me.</b>

20:31.500 --> 20:33.000
<b>I didn't come to fight.</b>
