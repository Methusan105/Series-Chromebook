<b>Master, it's time for your massage.</b>

00:22.830 --> 00:23.580
<b>Oh!</b>

00:24.080 --> 00:27.920
<b>Today, I'd like the refreshing, full-body rub-down.</b>

00:32.550 --> 00:34.300
<b>All done.</b>

00:34.300 --> 00:36.300
<b>What the hell kind of massage is that, anyway?</b>

00:37.720 --> 00:39.100
<b>We're with the Jaegers!</b>

00:39.100 --> 00:42.390
<b>We've received word that you may be in danger, so we'll need to secure this room.</b>

<b>Wave.</b>

00:45.140 --> 00:46.900
<b>We were too late.</b>

00:46.900 --> 00:53.190
<b>So our plans got leaked somehow, 
and I almost ran into the Jaegers.</b>

00:53.190 --> 00:55.240
<b>And you still got out in one piece.</b>

00:55.240 --> 00:56.610

00:57.320 --> 00:58.700
<b>He owned a few cats,</b>

00:58.700 --> 01:01.790
<b>so I transformed into one and snuck out.</b>

01:02.580 --> 01:05.960
<b>That would have posed a problem for me.</b>

01:05.960 --> 01:08.290
<b>I hate to admit it,

01:08.290 --> 01:11.590
<b>It can get tough when you're as well-known as you are.</b>

<b>I won't stand for this!</b>

01:27.690 --> 01:30.520
<b>You were perfectly okay saying it to me, though.</b>

01:31.020 --> 01:32.730
<b>Judging from this incident,</b>

01:32.730 --> 01:35.360

<b>All the new Danger Beasts have been exterminated,</b>

<b>Hey, Seryu!</b>

<b>Wait.</b>

<b>You killed those bandits, didn't you?</b>

05:47.700 --> 05:50.490
<b>As Jaegers, we may have special authority,</b>

<b>but there are things we can and can't do—</b>

<b><i>but the capital's even worse than I thought.</i></b>

<b><i>To produce someone so twisted...</i></b>

06:17.520 --> 06:20.230
<b><i>Nonetheless, I must repay my debt.</i></b>

06:21.440 --> 06:24.980
<b><i>I'm simply going to carry out my duties as a soldier.</i></b>

06:26.280 --> 06:28.570
<b>The time has come for the 
Revolutionary Army to rise.</b>

06:28.990 --> 06:33.580
<b>And so, I'll explain the first mission we've been assigned.</b>

06:34.450 --> 06:38.750
<b>Have you all heard about Path of Peace, the religious group gaining popularity among the people?</b>

06:38.750 --> 06:43.250
<b>The one that believes good deeds 
contribute to happiness and longevity?</b>

06:43.670 --> 06:46.260
<b>Oh, I know them! They even came to my village!</b>

06:46.840 --> 06:51.760
<b>The icon that my chief gave me 
was from that religion.</b>

06:52.260 --> 06:55.140
<b>Over the past decade, Path of Peace has gained many followers,</b>

06:55.140 --> 06:57.770
<b>and they've become highly influential in the empire's east.</b>

06:58.180 --> 07:01.150
<b>Soon they will cause an armed uprising.</b>

07:01.150 --> 07:03.150
<b>In other words, they'll ignite a religious insurrection.</b>

07:04.440 --> 07:07.400
<b>We shall use this to our advantage.</b>

07:07.990 --> 07:09.820
<b>W-Wait a second!</b>

07:09.820 --> 07:12.910
<b>If an uprising like that takes place, how many people will die?</b>

07:13.450 --> 07:15.830
<b>In fact, shouldn't we be trying to prevent it?</b>

07:15.830 --> 07:19.580
<b>The corrupt government has already 
pushed the citizens close to breaking point.</b>

07:20.920 --> 07:23.500
<b>Even if we prevent Path of Peace's insurrection,</b>

07:23.500 --> 07:26.210
<b>the populace remains a powder keg liable to explode at any time.</b>

07:26.800 --> 07:30.420
<b>This nation already teeters on the brink of anarchy.</b>

07:31.260 --> 07:32.220
<b>I see.</b>

07:34.930 --> 07:37.890
<b>Let's at least hear out the mission.</b>

07:37.890 --> 07:42.230
<b>Remember when I told you about the insurrection in the southwest? Or the hero of the North?</b>

07:44.060 --> 07:46.570
<b>They were both subjugated by Esdeath, weren't they?</b>

07:46.900 --> 07:51.200
<b>Their flaw was that they tried to rebel against the empire on their own.</b>

07:51.570 --> 07:54.120
<b>The empire is still incredibly strong.</b>

07:54.120 --> 07:57.830
<b>Alone, Path of Peace's revolt 
would be suppressed eventually,</b>

07:57.830 --> 07:59.700
<b>but not without considerable bloodshed.</b>

08:01.750 --> 08:04.080
<b>That's why it's finally time for the Revolutionary Army to step in.</b>

08:04.830 --> 08:07.630
<b>The moment Path of Peace 
begins their armed uprising,</b>

08:07.630 --> 08:11.260
<b>one of the western races with whom we are allied will begin an invasion.</b>

08:11.630 --> 08:15.760
<b>That way, the empire will have to 
fend off enemies from both inside and out.</b>

08:16.550 --> 08:18.850
<b>But even then, they can probably tough it out.</b>

08:19.430 --> 08:21.180
<b>So, to deliver the final blow,</b>

08:21.180 --> 08:23.850
<b>the Revolutionary Army will launch their rebellion from the south.</b>

08:24.350 --> 08:26.310
<b>They'll advance toward the capital,</b>

08:26.310 --> 08:28.270
<b>and they'll overthrow it.</b>

08:28.270 --> 08:29.730
<b>Now I see.</b>

08:29.730 --> 08:31.240
<b>A three-pronged attack, huh?</b>

08:31.610 --> 08:34.490
<b>The empire underestimates the Revolutionary Army.</b>

08:34.490 --> 08:39.040
<b>You could even say they appreciate them for gathering rebellious elements in one location.</b>

08:39.410 --> 08:42.200
<b>The Army are based at the southern border.</b>

08:42.200 --> 08:44.210
<b>In order to get to the capital,</b>

08:44.210 --> 08:47.290
<b>they'll have to break through several forts and castles.</b>

08:47.710 --> 08:52.260
<b>However, we've arranged for a number 
of castle viceroys to defect to our side.</b>

08:52.260 --> 08:56.340
<b>Since so many were demoted simply for taking their jobs seriously,</b>

08:57.010 --> 08:59.260
<b>they were easy to win over.</b>

08:59.260 --> 09:03.230
<b>The Army will advance at daunting speed 
toward the surprised capital</b>

09:03.230 --> 09:06.270
<b>while the empire's fortifications 
bloodlessly surrender in their path.</b>

09:06.900 --> 09:10.650
<b>The capital is sure to send their trump card, 
Commander-in-Chief Budo,</b>

09:10.650 --> 09:13.240
<b>to meet them with his soldiers.</b>

09:13.240 --> 09:16.820
<b>But this will mean the security of the palace will be gravely compromised.</b>

09:16.820 --> 09:19.950
<b>That gives us the perfect opportunity to assassinate the prime minister.</b>

09:21.160 --> 09:25.080
<b>We'll invade the palace and eliminate him.</b>

09:26.170 --> 09:27.920
<b>We'll bring down the empire from the inside.</b>

09:27.920 --> 09:31.960
<b>He's just the kind of sneaky bastard who'd get away in the end, though.</b>

09:31.960 --> 09:33.420
<b>I won't let that happen.</b>

09:33.420 --> 09:35.010
<b>He's the ringleader.</b>

09:35.010 --> 09:37.300
<b>He needs to die.</b>

09:37.760 --> 09:43.850
<b>In exchange for their assistance, we've agreed to return the western race's ancestral land.</b>

09:43.850 --> 09:44.520
<b>Return?</b>

09:45.060 --> 09:49.900
<b>The western part of the empire originally belonged to them.</b>

09:50.980 --> 09:53.360
<b>Having that land returned is their greatest wish.</b>

09:54.190 --> 09:55.860
<b><i>Oh, that's right.</i></b>

09:55.860 --> 09:58.280
<b><i>Mine is partly descended from the western race.</i></b>

09:58.280 --> 10:02.790
<b>If the capital collapses, and the corruption with it, the citizens' rage will be defused.</b>

10:03.290 --> 10:08.290
<b>As long as we move swiftly forward with our plans, bloodshed should be minimal.</b>

10:09.170 --> 10:11.460
<b>Does that satisfy you, Tatsumi?</b>

10:11.460 --> 10:12.460
<b>Yeah.</b>

10:12.460 --> 10:13.800
<b>Sorry for interrupting.</b>

10:14.170 --> 10:19.300
<b>However, Path of Peace, the cornerstone of our plan, 
is currently on shaky ground.</b>

10:20.800 --> 10:24.720
<b>Lord! Lord! Lord!</b>

10:24.720 --> 10:27.390
<b>The religion's founder is intensely charismatic.</b>

10:27.390 --> 10:32.310
<b>But it turns out that his advisor, Bolic, 
is actually a spy sent by the prime minister.</b>

10:32.690 --> 10:38.780
<b>His mission is to seize leadership of the group 
and quell the armed uprising.</b>

10:38.780 --> 10:40.530
<b>Here's our assignment.</b>

10:40.910 --> 10:44.870
<b>We are to travel to the Path of Peace headquarters and take down Bolic.</b>

10:44.870 --> 10:52.750
<b>He's a villain who laces his followers' food 
with drugs, turning them into his puppets.</b>

10:52.750 --> 10:53.880
<b>No need to hold back.</b>

10:54.710 --> 10:57.630
<b>He probably has his way with 
every girl he can lay his hands on.</b>

10:58.090 --> 11:01.510
<b>Cooking with drugs is a crime against food!</b>

11:01.510 --> 11:03.010
<b>He's going down, no matter what!</b>

11:03.850 --> 11:06.970
<b>Aren't your priorities a little skewed, you two?</b>

11:06.970 --> 11:10.480
<b>If left alone, he'll drug more and more people.</b>

11:11.150 --> 11:13.150
<b>We have to stop him, and soon.</b>

11:13.150 --> 11:15.610
<b>Finally, regarding the Jaegers...</b>

11:15.610 --> 11:19.990
<b>As long as Esdeath leads them, they belong to the prime minister's private army.</b>

11:20.400 --> 11:23.570
<b>That said, in order for our plan to go smoothly,</b>

11:23.570 --> 11:25.830
<b>it would be best to deal with them first.</b>

11:25.830 --> 11:29.620
<b>At this point, they're fully focused on hunting us down.</b>

11:29.620 --> 11:31.870
<b>That means we can lure them outside the capital,</b>

11:32.290 --> 11:33.710
<b>which is where <i>we'll</i> attack.</b>

11:33.710 --> 11:35.960
<b>So it's finally time for the decisive battle!</b>

11:37.500 --> 11:42.720
<b>HQ has specifically requested that we eliminate Kurome and Bols if given the chance.</b>

11:43.470 --> 11:46.470
<b>I trust the time you spent with them won't dull your blade, Tatsumi.</b>

11:47.510 --> 11:49.270
<b><i>Wave was a good guy,</i></b>

11:49.270 --> 11:51.020
<b><i>and he wasn't specified as a target.</i></b>

11:51.020 --> 11:52.350
<b><i>There's no reason to fight him.</i></b>

11:52.900 --> 11:57.780
<b><i>But he'll still give his all to defend his comrades.</i></b>

11:57.780 --> 11:59.780
<b><i>He isn't someone I can take lightly.</i></b>

12:00.240 --> 12:02.820
<b><i>And above all, I'm a killer.</i></b>

12:02.820 --> 12:04.620
<b><i>I chose this path myself,</i></b>

12:04.620 --> 12:06.700
<b><i>knowing full well what might await me.</i></b>

12:08.120 --> 12:08.990
<b>I can do it.</b>

12:09.500 --> 12:12.750
<b>I'll give it all I have, 
whether they're our targets or not!</b>

12:12.750 --> 12:13.750
<b>I will not waver!</b>

12:18.380 --> 12:19.210
<b>Good.</b>

12:19.630 --> 12:20.920
<b><i>I like that look in his eyes.</i></b>

12:20.920 --> 12:22.630
<b><i>I can feel his resolve.</i></b>

12:22.630 --> 12:26.930
<b><i>Looks like we won't have to worry about losing anyone due to sympathy for the enemy.</i></b>

12:27.430 --> 12:29.060
<b><i>Wait...</i></b>

12:29.430 --> 12:32.730
<b><i>Why am I looking at Tatsumi like this?</i></b>

12:34.350 --> 12:37.360
<b>Trying to act cool again, huh? 
Better check your fly this time!</b>

12:35.850 --> 12:38.270
<b><i>It seems I just can't ignore him...</i></b>

12:37.360 --> 12:38.730
<b>I already did!</b>

12:47.530 --> 12:48.450
<b>Captain.</b>

12:49.370 --> 12:52.540
<b>We've received word that 
Akame and Mine of Night Raid</b>

12:52.540 --> 12:55.790
<b>were spotted near the 
eastern side of Romary Street.</b>

13:00.710 --> 13:03.130
<b>Assemble the Jaegers.</b>

13:04.840 --> 13:07.430
<b><i>Just as humans eventually rot away,</i></b>

13:07.430 --> 13:09.850
<b><i>nations also decay and collapse.</i></b>

13:09.850 --> 13:12.430
<b><i>Those who seek the birth of a new nation,</i></b>

13:13.270 --> 13:15.690
<b><i>and those who seek to defend the nation they have...</i></b>

13:16.230 --> 13:21.110
<b><i>With their differing ideologies, principles, and goals,</i></b>

13:21.110 --> 13:24.820
<b><i>their inescapable destinies are on a collision course.</i></b>

13:25.570 --> 13:28.490
<b><i>Arming themselves with their deadly weapons</i></b>

13:28.490 --> 13:30.780
<b><i>and carrying their determination in their hearts,</i></b>

13:31.660 --> 13:33.450
<b><i>they close in on their ultimate battle.{end of part a}</i></b>

13:46.970 --> 13:48.300
<b>It's the Jaegers!</b>

13:48.300 --> 13:49.930
<b>All six are headed east!</b>

13:49.930 --> 13:52.850
<b>It's all going according to Najenda's plan!</b>

13:53.560 --> 13:55.180
<b>I'm counting on you, margue falcon.</b>

13:55.180 --> 13:56.940
<b>Take this message to Night Raid!</b>

13:59.310 --> 14:03.320
<b><i>Assassinating a religious leader 
and doing battle against the Jaegers...</i></b>

14:03.320 --> 14:06.150
<b><i>Regardless of their manpower, 
it's a treacherous mission. {lit. no amount of lives would be enough for this mission}</i></b>

14:06.610 --> 14:09.070
<b><i>But you must survive, Night Raid!</i></b>

14:09.070 --> 14:13.450
<b><i>We need your power to cleanse this depraved world.</i></b>

14:14.950 --> 14:16.620
<b>Six, huh?</b>

14:16.620 --> 14:19.380
<b>So all the Jaegers are on the move.</b>

14:20.130 --> 14:22.710
<b>Judging by Esdeath's speed,</b>

14:22.710 --> 14:26.050
<b>the soonest they could arrive is past noon tomorrow,</b>

14:26.050 --> 14:28.380
<b>even if they head straight for our location.</b>

14:31.510 --> 14:32.180
<b>All right.</b>

14:33.890 --> 14:36.430
<b>That was a message from 
the Revolutionary Army's spies.</b>

14:36.810 --> 14:40.850
<b>You two are to attract attention as we planned.</b>

14:40.850 --> 14:41.690
<b>Roger that.</b>

14:44.610 --> 14:46.030
<b>Wow.</b>

14:46.400 --> 14:50.160
<b>It sure is nice to be able to stare at girls in swimsuits on the job!</b>

14:50.160 --> 14:51.700
<b>Stop drooling.</b>

14:51.700 --> 14:53.830
<b>You know this is just part of our operation, right?</b>

14:53.830 --> 14:55.410
<b>What is wrong with you?</b>

14:55.410 --> 14:56.370
<b>Are you gay?</b>

14:56.370 --> 14:57.160
<b>No way!</b>

14:57.160 --> 14:58.660
<b>Tatsumi...</b>

14:58.660 --> 15:02.790
<b>Tatsumi, whose bikini do you prefer: 
Chelsea's or mine?{Chelsea （　´‿ゝ`）}{Yes, Mine's}</b>

15:02.790 --> 15:04.800
<b>Oh, I'd like to hear that myself.</b>

15:05.380 --> 15:06.630
<b>So?</b>

15:06.630 --> 15:08.130
<b>Which is it?</b>

15:08.130 --> 15:10.380
<b>Uh... I, well...</b>

15:10.800 --> 15:14.300
<b>Wow, Su, you sure are buff!{yep, gay}</b>

15:14.300 --> 15:16.220
<b>Oh, well. Lost him.</b>

15:16.220 --> 15:17.930
<b>If you'd just ask me,</b>

15:17.930 --> 15:20.440
<b>I'd be happy to answer that I love them both equally!</b>

15:20.440 --> 15:23.110
<b>Then I'd dive into your breasts and sing the national anthem!</b>

15:23.110 --> 15:24.520
<b>So why ask Tatsumi?!</b>

15:24.520 --> 15:27.280
<b>You answered your own question.</b>

15:27.820 --> 15:29.900
<b>Exactly. Guys like you are no fun.</b>

15:29.900 --> 15:31.410
<b>Why?</b>

15:31.410 --> 15:32.990
<b>Why Tatsumi and not me?</b>

15:32.990 --> 15:34.160
<b>I don't understand!</b>

15:34.160 --> 15:35.870
<b>And you never will!</b>

15:35.870 --> 15:39.660
<b>Team Incognito look like 
they're having fun down there.</b>

15:40.210 --> 15:44.040
<b>Damn, I wish I wasn't so well-known! That should be me!</b>

15:45.000 --> 15:47.170
<b>What's wrong, Akame?</b>

15:47.170 --> 15:48.760
<b>Oh, nothing.</b>

15:52.380 --> 15:54.890
<b>You're thinking about your sister, aren't you?</b>

15:59.220 --> 16:00.100
<b>Yeah.</b>

16:02.560 --> 16:05.770
<b>She has orders to kill me, after all.</b>

16:05.770 --> 16:08.030
<b>I can't help but think about what might happen.</b>

16:16.370 --> 16:18.160
<b>Even if your sister dies,</b>

16:18.160 --> 16:21.750
<b>don't you dare say you're alone.</b>

16:23.210 --> 16:26.380
<b>You have us. You'd better be thankful!</b>

16:29.510 --> 16:30.260
<b>Yeah.</b>

16:31.880 --> 16:33.840
<b>Najenda is continuing east.</b>

16:34.130 --> 16:35.680
<b>Akame is headed south.</b>

16:36.220 --> 16:41.270
<b>This town is where they were seen splitting into two groups.</b>

16:37.640 --> 16:41.270
<b>No, this is mine! I'll give you some meat later!</b>

16:41.270 --> 16:45.310
<b>If we go east, we'll end up in Kyoroch, 
the Path of Peace's headquarters.</b>

16:45.310 --> 16:49.270
<b>If we go south, we'll run into cities sympathetic to the rebels.</b>

16:49.270 --> 16:51.280
<b>Their activity is suspicious either way.</b>

16:51.280 --> 16:53.740
<b>If we hurry, we can catch up to them.</b>

16:53.740 --> 16:54.280
<b>Let's go.</b>

16:54.660 --> 16:56.320
<b>Hold on.</b>

16:56.320 --> 16:58.870
<b>Night Raid are enemies of the state.</b>

16:58.870 --> 17:01.790
<b>The wanted posters haven't been circulated this far out yet,</b>

17:01.790 --> 17:04.790
<b>so they lowered their guard, 
and that's how they were sighted.</b>

17:04.790 --> 17:08.170
<b>They were even seen splitting up.</b>

17:08.500 --> 17:10.250
<b>Isn't it a little too convenient?</b>

17:10.250 --> 17:11.090
<b>I agree.</b>

17:11.090 --> 17:12.800
<b>It's very likely to be a trap.</b>

17:13.380 --> 17:15.340
<b>Perhaps they wanted to be seen.</b>

17:15.340 --> 17:18.050
<b>Do they want to lure us 
from the capital and defeat us?</b>

17:19.140 --> 17:21.390
<b>That's exactly what Najenda would do.</b>

17:21.390 --> 17:24.060
<b>She fights calmly, 
but her heart burns with fervor.</b>

17:24.060 --> 17:26.100
<b>Which means following them will be dangerous.</b>

17:26.100 --> 17:28.480
<b>No, we can't let this chance pass us by.</b>

17:28.480 --> 17:31.530
<b>Night Raid's been careful to 
conceal themselves all this time,</b>

17:31.530 --> 17:34.030
<b>but now, they're practically showing off in front of us.</b>

17:34.030 --> 17:35.900
<b>Not only will we be prepared for the trap,</b>

17:35.900 --> 17:37.360
<b>but we will crush them utterly.</b>

17:37.700 --> 17:40.530
<b>Seryu, Run, and I will pursue Najenda.</b>

17:40.530 --> 17:42.700
<b>Kurome, Wave, and Bols will go after Akame.</b>

17:44.620 --> 17:47.000
<b>Be aware of your surroundings at all times.</b>

17:47.000 --> 17:51.380
<b>There's no shame in retreating 
if you're hopelessly outnumbered.</b>

17:51.380 --> 17:54.380
<b>I want you to give it all you're worth, but this isn't a suicide mission.</b>

17:55.130 --> 17:57.550
<b>They're the last remaining rats that defy the capital.</b>

17:57.550 --> 17:59.890
<b>Chase them down, and exterminate them!</b>

18:00.220 --> 18:01.260
<b>Roger that!</b>

18:04.980 --> 18:08.020
<b>So our opponents are the most powerful assassins in the empire, Night Raid.</b>

18:08.020 --> 18:10.110
<b>I wonder if someone like me can win.</b>

18:10.110 --> 18:11.400
<b>It'll be fine.</b>

18:11.400 --> 18:14.740
<b>When I encountered a Night Raid member earlier,</b>

18:14.740 --> 18:17.110
<b>he refused my challenge to battle.</b>

18:17.110 --> 18:19.780
<b>But I could tell he was about as strong as I am.</b>

18:20.490 --> 18:23.290
<b>If we fight together, we'll definitely win.</b>

18:23.290 --> 18:26.330
<b>Bols, your Imperial Relic is excellent for taking on multiple opponents.</b>

18:26.330 --> 18:28.120
<b>Glad to have you with us.</b>

18:28.120 --> 18:29.580
<b>You think so?</b>

18:29.580 --> 18:31.840
<b>You're good at saying what people want to hear,</b>

18:32.250 --> 18:34.250
<b>but you'll probably hold us back the most, Wave.</b>

18:34.250 --> 18:35.090
<b>What was that?</b>

18:35.090 --> 18:37.970
<b>Are you saying you don't trust my skill?!</b>

18:37.970 --> 18:40.800
<b>That's right. I feel like you'll buckle when we need you most.</b>

18:40.800 --> 18:43.260
<b>If I activate Grand Chariot—</b>

18:43.260 --> 18:44.890
<b>Then demonstrate your strength to me.</b>

18:44.890 --> 18:46.890
<b>I'd be happy to!</b>

18:46.890 --> 18:48.890
<b>This isn't the time to be fighting.</b>

18:50.730 --> 18:52.770
<b>Hey, there's something ahead of us.</b>

19:06.040 --> 19:09.040
<b><i>Judging by their numbers, 
it looks like they split up</i></b>
