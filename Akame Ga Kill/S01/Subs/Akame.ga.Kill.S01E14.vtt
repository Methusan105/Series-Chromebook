02:56.900 --> 02:58.490
<b>I see.</b>

02:58.490 --> 03:01.570
<b>Your physique has certainly become more pronounced.</b>

03:01.570 --> 03:02.870
<b>And you've clearly leveled up.</b>

03:03.830 --> 03:05.950
<b>You've done well in so short a time.</b>

03:05.950 --> 03:07.910
<b>I'm sure you'll continue to grow even stronger!</b>

03:07.910 --> 03:09.290
<b>W-Well...</b>

03:09.870 --> 03:12.290
<b><i>This isn't the time to let her sweet-talk me!</i></b>

03:12.710 --> 03:16.130
<b>The Danger Beasts here are pretty much wiped out.</b>

03:16.130 --> 03:18.090
<b>They were annoying, but...</b>

03:19.220 --> 03:21.430
<b>In a way, they led me to you.</b>

03:21.430 --> 03:23.390
<b>This can only be the work of fate.</b>

03:25.970 --> 03:28.730
<b>There's a surprising number of nuisances around here.</b>

03:29.140 --> 03:30.520
<b>You. The one who just hid.</b>

03:30.520 --> 03:32.770
<b>I know you're there. Come out.</b>

03:33.310 --> 03:35.690
<b>If you do not, I will strike with no further hesitation.</b>

03:38.650 --> 03:42.070
<b>Not bad. I thought I'd hidden pretty well.</b>

03:42.070 --> 03:45.990
<b>They don't call you the empire's strongest for nothing.</b>

03:45.990 --> 03:49.160
<b>I didn't think I'd run into you out here, though.</b>

03:49.160 --> 03:52.330
<b>I guess playtime's over.</b>

03:52.960 --> 03:56.840
<b>Sounds like you know why 
the Danger Beasts are loose.</b>

03:56.840 --> 03:58.920
<b>Allow me to escort you to the torture room.</b>

03:58.920 --> 04:01.970
<b>Sorry, but that's not my kind of thing.</b>

04:01.970 --> 04:06.350
<b>How about you take care of a few big toys of mine?{l-lewd (I have no video context. :c)}</b>

04:06.760 --> 04:08.260
<b>Imperial Relic Shambhala!{oh it's him}</b>

04:08.260 --> 04:09.100
<b>Activate!</b>

04:13.640 --> 04:15.100
<b>Wh-What's happening?</b>

04:22.360 --> 04:23.740
<b>Now, then.</b>

04:23.740 --> 04:27.120
<b>Who shall I play with next?</b>

04:29.700 --> 04:30.790
<b>Wh...</b>

04:30.790 --> 04:33.290
<b>What the hell is this?</b>

04:34.040 --> 04:36.290
<b>E-Esdeath...</b>

04:36.290 --> 04:37.710
<b>Could you hurt me, please?</b>

04:38.210 --> 04:39.500
<b>Tatsumi...</b>

04:39.500 --> 04:41.710
<b>I didn't know you were into that.</b>

04:41.710 --> 04:44.470
<b>We really <i>are</i> meant for each other.</b>

04:44.470 --> 04:46.470
<b>That isn't what I meant!</b>

04:46.470 --> 04:49.560
<b>That guy could be causing us to hallucinate all of this!</b>

04:50.010 --> 04:53.850
<b>If so, a little pain might snap us out of it!</b>

04:53.850 --> 04:54.730
<b>All right.</b>

04:55.270 --> 04:56.230
<b>Here goes.</b>

05:03.570 --> 05:05.320
<b>It isn't an illusion.</b>

05:05.320 --> 05:07.370
<b>The sensations are too real.</b>

05:07.370 --> 05:09.450
<b>The smell of salt and the ocean breeze...</b>

05:09.450 --> 05:11.040
<b>Temperature and humidity.</b>

05:11.040 --> 05:13.330
<b>I'd say this is reality.</b>

05:13.330 --> 05:14.410
<b>Which means...</b>

05:14.410 --> 05:18.000
<b>The man we saw before might 
have used some kind of ability.</b>

05:18.000 --> 05:19.750
<b>Did he teleport us here?</b>

05:20.170 --> 05:21.920
<b>Is that really possible?</b>

05:22.880 --> 05:27.430
<b>Forty-eight powerful armaments known as 
Imperial Relics lie scattered across the empire.</b>

05:27.430 --> 05:31.010
<b>I've heard that some can manipulate space and time,</b>

05:31.010 --> 05:34.180
<b>using secret arts from a lost country.</b>

05:34.180 --> 05:36.270
<b>Really? That's incredible!</b>

05:36.440 --> 05:37.560
<b><i>But wait...</i></b>

05:38.100 --> 05:42.320
<b><i>Is that how Incursio appears out of thin air when I call for it?</i></b>

05:43.570 --> 05:47.530
<b><i>When I think about it that way, 
it really scares me for some reason.</i></b>

05:48.200 --> 05:51.990
<b><i>Manipulating space and time is a powerful ability.</i></b>

05:51.990 --> 05:54.620
<b><i>Whatever Relic he has, 
it's definitely among the strongest.</i></b>

05:55.330 --> 05:57.080
<b><i>Just who is he?</i></b>

05:57.080 --> 05:59.580
<b>For now, let's get the lay of the land.</b>

06:03.800 --> 06:05.880
<b>Ocean as far as the eye can see.</b>

06:06.550 --> 06:09.010
<b>What a beautiful view.</b>

06:09.840 --> 06:13.260
<b>It's like we're on a date.</b>

06:13.260 --> 06:14.770
<b>You sure are calm.</b>

06:15.430 --> 06:18.390
<b>The power of the Imperial Relics 
surpasses imagination.</b>

06:18.390 --> 06:21.150
<b>You'll need to keep an open mind if you want to survive.</b>

06:21.150 --> 06:22.820
<b>I see.</b>

06:22.820 --> 06:24.570
<b>Anyway, as I was saying...</b>

06:25.150 --> 06:27.280
<b>It's like we're on a date!</b>

06:27.280 --> 06:28.780
<b>W-Wait a second!</b>

06:31.070 --> 06:32.410
<b>A giant Danger Beast.</b>

06:32.740 --> 06:33.870
<b><i>That thing...</i></b>

06:33.870 --> 06:36.870
<b><i>looks exactly like Dr. Stylish after his transformation.</i></b>

06:36.870 --> 06:40.880
<b><i>It took all of Night Raid to bring him down.</i></b>

06:41.210 --> 06:42.500
<b><i>Can we win?</i></b>

06:42.500 --> 06:44.340
<b><i>With just the two of us?{esdeath is OP so probably}</i></b>

06:45.340 --> 06:47.010
<b>Whoa, here he comes!</b>

06:47.010 --> 06:49.510
<b>I have no mercy for nuisances.</b>

06:50.590 --> 06:53.800
<b>An ugly hunk of meat like you 
deserves a good skewering!</b>

06:54.180 --> 06:55.770
<b>Weissschnabel!</b>

07:01.440 --> 07:03.810
<b><i>Amazing. She felled it in an instant.</i></b>

07:06.400 --> 07:07.820
<b>He's tougher than I thought.</b>

07:07.820 --> 07:09.320
<b>This is getting interesting.</b>

07:09.320 --> 07:12.110
<b>Um, that spot on his forehead...</b>

07:12.110 --> 07:13.950
<b>It looks pretty fragile, doesn't it?</b>

07:14.660 --> 07:16.660
<b>My thoughts exactly.</b>

07:16.660 --> 07:18.250
<b>We really are meant for each other.</b>

07:18.250 --> 07:19.500
<b>Grauhorn!</b>

07:21.170 --> 07:22.500
<b>How tenacious.</b>

07:24.590 --> 07:25.590
<b>Tatsumi!</b>

07:34.050 --> 07:35.350
<b>Magnificent.</b>

07:35.350 --> 07:39.680
<b>I wanted to charm you by showing off,</b>

07:39.680 --> 07:42.310
<b>but I didn't expect that you'd charm me even more.</b>

07:42.310 --> 07:45.440
<b>I even called out my special move.</b>

07:45.440 --> 07:46.690
<b>There's still more?</b>

07:48.230 --> 07:49.400
<b>Leave it to me.</b>

07:49.400 --> 07:51.400
<b>I'll give it a fitting death.</b>

07:59.500 --> 08:01.370
<b>Hagelsprung!</b>

08:06.130 --> 08:08.090
<b>What a crazy fighting style.</b>

08:08.590 --> 08:10.840
<b>She's on a completely different level.</b>

08:11.420 --> 08:14.390
<b><i>So this is the true power of the empire's strongest.</i></b>

08:15.260 --> 08:18.220
<b><i>How are you going to kill her, Akame?{end of part a}</i></b>

08:21.890 --> 08:24.810
<b>It seems there were only two of them.</b>

08:24.810 --> 08:27.940
<b>So those were the "toys" he was referring to.</b>

08:27.940 --> 08:31.530
<b>Apparently this is where he hid the new breed of Danger Beast.</b>

08:31.900 --> 08:34.110
<b>After we've caught our breath, what should we do?</b>

08:34.110 --> 08:36.700
<b>First, we'll investigate our surroundings.</b>

08:36.700 --> 08:39.450
<b>We must gain an understanding of our environment.</b>

08:39.450 --> 08:40.410
<b>That's true.</b>

08:40.410 --> 08:42.500
<b>There are far too many things we don't know.</b>

08:42.500 --> 08:44.960
<b>Panicking leads to an early grave.</b>

08:44.960 --> 08:46.380
<b>We'll stay calm while venturing out.</b>

08:46.380 --> 08:47.500
<b>Roger that!</b>

08:47.500 --> 08:48.670
<b>Let's go!</b>

08:48.670 --> 08:51.960
<b><i>I didn't even think before responding.</i></b>

08:51.960 --> 08:53.760
<b><i>I have to remember she's my enemy.</i></b>

08:54.800 --> 08:55.840
<b>Hmm...</b>

08:56.340 --> 08:57.600
<b>Not much resemblance.</b>

09:18.740 --> 09:21.540
<b>We spent all day exploring, and now it's dark.</b>

09:21.990 --> 09:24.960
<b>It was fun, though.</b>

09:24.960 --> 09:26.670
<b>Uh, yeah.</b>

09:27.540 --> 09:30.840
<b>And I've managed to determine where we are.</b>

09:30.840 --> 09:32.000
<b>Huh?</b>

09:32.000 --> 09:35.260
<b>This is a deserted island to the far southeast of the capital.</b>

09:35.260 --> 09:38.050
<b>Th-The far southeast?</b>

09:38.050 --> 09:40.640
<b>He sure teleported us far.</b>

09:40.640 --> 09:41.890
<b>Basically,</b>

09:42.470 --> 09:46.020
<b>we're all alone on a deserted island. Just you and me.</b>

09:46.020 --> 09:48.400
<b>So what would you like to do, Tatsumi?</b>

09:48.400 --> 09:50.520
<b>It's your destiny. Your choice.</b>

09:51.150 --> 09:51.360
<b>Tatsumi</b>

09:51.360 --> 09:52.900
<b>Living here together for a bit doesn't seem so bad.</b>

09:51.360 --> 09:56.280
<b>Tatsumi</b>

09:51.900 --> 09:53.070
<b>No matter what, we must return to the capital and live there.</b>

09:52.690 --> 09:53.280
<b>Take me now.</b>

09:52.900 --> 09:56.280
<b>Living here together for a bit doesn't seem so bad.</b>

09:53.070 --> 09:56.280

09:56.280 --> 09:56.530
<b>Take me now.</b>

09:56.490 --> 09:58.660

09:56.530 --> 09:56.570
<b>Tatsumi</b>

09:56.530 --> 09:56.570

09:58.610 --> 09:58.660

09:59.070 --> 10:00.990
<b>You're no fun.</b>

10:00.990 --> 10:03.790
<b>How can you be so composed?</b>

10:03.790 --> 10:06.460
<b>Because I think I know how we can get back.</b>

10:06.460 --> 10:07.290
<b>Don't worry.</b>

10:07.290 --> 10:08.460
<b>Wow!</b>

10:08.460 --> 10:11.540
<b>However, I need you to do your part too.</b>

10:11.540 --> 10:12.500
<b>Got it?</b>

10:12.500 --> 10:13.670
<b>O-Okay!</b>

10:14.550 --> 10:17.550
<b><i>I have a terribly bad feeling about this.</i></b>

10:17.550 --> 10:20.720
<b><i>But maybe I'll get a chance to escape along the way.</i></b>

10:20.720 --> 10:22.640
<b><i>I'm willing to take a risk for that!</i></b>

10:27.730 --> 10:28.640
<b>As I thought.</b>

10:28.640 --> 10:31.860
<b>There was a clue hidden where we first arrived.</b>

10:32.480 --> 10:36.440
<b>Does this mean he can only teleport to places he's marked like this?</b>

10:36.940 --> 10:38.950
<b>Judging from the area he activated when moving us,</b>

10:38.950 --> 10:41.660
<b>it seems he can only move a few people at once.</b>

10:41.660 --> 10:44.540
<b>It must also require a tremendous amount of energy to do so.</b>

10:44.540 --> 10:45.790
<b>He probably can't keep doing it.</b>

10:45.790 --> 10:48.080
<b>Which means that if we stand guard over this spot...</b>

10:48.460 --> 10:50.670
<b>The gate may reopen eventually.</b>

10:51.290 --> 10:53.540
<b>That's one way to get back, anyway.</b>

10:53.880 --> 10:57.170
<b>There's another way that's more likely to get us back, but before that...</b>

10:57.170 --> 10:58.590
<b>Before?</b>

10:59.220 --> 11:03.100
<b>Since it's just the two of us here, 
let's get to know each other better!</b>

11:06.720 --> 11:08.020
<b>T-Time out!</b>

11:08.020 --> 11:10.980
<b>W-We can get to know each other in a different way!</b>

11:10.980 --> 11:12.650
<b>Would you like me to stop?</b>

11:12.650 --> 11:15.770
<b>Then tell me your story.</b>

11:15.770 --> 11:18.570
<b>First, where did you learn to wield a sword?</b>

11:18.570 --> 11:21.490
<b>Th-There was a retired soldier who lived in my village.</b>

11:21.820 --> 11:23.780
<b>He used to be a martial arts instructor, too.</b>

11:23.780 --> 11:26.450
<b>He taught me well.</b>

11:26.450 --> 11:27.620
<b>I see.</b>

11:28.370 --> 11:30.830
<b>Is that also where you learned to forge weapons?</b>

11:30.830 --> 11:35.040
<b>I wanted to learn a lot of different things so I could make a living in the capital.</b>

11:35.540 --> 11:39.670
<b>You must be quite skilled to have learned so much.</b>

11:39.670 --> 11:43.340
<b>You also seem like you can do 
practically anything, Esdeath.</b>

11:43.340 --> 11:43.930
<b>Not quite.</b>

11:44.390 --> 11:46.810
<b>I don't really take to the fine arts.</b>

11:46.810 --> 11:51.190
<b>When I heard instruments like Nyau's flute, 
I couldn't understand what was so good about them.</b>

11:52.190 --> 11:54.900
<b><i>This is the perfect chance to pump her for information!</i></b>

11:54.900 --> 11:58.190
<b><i>Not to mention, if she cares this much about me,</i></b>

11:58.190 --> 12:03.280
<b><i>there might still be some way 
I can convince her to be our ally.</i></b>

12:03.280 --> 12:06.740
<b><i>It would be much better to have her 
with us than against us.</i></b>

12:08.290 --> 12:11.750
<b>You weren't born in the capital, were you, Esdeath?</b>

12:11.750 --> 12:12.620
<b>That's right.</b>

12:12.620 --> 12:14.880
<b>I'm from the northern border.</b>

12:14.880 --> 12:17.500
<b>Have you ever heard of the Paltas Clan?</b>

12:17.500 --> 12:18.050
<b>No.</b>

12:18.750 --> 12:21.510
<b>They're a race of people who hunt Danger Beasts.</b>

12:21.510 --> 12:24.680
<b>I grew up there as the chief's daughter.</b>

12:25.760 --> 12:29.180
<b>Since you told me about your past, 
I'll tell you about mine.</b>

12:35.560 --> 12:38.270
<b>Father, I caught my prey!</b>

12:38.270 --> 12:39.400
<b>Wow, good job!</b>

12:39.820 --> 12:42.030
<b>That one's quite impressive for your age.</b>

12:42.030 --> 12:43.780
<b>But mine's even better!</b>

12:45.320 --> 12:47.700
<b>We're just about to dissect it for materials.</b>

12:47.700 --> 12:48.580
<b>Lend us a hand.</b>

12:48.580 --> 12:49.240
<b>Okay!</b>

12:50.080 --> 12:54.080
<b>Weakened and bound as it is, 
it won't be able to struggle much.</b>

12:54.080 --> 12:56.040
<b>We'll do this boldly and quickly.</b>

12:57.040 --> 12:59.800
<b>They always scream so loudly.</b>

13:00.380 --> 13:04.590
<b>We need to remove the lizard orb while it's still alive, or it won't be as valuable.</b>

13:04.590 --> 13:07.510
<b>I'm sure it causes great pain, but that's how it goes.</b>

13:07.970 --> 13:11.310
<b>These beasts attack and eat people.</b>

13:11.310 --> 13:16.190
<b>This time around, we were the stronger ones, 
so it wound up dead instead.</b>

13:16.850 --> 13:19.770
<b>That's just what happens to the weak.</b>

13:19.770 --> 13:22.900
<b>All right, Esdeath, you remove the eyes and crest.</b>

13:23.320 --> 13:25.700
<b>Okay. I'll do it cleanly.</b>

13:26.780 --> 13:30.280
<b><i>Esdeath can land the final blow on any prey without hesitation,</i></b>

13:30.280 --> 13:32.750
<b><i>even if it's weakened or running away.</i></b>

13:33.370 --> 13:34.910
<b><i>She's a natural hunter.</i></b>

13:35.330 --> 13:39.210
<b><i>But she seems to be lacking something.</i></b>

13:39.210 --> 13:41.420
<b><i>Well, I guess it's not a problem.</i></b>

13:42.920 --> 13:44.510
<b>Eat or be eaten...</b>

13:44.510 --> 13:47.510
<b>That's the glorious environment I was brought up in.</b>

13:47.510 --> 13:49.390
<b>The Danger Beasts and us...</b>

13:49.390 --> 13:53.100
<b>It was fun living in a world where 
both sides tried their hardest to survive.</b>

13:54.730 --> 13:56.850
<b>Oh? Are the ants at war?</b>

13:56.850 --> 13:57.520
<b>Yeah.</b>

13:57.520 --> 14:00.440
<b>It looks like the winner's already been decided.</b>

14:00.440 --> 14:05.860
<b>Look, the queen's been dragged out and lynched by enemy soldiers.</b>

14:05.860 --> 14:07.530
<b>The fate of the weak, huh?</b>

14:07.530 --> 14:09.160
<b>That's right.</b>

14:09.160 --> 14:13.540
<b>Your mother was eaten by a high-level Danger Beast just like that.</b>

14:14.040 --> 14:15.790
<b>But that too is just how it goes.</b>

14:16.540 --> 14:20.170
<b>It's sad, but she was hunted because she was weak.</b>

14:20.170 --> 14:21.790
<b>And that's all there is to it.</b>

14:21.790 --> 14:23.750
<b><i>The strong win.</i></b>

14:23.750 --> 14:25.050
<b><i>The weak perish.</i></b>

14:28.090 --> 14:30.470
<b>It was worth waiting in the mountains for days.</b>

14:30.470 --> 14:32.640
<b>I was able to catch a rare evil-bird!</b>

14:32.640 --> 14:35.060
<b>Father will be so proud!</b>

14:38.560 --> 14:40.310
<b>Wh-What is this?</b>

14:43.070 --> 14:44.230
<b>Are you all right?</b>

14:44.940 --> 14:49.490
<b>The northern race crossed the border and attacked.</b>

14:49.490 --> 14:53.280
<b>The chief stood on the front lines and defeated dozens of them.</b>

14:53.280 --> 14:55.990
<b>But in the end, they overpowered him.</b>

14:57.500 --> 14:58.790
<b>Father!</b>

14:59.160 --> 15:01.420
<b>Esdeath...</b>

15:01.420 --> 15:03.040
<b>As you can see...</b>

15:03.040 --> 15:06.050
<b>We were weaker, so we lost.</b>

15:06.050 --> 15:08.260
<b>That's how it goes.</b>

15:08.260 --> 15:10.840
<b>Live strong, Esdeath.</b>

15:12.470 --> 15:14.680
<b>Not that I need to worry about that.</b>

15:15.600 --> 15:18.230
<b>After that, I continued to hunt Danger Beasts on my own.</b>

15:18.770 --> 15:22.560
<b>But prey was becoming scarce, 
so I went to the capital to join the military.</b>

15:22.560 --> 15:26.690
<b>It was simply a matter of shifting from 
killing Danger Beasts to killing humans.</b>

15:26.690 --> 15:29.360
<b>And that's my story.</b>

15:29.360 --> 15:34.120
<b>So I guess you had a reason to fight the northern race.</b>

15:34.120 --> 15:35.120
<b>Hmm?</b>

15:35.120 --> 15:38.870
<b>They were my adversaries, but not out of revenge.</b>

15:40.330 --> 15:44.130
<b>Really? I heard you buried hundreds of thousands of them alive.</b>

15:44.630 --> 15:47.670
<b>That was simply to cut costs and set an example.</b>

15:47.670 --> 15:50.880
<b>My personal feelings never entered the equation.</b>

15:50.880 --> 15:52.630
<b>The empire ordered me to do so, and I did.</b>

15:55.050 --> 15:57.350
<b>I do grieve for my father,</b>

15:57.350 --> 15:59.850
<b>but in the end, he too died because he was weak.</b>

16:00.980 --> 16:03.190
<b>Is there anything else you'd like to ask?</b>

16:03.190 --> 16:05.690
<b>I'll tell you anything, provided it's about me.</b>

16:05.690 --> 16:08.360
<b>Oh, then...</b>

16:08.360 --> 16:11.860
<b>I'm curious as to what your 
Imperial Relic actually looks like.</b>

16:12.320 --> 16:13.660
<b>Oh, that?</b>

16:14.110 --> 16:15.740
<b>My Relic...</b>

16:16.620 --> 16:17.330
<b>is here.</b>

16:17.780 --> 16:19.160
<b>It's this.</b>

16:19.160 --> 16:20.040
<b>Huh?</b>

16:21.410 --> 16:23.420
<b>It happened a few years ago.</b>

16:24.670 --> 16:27.420
<b>I've prepared several Imperial Relics,</b>

16:27.420 --> 16:30.340
<b>but none seem quite suited to you.</b>

16:30.800 --> 16:33.340
<b>I like this axe. It's rather splendid.</b>

16:33.720 --> 16:35.470
<b>But it doesn't quite feel right.</b>

16:37.470 --> 16:39.850
<b>Is that urn over there an Imperial Relic as well?</b>

16:39.850 --> 16:42.430
<b>That Relic is the Demon's Extract.</b>

16:42.430 --> 16:45.980
<b>It's the lifeblood of a high-level 
Danger Beast that lived far to the north.</b>

16:45.980 --> 16:48.110
<b>The blood itself is a Relic?</b>

16:48.110 --> 16:51.530
<b>According to legend, if a compatible person drinks it,</b>

16:51.530 --> 16:55.950
<b>they will gain that Danger Beast's dominion over ice.</b>

16:55.950 --> 17:00.370
<b>But all who have tried were rendered insane.</b>

17:00.370 --> 17:02.500
<b>It's not worth the risk.</b>

17:02.500 --> 17:04.670
<b>That sounds quite interesting.</b>

17:04.670 --> 17:06.380
<b>W-Wait, you're not going to drink it, are you?</b>

17:06.380 --> 17:09.380
<b>Regardless of how sadistic you may be, I can't guarantee you'll be compatible!</b>

17:10.380 --> 17:12.590
<b>The blood is calling to me.</b>

17:12.590 --> 17:14.260
<b>I feel compelled to try it.</b>

17:14.260 --> 17:15.680
<b>I see.</b>

17:15.680 --> 17:18.350
<b>Then you may very well be compatible.</b>

17:18.350 --> 17:18.930
<b>I think so.</b>

17:19.350 --> 17:22.890
<b>Somehow, I'm certain it will agree with me.</b>

17:22.890 --> 17:24.980
<b>If my instincts, sharpened in the wild, should fail me,</b>

17:24.980 --> 17:27.020
<b>then I suppose I am not fit to live any longer.</b>

17:28.310 --> 17:30.770
<b>One glass should be enough.</b>

17:30.770 --> 17:32.730
<b>I might as well drink it all.</b>

17:32.730 --> 17:35.240
<b>I feel that it'll make me stronger that way.</b>

17:35.650 --> 17:39.490
<b>Since you're already crazy, 
perhaps it won't drive you mad.</b>

17:46.920 --> 17:48.210
<b>That tasted quite—</b>

17:51.880 --> 17:58.840
<b><i>Kill. Seize. Attack. Steal. Destroy. Break. Harm.</i></b>

18:02.600 --> 18:04.730
<b>What destructive urges.</b>

18:04.730 --> 18:05.640
<b>I see.</b>

18:05.640 --> 18:08.350
<b>So they were driven to insanity by this.</b>

18:08.350 --> 18:09.520
<b>And yet...</b>

18:09.520 --> 18:10.810
<b>How tame!</b>

18:10.810 --> 18:13.230
<b>These mild impulses could never influence me.</b>

18:16.900 --> 18:19.950
<b>I am the dominator,</b>

18:19.950 --> 18:22.030
<b>regardless of who I face.</b>

18:22.030 --> 18:24.790
<b>I act on my own will, and nothing else.</b>

18:28.000 --> 18:30.790
<b>This is sublime, Prime Minister.</b>

18:30.790 --> 18:33.250
<b>I can feel the power coursing through my entire body.</b>

18:33.250 --> 18:36.130
<b>Looks like it's completely adapted to you.</b>

18:36.130 --> 18:39.510
<b>A toast to the birth of the strongest soldier in history.</b>

18:39.510 --> 18:40.970
<b>Cheers.</b>

18:41.640 --> 18:45.850
<b>So even now, the blood of a Danger Beast 
flows through your veins?</b>

18:45.850 --> 18:46.980
<b>That's right.</b>

18:46.980 --> 18:49.350
<b>But it's tamed, so don't worry.</b>

18:49.940 --> 18:52.480
<b>Is that how you developed a taste for torture?</b>

18:52.480 --> 18:54.320
<b>No, I've always been into that.</b>

18:55.070 --> 18:57.490
<b><i>If she had been driven mad with revenge</i></b>

18:57.490 --> 18:59.950
<b><i>or the Danger Beast's blood 
...</i></b><b><i>had robbed her of her sanity...</i></b>

18:59.950 --> 19:02.160
<b><i>That, I would have understood.</i></b>

19:02.910 --> 19:06.700
<b><i>But she's always been like this.</i></b>

19:06.700 --> 19:09.250
<b><i>There's no way I can change her very nature!</i></b>

19:09.870 --> 19:14.210
<b><i>I was far too naïve to think 
I could simply convince her.</i></b>

19:14.210 --> 19:15.250
<b>Now, then...</b>

19:15.250 --> 19:17.670
<b>I wonder how they're doing.</b>

19:17.670 --> 19:20.550
<b>They'd better not have died on me or anything.</b>

19:20.550 --> 19:23.550
<b>Guess I should open the way back.</b>

19:23.550 --> 19:26.560
<b>Shambhala Point-B Release.</b>

19:28.310 --> 19:30.060
<b>That should do it.</b>

19:31.140 --> 19:32.940
<b>What are you doing over there?</b>

19:33.520 --> 19:34.610
<b>None of your business, wench.</b>

19:34.610 --> 19:41.740
<b>You speak roughly, but there is 
an air of refinement around you.</b>

19:41.740 --> 19:45.240
<b>Well, of course. I'm the son of Prime Minister Honest.</b>

19:45.990 --> 19:47.490
<b>The prime minister? <i>Him</i>?</b>

19:51.670 --> 19:54.080
<b>You will not speak of him in such a tone!</b>

19:54.460 --> 19:56.840
<b>I'll have you know I look up to my father.</b>

19:56.840 --> 19:59.340
<b>Well, I'm sure I'll surpass him one day.</b>

19:59.340 --> 20:04.050
<b>But wouldn't you say that surpassing a parent is the ultimate form of filial piety?</b>

20:04.970 --> 20:08.430
<b>S-So, what's the other way to get back?</b>

20:08.430 --> 20:10.560
<b>I guess I should tell you now.</b>

20:10.560 --> 20:12.140
<b>We'll need some kind of transport.</b>

20:12.600 --> 20:16.150
<b>It's possible to ride on some Danger Beasts' backs.</b>

20:16.900 --> 20:22.200
<b>They can be quite difficult to tame, but not for me.</b>

20:22.200 --> 20:24.280
<b>Wait a second, like that one?</b>

20:25.410 --> 20:28.240
<b>Speak of the devil. What a shame.</b>

20:28.240 --> 20:30.580
<b>Wh-What are you going to do?</b>

20:30.580 --> 20:32.120
<b>It's so high up!</b>

20:32.120 --> 20:34.080
<b>I'll train it after I bring it down!</b>

20:34.080 --> 20:35.580
<b>You're not getting away!</b>

20:37.750 --> 20:38.750
<b>Whoa!</b>

20:38.750 --> 20:40.670
<b>This is the way back!</b>

20:41.170 --> 20:43.300
<b>If I sneak out right now...</b>

20:45.010 --> 20:47.760
<b>She did look after me here, though.</b>

20:48.720 --> 20:50.140
<b>I should return the favor.</b>

20:50.720 --> 20:51.930
<b>Esdeath!</b>

20:51.930 --> 20:53.770
<b>Some kind of exit appeared!</b>

20:53.770 --> 20:55.060
<b>I'll go in first!</b>

20:56.560 --> 20:57.650
<b>Wait, Tatsumi!</b>

20:58.060 --> 20:59.070
<b>Wait!</b>

21:02.990 --> 21:05.860
<b>This is the mountain we were on yesterday.</b>

21:05.860 --> 21:07.570
<b>It seems we've returned.</b>

21:07.570 --> 21:09.530
<b>Where are you, Tatsumi?</b>

21:10.120 --> 21:13.210
<b>Could he have escaped in that small amount of time?</b>

21:13.210 --> 21:14.330
<b>That's not possible.</b>

21:14.330 --> 21:15.580
<b>We were separated for mere moments!</b>

21:16.250 --> 21:19.960
<b><i>I may be invisible right now, 
but I can't hide my presence if I move.</i></b>

21:19.960 --> 21:23.260
<b><i>I'll have to lie low for a while.</i></b>

21:23.260 --> 21:24.380
<b>He isn't here.</b>

21:25.470 --> 21:28.800
<b>Was he sent elsewhere?</b>

21:28.800 --> 21:32.350
<b>Either way, we've been separated again.</b>

21:34.020 --> 21:36.810
<b>However, what happens twice will happen thrice.{fool me once...}</b>

21:37.310 --> 21:40.070
<b>We'll meet again, won't we?</b>

21:40.770 --> 21:43.280
<b><i>Indeed. I have the same feeling.</i></b>

21:43.280 --> 21:45.650
<b><i>But now I know for sure.</i></b>

21:45.650 --> 21:48.070
<b><i>There's no way I can convince her.</i></b>

21:48.070 --> 21:51.620
<b><i>That's why the next time we meet</i></b>

21:51.620 --> 21:53.410
<b><i>will be as enemies.</i></b>

21:53.410 --> 21:55.410
