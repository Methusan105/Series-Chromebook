03:52.830 --> 03:54.420
<b>Okay, then.</b>

03:54.920 --> 03:58.090
<b>M-My apologies.</b>

03:58.090 --> 04:00.090
<b>We don't have room for a lot of people, so...</b>

04:05.300 --> 04:06.100
<b>Whoa, scary!</b>

04:09.520 --> 04:10.810
<b>Get behind me.</b>

04:10.810 --> 04:11.680
<b>Akame!</b>

04:20.280 --> 04:21.530
<b>Nicely executed.</b>

04:24.660 --> 04:25.700
<b>Another one!</b>

04:26.120 --> 04:28.200
<b>Though we are enemies, I compliment you.</b>

04:31.290 --> 04:32.250
<b><i>He's powerful.</i></b>

04:32.960 --> 04:34.710
<b>My name is Toby.</b>

04:34.710 --> 04:37.500
<b>I request a duel with Akame!</b>

04:46.930 --> 04:48.390
<b><i>This man...</i></b>

04:50.930 --> 04:54.310
<b><i>He feels different from the rest. Like a machine.</i></b>

04:54.310 --> 04:55.390
<b>Akame!</b>

05:00.110 --> 05:02.940
<b>You're in my way!</b>

05:16.540 --> 05:18.790
<b>Ah, there you are.</b>

05:20.960 --> 05:23.300
<b>Hey, armored guy.</b>

05:23.300 --> 05:26.220
<b>Looks like you're up against me, Kakusan.</b>

05:27.470 --> 05:29.300
<b>That Relic...</b>

05:29.300 --> 05:30.430
<b>Like it?</b>

05:30.430 --> 05:32.810
<b>It's the Absolute Bisector, Extase.</b>

05:32.810 --> 05:34.930
<b>A delightful little Relic of mine.</b>

05:35.350 --> 05:38.770
<b>That doesn't belong to you!</b>

05:46.240 --> 05:49.660
<b>Cut through flesh, and rend it from bone!</b>

05:51.870 --> 05:55.250
<b>Nice reflexes. I thought I got you there.</b>

05:57.000 --> 05:59.710
<b>So much for that thick armor of yours.</b>

05:59.710 --> 06:01.130
<b>I hate to break it to you,</b>

06:01.500 --> 06:05.260
<b>but this Imperial Relic can cut through anything in creation.</b>

06:05.260 --> 06:08.050
<b>All the armor in the world won't save you!</b>

06:08.720 --> 06:11.890
<b>As we projected, those two have the upper hand 
against Murasame and Incursio.</b>

06:11.890 --> 06:13.850
<b>Just as I suspected.</b>

06:13.850 --> 06:17.060
<b>It's all about finding a good match-up.</b>

06:17.560 --> 06:21.020
<b>We seem to have lost quite
a few foot soldiers, though.</b>

06:21.020 --> 06:24.280
<b>It's hard to hear properly over the noise,</b>

06:24.940 --> 06:26.530
<b>but casualties seem high.</b>

06:27.280 --> 06:29.280
<b>What a tragic loss...</b>

06:30.780 --> 06:32.280
<b><i>Not.</i></b>

06:32.910 --> 06:35.870
<b><i>I have plenty of soldiers to spare.</i></b>

06:35.870 --> 06:38.080
<b><i>They're all pathetic criminals</i></b>

06:38.080 --> 06:42.880
<b><i>who thought they could work
for me to reduce their sentences.</i></b>

06:43.380 --> 06:47.840
<b><i>Little do they know they'll be my lab rats until the day they die.</i></b>

06:47.840 --> 06:49.220
<b>Give that back!</b>

06:50.510 --> 06:51.760
<b>It belongs to Sheele!</b>

06:52.760 --> 06:54.260
<b>Who the hell is that?</b>

06:58.640 --> 07:01.650
<b>Do you have that much of a death wish?</b>

07:01.650 --> 07:03.440
<b>I'll cut you so small the worms won't have to chew.</b>

07:04.270 --> 07:05.690
<b>What are you floundering around for?</b>

07:07.990 --> 07:09.820
<b>Sloppy as always, huh?</b>

07:14.490 --> 07:15.660
<b>Mine!</b>

07:18.660 --> 07:21.080
<b>Those weaklings couldn't even buy me time.</b>

07:21.080 --> 07:22.960
<b>Now another one's here.</b>

07:23.330 --> 07:25.170
<b>Let's get this over with.</b>

07:25.750 --> 07:28.760
<b>Just seeing Extase in enemy hands pisses me off.</b>

07:28.760 --> 07:31.260
<b>Get this over with?</b>

07:31.260 --> 07:34.470
<b>Are you really in any position to be saying that?</b>

07:34.470 --> 07:37.350
<b>Your hideout was found, you've been breached,</b>

07:37.350 --> 07:39.810
<b>and now your enemies are attacking head-on.</b>

07:39.810 --> 07:40.980
<b>Precisely.</b>

07:40.980 --> 07:44.770
<b>Time to put your money where your mouth is!</b>

07:49.150 --> 07:54.200
<b><i>You fool. My augmented body overcame even Incursio.</i></b>

07:54.200 --> 07:56.160
<b><i>I can take a gunshot on the chin.</i></b>

08:04.920 --> 08:06.500
<b><i>It's too powerful!</i></b>

08:12.760 --> 08:15.090
<b>The more danger I'm in, the more damage I do.</b>

08:16.640 --> 08:18.850
<b>You underestimated my ability.</b>

08:42.910 --> 08:45.370
<b><i>Welcome home, Sheele.</i></b>

08:50.550 --> 08:52.340
<b>Kakusan is down.</b>

08:52.840 --> 08:55.340
<b>And most of our foot soldiers have been wiped out.</b>

08:55.340 --> 08:56.550
<b>Oh, dear.</b>

08:56.550 --> 08:57.970
<b>I miscalculated.</b>

08:57.970 --> 09:00.640
<b>Well, in that case...</b>

09:02.560 --> 09:05.190
<b>Something's coming from above!</b>

09:09.860 --> 09:12.440
<b>It's a Danger Beast! The air manta!</b>

09:12.440 --> 09:13.820
<b>There's someone on top.</b>

09:14.650 --> 09:16.360
<b>Th-That's...</b>

09:16.780 --> 09:19.240
<b>Former General Najenda!</b>

09:19.580 --> 09:22.040
<b>There appear to be two people with her!</b>

09:22.410 --> 09:24.660
<b>How stylish!</b>

09:24.660 --> 09:27.920
<b>To think their ride would be a
Danger Beast they tamed themselves!</b>

09:27.920 --> 09:30.500
<b>This is no time to get excited!</b>

09:30.500 --> 09:33.420
<b>The divination Relic they have at HQ 
never ceases to impress me.</b>

09:33.420 --> 09:35.590
<b>It foresaw ill fortune for our hideout,</b>

09:35.590 --> 09:36.760
<b>and here we are.</b>

09:37.430 --> 09:39.300
<b>Good thing I came back right away.</b>

09:39.890 --> 09:43.310
<b>Time to unveil our new members.</b>

09:44.230 --> 09:48.150
<b>You caught me off-guard, 
but this works out perfectly.</b>

09:48.520 --> 09:52.070
<b>You can all serve as my guinea pigs!</b>

09:52.650 --> 09:55.110
<b>Time to unveil my secret weapons!{part a ends here}</b>

10:06.120 --> 10:09.960
<b>If I can't take you out in one blow,
I'll just have to cut you down to size.</b>

10:09.960 --> 10:11.460
<b>This is going to hurt.</b>

10:12.040 --> 10:12.840
<b>Prepare yourself.</b>

10:13.880 --> 10:18.430
<b>Pain no longer has any meaning to me!</b>

10:45.660 --> 10:48.540
<b>You coward! How dare you stab me from the sidelines!</b>

10:49.040 --> 10:51.130
<b>My hideout and my comrades are in danger.</b>

10:51.130 --> 10:53.170
<b>I don't intend to just sit by and watch.</b>

10:57.050 --> 11:02.180
<b>Well, I may still have lost even without your interference.</b>

11:03.510 --> 11:07.020
<b>Akame, please tell me...</b>

11:07.020 --> 11:09.730
<b>How was I inferior to you?</b>

11:10.440 --> 11:15.110
<b>Your attacks were vicious, but you were careless.</b>

11:16.030 --> 11:17.030
<b>That's what I think.</b>

11:17.900 --> 11:20.570
<b>So I put too little regard into my own defense.</b>

11:21.740 --> 11:24.990
<b>I suppose this is the downside to not feeling pain.</b>

11:35.460 --> 11:36.920
<b>What is that?</b>

11:37.880 --> 11:38.960
<b>Enemy reinforcements?</b>

11:38.960 --> 11:39.800
<b>Hold on.</b>

11:46.720 --> 11:48.310
<b>It's the boss! We have backup!</b>

11:49.140 --> 11:51.100
<b>Nice timing!</b>

11:51.100 --> 11:51.940
<b>Also, no fair!</b>

11:52.440 --> 11:53.770
<b>What do you mean?</b>

11:53.770 --> 11:56.690
<b>Why does she get to make such a cool entrance?</b>

11:56.690 --> 11:57.940
<b>I want one of those!</b>

11:57.940 --> 11:58.730
<b>Huh?</b>

11:58.730 --> 12:02.240
<b>I've been thinking this for a while, but you have a weird idea of "cool."</b>

12:05.200 --> 12:07.620
<b><i>Oh, you pretty thing...</i></b>

12:10.580 --> 12:12.920
<b><i>Your back's wide open!</i></b>

12:15.420 --> 12:18.300
<b>Now you've made me mad!</b>

12:20.550 --> 12:23.300
<b>What was with that knife out of nowhere?</b>

12:23.300 --> 12:25.430
<b>You knocked me out for a good while!</b>

12:29.100 --> 12:31.230
<b>I can't breathe... Help me...</b>

12:31.230 --> 12:32.810
<b>Let me tell you something.</b>

12:32.810 --> 12:37.230
<b>I like surprise attacks, 
but I <i>hate</i> being on the receiving end.</b>

12:37.230 --> 12:39.070
<b>Looks like you've been augmented.</b>

12:39.070 --> 12:42.150
<b>Don't go thinking that'll 
make your death any easier.</b>

12:47.450 --> 12:50.450
<b><i>Is this what she did last time?</i></b>

12:53.830 --> 12:57.420
<b>Damn, that surprise attack got me good.</b>

12:57.420 --> 13:00.420
<b>Oh, whoops. I killed him already.</b>

13:00.420 --> 13:01.920
<b>L-Leone...</b>

13:02.380 --> 13:04.380
<b>Are you okay?</b>

13:04.380 --> 13:09.470
<b>He caught me off-guard before, but my transformation greatly increases my rate of healing.</b>

13:09.470 --> 13:10.560
<b>This is nothing.</b>

13:11.350 --> 13:12.390
<b>Are you guys all right?</b>

13:12.390 --> 13:13.560
<b>Yeah.</b>

13:13.560 --> 13:15.390
<b>We're all together now.</b>

13:19.860 --> 13:22.400
<b>There's still more?</b>

13:22.400 --> 13:26.030
<b>These are the only ones my wires are detecting.</b>

13:26.700 --> 13:28.910
<b>And I'm not smelling anyone else nearby.</b>

13:28.910 --> 13:32.580
<b>Well then, now that we're all here,
let's finish them off!</b>

13:32.580 --> 13:32.950
<b>Right.</b>

13:36.750 --> 13:37.370
<b>Akame!</b>

13:38.000 --> 13:39.710
<b>What's wrong, guys?</b>

13:39.710 --> 13:42.130
<b>I-I can't...</b>

13:42.800 --> 13:43.800
<b>move...</b>

13:43.800 --> 13:47.720
<b>This is just like back on the ship.</b>

13:47.720 --> 13:49.470
<b>Induced sleep?</b>

13:49.470 --> 13:51.390
<b>No, this is...</b>

13:52.010 --> 13:53.600
<b>poison.</b>

13:55.640 --> 13:59.440
<b>Lord Stylish, looks like it worked on everyone except Incursio's wielder.</b>

14:00.440 --> 14:05.690
<b>Secret weapon #1: my stylishly-
prepared paralyzing poison.</b>

14:06.110 --> 14:08.950
<b>But what about our men?</b>

14:08.950 --> 14:12.030
<b>They've all been administered the antidote.</b>

14:12.030 --> 14:15.750
<b>Seriously? I should have known, 
Lord Stylish! Wow!</b>

14:16.410 --> 14:21.340
<b>I didn't want to use an experimental drug 
on such good test subjects.</b>

14:22.590 --> 14:26.630
<b>The drugs are also valuable, you know. 
They took forever to make.</b>

14:26.630 --> 14:28.590
<b>But what could I do?</b>

14:28.590 --> 14:30.970
<b>Our men were being massacred out there!</b>

14:30.970 --> 14:32.680
<b>You're as thoughtful as ever, Lord Stylish.</b>

14:32.680 --> 14:34.140
<b>Not to mention kind.</b>

14:34.140 --> 14:37.430
<b>And it's unscented, so it's kind to me too!</b>

14:46.490 --> 14:49.820
<b><i>I can still move, at least.</i></b>

14:49.820 --> 14:51.070
<b><i>I have to protect everyone!</i></b>

15:13.300 --> 15:15.680
<b>This guy's on our side, right?</b>

15:17.390 --> 15:21.270
<b>Now, eliminate the enemies before you, Susanoo.</b>

15:21.270 --> 15:22.310
<b>Understood.</b>

15:45.380 --> 15:46.920
<b>D-Damn...</b>

15:47.920 --> 15:51.590
<b>A new enemy's shown up!
And he's destroying our men!</b>

15:51.590 --> 15:54.930
<b>Impossible! The poison works on all living things!</b>

15:55.760 --> 15:58.890
<b>He may have an Imperial Relic that we don't know about yet.</b>

15:59.310 --> 16:04.230
<b>Well, we won't need any more test subjects.</b>

16:11.950 --> 16:14.280
<b>How do you like my custom-made human bombs?</b>

16:14.280 --> 16:16.120
<b>So much for that!</b>

16:28.340 --> 16:30.670
<b>That's... No way...</b>

16:31.510 --> 16:33.050
<b>The new guy...</b>

16:34.130 --> 16:36.300
<b>He's a living Relic!</b>

16:36.680 --> 16:38.350
<b>A humanoid Relic!</b>

16:49.320 --> 16:50.650
<b>Wh-What is it?</b>

16:57.030 --> 16:58.080
<b>There.</b>

16:58.080 --> 16:58.950
<b>Huh?</b>

17:01.620 --> 17:05.210
<b><i>That location would be the perfect place 
to observe the others,</i></b>

17:05.210 --> 17:09.040
<b><i>and what's more, it's upwind from where the poison was spread.</i></b>

17:09.670 --> 17:11.710
<b><i>If someone's coordinating this attack,</i></b>

17:11.710 --> 17:14.220
<b><i>chances are they're somewhere around there.</i></b>

17:18.720 --> 17:19.760
<b><i>Bingo.</i></b>

17:20.140 --> 17:22.850
<b>Susanoo, enemies on the southeast ledge.</b>

17:22.850 --> 17:24.390
<b>Don't let them get away!</b>

17:24.390 --> 17:25.230
<b>Understood.</b>

17:25.770 --> 17:27.230
<b>We've been found!</b>

17:27.230 --> 17:31.190
<b>Oh, well. Let's play it safe and get out of here!</b>

17:31.690 --> 17:34.360
<b><i>My poison won't work on a Relic!</i></b>

17:34.360 --> 17:37.160
<b><i>I have to destroy its core or eliminate the wielder.</i></b>

17:38.910 --> 17:41.490
<b>I guess he won't just let us go, huh?</b>

17:48.830 --> 17:51.340
<b>Fear not, Lord Stylish!</b>

17:51.340 --> 17:53.420
<b>In shogi, we'd be the gold and silver pieces.</b>

17:53.420 --> 17:54.630
<b>We'll protect you, no matter what!</b>

17:55.130 --> 17:58.050
<b><i>No way. You don't stand a chance.</i></b>

17:58.050 --> 18:01.430
<b><i>You're just scouts. You can't defeat him.</i></b>

18:01.430 --> 18:05.310
<b><i>Sounds like it's down to me!</i></b>

18:05.310 --> 18:08.310
<b>Secret weapon #2: Danger Beast extract!</b>

18:08.310 --> 18:09.560
<b>I have no other choice!</b>

18:12.230 --> 18:15.150
<b>Lord... Stylish?</b>

18:16.190 --> 18:19.280
<b>Here it comes!</b>

18:19.280 --> 18:21.620
<b>The ultimate in stylishness!</b>

18:21.620 --> 18:26.960
<b>By transforming into a Danger Beast myself, 
I'll destroy all of you!</b>

18:27.500 --> 18:28.670
<b>How beautiful!</b>

18:28.670 --> 18:30.580
<b>You're amazing, Lord Stylish.</b>

18:31.960 --> 18:35.090
<b>And you three are my precious nourishment!</b>

18:35.960 --> 18:37.970
<b>Let's become one!</b>

18:46.100 --> 18:47.430
<b>Yes, this is it!</b>

18:47.430 --> 18:51.440
<b>I eat the nutritious meat, and I level up!</b>

18:51.440 --> 18:53.520
<b>Wh-What the hell is that?</b>

18:53.980 --> 18:55.230
<b>Gross.</b>

19:02.910 --> 19:04.370
<b>It's a monster.</b>

19:04.910 --> 19:08.330
<b>I'm still not big enough, though.</b>

19:08.330 --> 19:11.290
<b>I'm not even close to the power of the ultimate Relic.</b>

19:12.040 --> 19:16.880
<b>Well then, I'll just have to get even bigger!</b>

19:16.880 --> 19:20.340
<b>And I'll do that by consuming all of you!</b>

19:25.680 --> 19:26.260
<b>He's tough.</b>

19:28.310 --> 19:30.060
<b>Crap. I'd better help out.</b>

19:32.150 --> 19:35.400
<b>Tatsumi, if you can still move, take me with you.</b>

19:36.270 --> 19:37.110
<b>Akame...</b>

19:42.110 --> 19:43.160
<b>Sure!</b>

19:43.160 --> 19:45.160
<b>Hold on tight.</b>

19:45.160 --> 19:46.370
<b>Let's hurry, Akame!</b>

19:53.000 --> 19:55.170
<b>What's wrong, living Relic?</b>

19:55.170 --> 19:56.800
<b>Is that all you've got?</b>

20:06.930 --> 20:09.470
<b>What's this? Two for the price of one?</b>

20:09.470 --> 20:13.100
<b>You look a bit unsteady, so I'll squish you both!</b>

20:20.820 --> 20:21.610
<b>Nice try.</b>
