<b>You should have been more careful while in enemy territory.</b>

03:17.590 --> 03:19.010
<b>She's way too fast—</b>

03:21.720 --> 03:22.390
<b>Damn it!</b>

03:22.800 --> 03:24.640
<b>I'm gonna take you down with me!</b>

03:26.310 --> 03:28.890
<b>Cursed poison from my wound?</b>

03:33.230 --> 03:35.820
<b>One slice, certain death.</b>

03:35.820 --> 03:37.980
<b><i>So much for sneaking in unnoticed.</i></b>

03:38.230 --> 03:41.450
<b><i>But we've confirmed the location of Night Raid's hideout.</i></b>

03:41.450 --> 03:44.070
<b><i>That information alone is worth a great deal!</i></b>

03:47.200 --> 03:49.870
<b>Looks like he's gotten pretty far away.</b>

03:50.250 --> 03:53.330
<b>I don't really like showing myself to the enemy, but...</b>

03:56.250 --> 03:57.920
<b>You're mine!</b>

04:00.210 --> 04:01.760
<b>My apologies.</b>

04:02.010 --> 04:03.720
<b>Thanks, Sheele.</b>

04:04.010 --> 04:05.220
<b>Nice and close.</b>

04:05.220 --> 04:07.720
<b>That kind of danger gives me all the range I need!</b>

04:22.700 --> 04:24.240
<b>Bullseye.</b>

04:24.240 --> 04:28.370
<b>The more trouble I'm in, 
the greater Pumpkin's firepower.</b>

04:28.660 --> 04:29.290
<b>Oh?</b>

04:29.740 --> 04:32.120
<b>That was Mine's Relic, Pumpkin.</b>

04:32.120 --> 04:35.290
<b>I can't believe she goes to the trouble 
of using that thing, really.</b>

04:35.290 --> 04:39.090
<b>With mine, I just go all beast-like 
and beat people up.</b>

04:39.090 --> 04:40.380
<b>Way simpler!</b>

04:41.260 --> 04:43.380
<b>So that's why I felt less 
resistance than I expected.</b>

04:43.380 --> 04:44.880
<b>I snared a girl.</b>

04:45.130 --> 04:47.930
<b>Please, let me go! I'll do anything!</b>

04:48.390 --> 04:49.310
<b>No can do.</b>

04:49.810 --> 04:53.140
<b>I knew someone who died because they fell for a woman's charms.</b>

05:09.080 --> 05:10.990
<b>What a waste.</b>

05:12.080 --> 05:15.330
<b>This job really sucks sometimes.</b>

05:32.560 --> 05:33.220
<b>Bro!</b>

05:39.900 --> 05:41.730
<b>H-He's strong...</b>

05:42.190 --> 05:46.200
<b><i>This is Night Raid's power?</i></b>

05:47.700 --> 05:49.950
<b>So you survived, Tatsumi.</b>

05:51.080 --> 05:52.410
<b>Y-Yeah.</b>

05:52.660 --> 05:55.710
<b>That's good! I've got high hopes for you.</b>

05:58.830 --> 06:00.000
<b>Thanks!</b>

06:15.430 --> 06:16.770
<b><i>Assassins...</i></b>

06:16.770 --> 06:19.350
<b><i>spearheading the revolution.</i></b>

06:19.350 --> 06:20.770
<b><i>That is Night Raid.</i></b>

06:21.520 --> 06:25.110
<b>I joined a pretty amazing group.</b>

06:35.620 --> 06:38.710
<b><i>Why did I just picture Bro's face?</i></b>

06:44.550 --> 06:46.210
<b>This is the capital, right here.</b>

06:46.210 --> 06:48.380
<b>I hear it's surrounded by huge walls</b>

06:48.380 --> 06:50.470
<b>and trade ships sail through the canals.</b>

06:50.470 --> 06:52.010
<b>There's a lot I want to see.</b>

06:52.760 --> 06:55.310
<b>Not to mention all the hot babes!</b>

06:55.310 --> 06:56.220
<b>Yeah!</b>

06:56.220 --> 06:57.680
<b>You creep!</b>

06:57.680 --> 06:59.310
<b>Why just me?</b>

07:02.690 --> 07:05.110
<b><i>Sayo... Ieyasu...</i></b>

07:05.110 --> 07:07.940
<b><i>I'm gonna do my best.</i></b>

07:16.410 --> 07:17.870
<b>Is something the matter?</b>

07:17.870 --> 07:19.790
<b>Oh, Sheele.</b>

07:19.790 --> 07:21.210
<b>Well...</b>

07:21.210 --> 07:24.420
<b>I was told that I'd be working with Mine starting today.</b>

07:24.420 --> 07:26.090
<b>But I'm still waiting for her to show up.</b>

07:26.090 --> 07:29.300
<b>Oh. Mine's not much of a morning person.</b>

07:29.300 --> 07:31.970
<b>What? She can't even wake up for work?</b>

07:31.970 --> 07:33.890
<b>Looks that way.</b>

07:33.890 --> 07:35.640
<b>Shall I rouse her?</b>

07:35.640 --> 07:37.850
<b>No. That is Tatsumi's job.</b>

07:37.850 --> 07:39.390
<b>Why me?!</b>

07:39.390 --> 07:41.520
<b>As of today, you're Mine's subordinate.</b>

07:41.520 --> 07:44.110
<b>And it's a subordinate's duty to fetch his superior.</b>

07:46.440 --> 07:47.320
<b>Fine.</b>

07:49.820 --> 07:52.030
<b>Is that true?</b>

07:52.860 --> 07:54.160
<b>Consider it another trial.</b>

07:54.490 --> 07:55.620
<b>Eh?</b>

07:56.200 --> 07:59.080
<b>Hey, Mine! Hurry and wake up alrea—</b>

08:14.140 --> 08:16.010
<b>A-Are you trying to kill me?!</b>

08:16.010 --> 08:16.720
<b>Obviously!</b>

08:17.050 --> 08:18.760
<b>Why do you think I shot you?!</b>

08:18.760 --> 08:20.980
<b>You've got some nerve jumping out of the way, you perv!</b>

08:21.230 --> 08:22.350
<b>What the hell?</b>

08:22.350 --> 08:26.270
<b>I was told to come wake... you up...</b>

08:26.440 --> 08:29.530
<b>Haven't you ever heard of knocking, you hick?!</b>

08:32.900 --> 08:34.950
<b>What was that? Some kind of festival?</b>

08:34.950 --> 08:36.950
<b>They're really going at it.</b>

08:36.950 --> 08:39.040
<b>Sounds like Tatsumi's got 
his work cut out for him.</b>

08:46.580 --> 08:50.210
<b><i>Now that I look more closely at the capital I admired so much,</i></b>

08:50.210 --> 08:52.420
<b><i>the people here seem so unhappy.</i></b>

08:52.420 --> 08:54.800
<b>Hey, peeping tom!</b>

08:54.800 --> 08:58.100
<b>What's the holdup, hick?</b>

08:58.760 --> 09:01.640
<b>Aren't you supposed to be my minion today?</b>

09:01.640 --> 09:02.390
<b>Minion?</b>

09:02.390 --> 09:03.770
<b>Isn't that what the boss told you?</b>

09:03.770 --> 09:06.400
<b>She just told me to learn from you!</b>

09:06.650 --> 09:08.860
<b>That means you're my minion.</b>

09:08.860 --> 09:10.900
<b>Get moving already.</b>

09:10.900 --> 09:12.150
<b>H-Hey, wai—</b>

09:15.860 --> 09:16.950
<b>Hey, Mine...</b>

09:17.570 --> 09:20.280
<b>Doesn't it seem like lots of 
people here are suffering?</b>

09:20.280 --> 09:23.620
<b>They're living through a recession in an empire ruled by fear.</b>

09:23.620 --> 09:25.750
<b>Only one social segment prospers here.</b>

09:25.750 --> 09:27.710
<b>The rest live in slums.</b>

09:27.710 --> 09:29.090
<b>This is reality.</b>

09:34.760 --> 09:35.970
<b>Hey, what are you guys do—</b>

09:35.970 --> 09:38.510
<b>Stop picking on the weak.</b>

09:39.050 --> 09:40.600
<b>Who the hell are you guys?</b>

09:40.600 --> 09:44.180
<b>This girl is a refugee.</b>

09:44.180 --> 09:46.230
<b>She has to do what we citizens say.</b>

09:46.230 --> 09:47.190
<b>Or what?</b>

09:48.230 --> 09:48.940
<b>Tatsumi?</b>

09:48.940 --> 09:50.110
<b>Right.</b>

10:00.530 --> 10:02.450
<b>U-Um, thank you—</b>

10:02.450 --> 10:04.540
<b>Don't thank me.</b>

10:04.910 --> 10:08.420
<b>You need to learn how to protect yourself.</b>

10:14.090 --> 10:17.550
<b>By the way, is it all right for us to walk around in broad daylight?</b>

10:17.550 --> 10:18.180
<b>Huh?</b>

10:18.180 --> 10:22.260
<b>Well, those four are the only ones whose faces are known.</b>

10:22.560 --> 10:23.850
<b>I see.</b>

10:25.430 --> 10:27.180
<b>Who's the guy in the middle?</b>

10:27.180 --> 10:28.480
<b>Bulat.{you know, like what it kinda says under his face in huge letters}</b>

10:28.480 --> 10:30.400
<b>Oh, Bulat...</b>

10:31.560 --> 10:33.400
<b>B-Bro?</b>

10:33.400 --> 10:35.650
<b>That's what he looked like 
when he was in the military.</b>

10:35.650 --> 10:37.860
<b>He reinvented his image 
after joining Night Raid.</b>

10:40.700 --> 10:42.490
<b>Isn't that going a bit far?</b>

10:44.490 --> 10:47.120
<b>This is like the world's worst "before and after."</b>

10:47.120 --> 10:49.540
<b>Anyway, they haven't identified either of us yet,</b>

10:49.540 --> 10:51.130
<b>which is why we've been sent here.</b>

10:51.130 --> 10:51.790
<b>Got it?</b>

10:52.040 --> 10:53.340
<b>Bring it on!</b>

10:53.340 --> 10:55.300
<b>That's why you brought me, right?</b>

10:55.300 --> 10:58.420
<b>Okay, let's begin our cultural investigation of the capital!</b>

10:58.420 --> 11:01.260
<b>I'm not sure what you mean, but sure!</b>

11:19.700 --> 11:21.410
<b>What a haul!</b>

11:21.410 --> 11:24.410
<b>Pink clothes really are the best spring wear.</b>

11:24.410 --> 11:25.490
<b>Right.</b>

11:25.490 --> 11:28.200
<b>We have to stretch our wings on our days off.</b>

11:28.200 --> 11:29.160
<b>Right.</b>

11:29.910 --> 11:31.920
<b>All right, mission complete!</b>

11:31.920 --> 11:34.540
<b>The hell? This was just shopping!</b>

11:35.040 --> 11:36.250
<b>Insolence!</b>

11:37.800 --> 11:40.220
<b>I'm your superior here, 
and you're the subordinate.</b>

11:40.220 --> 11:41.880
<b>You have no business talking back.</b>

11:42.680 --> 11:45.680
<b>Be grateful I gave you the chance to carry my shopping!</b>

11:46.140 --> 11:48.640
<b>You're only my superior 
for as long as I'm training!</b>

11:48.640 --> 11:50.640
<b>Not that this even counts as training!</b>

11:50.640 --> 11:51.850
<b>Huh?</b>

11:51.850 --> 11:54.900
<b>You really thought we'd be 
on equal terms just like that?</b>

11:54.900 --> 11:57.690
<b>Sounds like you're confident in your swordsmanship.</b>

12:00.030 --> 12:03.110
<b>But you haven't fought anywhere close to as many battles as me.</b>

12:03.700 --> 12:04.660
<b>I know.</b>

12:05.870 --> 12:10.620
<b>I know I'm not experienced enough.</b>

12:11.120 --> 12:11.870
<b>But...</b>

12:12.210 --> 12:14.390
<b>I still have to keep moving forward.</b>

12:14.390 --> 12:16.090
<b>For Sayo and Ieyasu's sake!</b>

12:18.250 --> 12:19.170
<b>Hmph.</b>

12:19.170 --> 12:22.220
<b>It seems Akame and Bulat 
have high hopes for you,</b>

12:22.220 --> 12:23.590
<b>but I'm not so sure.</b>

12:27.140 --> 12:28.600
<b>What's the commotion?</b>

12:28.600 --> 12:30.140
<b>Probably a public execution.</b>

12:30.390 --> 12:32.480
<b>They're a common sight here in the capital.</b>

12:45.860 --> 12:47.740
<b>This is terrible.</b>

12:48.370 --> 12:51.330
<b>The prime minister has no qualms about disposing of those who oppose him.</b>

12:51.750 --> 12:55.670
<b>His plotting ensured that the current young emperor won the battle for succession.</b>

12:55.670 --> 12:56.670
<b>But...</b>

12:57.630 --> 12:59.380
<b>He won't get me.</b>

13:01.760 --> 13:04.340
<b>I'm going to survive this revolution and come out on top.</b>

13:07.050 --> 13:09.100
<b><i>A crafty prime minister?</i></b>

13:09.100 --> 13:12.140
<b><i>What kind of person could do this?</i></b>

13:21.780 --> 13:23.820
<b>Domestic Affairs Official Shoui,</b>

13:23.820 --> 13:28.070
<b>for speaking against my policies 
and delaying government affairs,</b>

13:28.070 --> 13:30.450
<b>you are sentenced to be 
drawn and quartered by bulls.</b>

13:33.620 --> 13:35.580
<b>This is what needs to be done, 
right, Prime Minister?</b>

13:37.920 --> 13:39.790
<b>Well done, Your Highness.</b>

13:39.790 --> 13:43.300
<b>Truly, you are the wisest of rulers.</b>

13:43.550 --> 13:46.430
<b>Meat again? You sure eat a lot.</b>

13:47.590 --> 13:50.300
<b>Life's pleasures are best enjoyed 
when they are fresh.</b>

13:50.640 --> 13:52.260
<b>Buono, buono.</b>

13:53.100 --> 13:56.020
<b>Your Highness! The prime minister is deceiving you!</b>

13:56.020 --> 14:00.480
<b>Please, open your ears to your peoples' cries!</b>

14:00.480 --> 14:03.650
<b>Prime Minister, is this true?</b>

14:03.650 --> 14:06.320
<b>He has clearly gone mad, Your Highness.</b>

14:06.320 --> 14:10.370
<b>Right! You've never been wrong before, after all!</b>

14:12.080 --> 14:13.490
<b>Sir Shoui.</b>

14:14.580 --> 14:16.370
<b>I regretfully bid you farewell.</b>

14:16.370 --> 14:17.500
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

14:17.500 --> 14:20.500
<b>What of our empire's glorious 1,000-year history?!</b>

14:23.960 --> 14:25.130
<b>Sir Shoui,</b>

14:26.170 --> 14:31.800
<b>don't worry about that beautiful wife you're leaving behind.</b>

14:31.800 --> 14:34.310
<b>I'll take good care of her...</b>

14:35.220 --> 14:37.430
<b>in every possible way.</b>

14:40.440 --> 14:43.150
<b>How... How can this happen?</b>

14:43.610 --> 14:46.240
<b>How can this be allowed?</b>

14:46.240 --> 14:49.570
<b>Every crime cries out for punishment.</b>

14:49.570 --> 14:52.030
<b>Someone, please...</b>

14:52.370 --> 14:56.950
<b>Please deliver justice upon this demon!</b>

14:58.210 --> 15:00.420
<b>We've just received a new assignment.</b>

15:00.420 --> 15:04.880
<b>The target, Iokal, is distantly related to Prime Minister Honest.</b>

15:05.250 --> 15:10.050
<b>He uses the prime minister's name to 
kidnap women and beat them to death.</b>

15:10.050 --> 15:14.600
<b>His five guards participate in this brutality, 
so they too are guilty.</b>

15:14.600 --> 15:16.100
<b>This mission is vital,</b>

15:16.560 --> 15:18.060
<b>so I'm sending all of you.</b>

15:19.640 --> 15:22.480
<b>So that's Iokal's mansion.</b>

15:23.020 --> 15:24.520
<b>It's huge.</b>

15:25.570 --> 15:26.150
<b>Hey.</b>

15:26.150 --> 15:27.400
<b>What?</b>

15:27.400 --> 15:29.150
<b>Is that another of those Imperial Relics?</b>

15:29.150 --> 15:31.450
<b>Yeah, Imperial Relic Pumpkin.</b>

15:31.860 --> 15:35.240
<b>The more trouble its user is in, 
the more its destructive power.</b>

15:35.910 --> 15:39.500
<b>Not like I'm ever really in trouble, though.</b>

15:39.500 --> 15:42.460
<b>How is it possible to make something like that?</b>

15:42.460 --> 15:44.750
<b>Imperial Relics are powerful, ancient pieces of equipment.</b>

15:44.750 --> 15:47.250
<b>The methods of their creation 
have been all but lost.</b>

15:47.250 --> 15:49.880
<b>You're a real stickler for details, aren't you?</b>

15:52.970 --> 15:55.430
<b>It should be easy enough at this distance.{like shooting fish in a barrel amirite}</b>

15:55.430 --> 15:58.390
<b>As soon as he leaves his mansion, 
I'll shoot him right between the eyes.</b>

15:58.390 --> 16:02.440
<b>All right! And then it's my job 
to escort you out of here.</b>

16:02.440 --> 16:03.150
<b>You can count on me!</b>

16:03.650 --> 16:04.900
<b>Hmph.</b>

16:04.900 --> 16:06.150
<b>I'm not expecting much.</b>

16:14.910 --> 16:16.870
<b><i>Her concentration is amazing.</i></b>

16:16.870 --> 16:19.200
<b><i>I can feel it all the way from here.</i></b>

16:19.200 --> 16:19.870
<b>Here he comes.</b>

16:20.250 --> 16:21.250
<b>Huh?</b>

16:21.250 --> 16:22.290
<b>Where?</b>

16:24.210 --> 16:27.000
<b>There are a whole lot of bystanders with him, though.</b>

16:27.000 --> 16:28.170
<b>So what?</b>

16:28.170 --> 16:29.590
<b>What do you mean, "so what"?</b>

16:29.590 --> 16:31.170
<b>How are you going to shoot him?</b>

16:31.170 --> 16:32.670
<b>They don't matter.</b>

16:32.670 --> 16:34.090
<b>They don't matter?</b>

16:34.090 --> 16:36.390
<b>Surely you wouldn't kill innocent pe—</b>

16:44.650 --> 16:47.560
<b>I'm a master sniper, you know.</b>

16:48.070 --> 16:50.570
<b>Find Lord Iokal's killer at once!</b>

16:50.900 --> 16:53.650
<b>If they get away, the prime minister will have our heads!</b>

16:53.650 --> 16:55.530
<b>They couldn't have gone far!</b>

16:57.990 --> 16:59.410
<b>Here they are.</b>

16:59.410 --> 17:03.370
<b>Time to go wild!</b>

17:05.370 --> 17:09.460
<b>Ugh... This other route is really hard to traverse.</b>

17:09.460 --> 17:11.050
<b>You think they got rid of our pursuers?</b>

17:11.760 --> 17:15.010
<b>All the guards around here have trained at Koukenji.</b>

17:15.010 --> 17:16.890
<b>It probably won't be that easy.</b>

17:15.680 --> 17:20.470
Kou

17:15.680 --> 17:20.470
Kou

17:15.680 --> 17:20.470
kenji

17:15.680 --> 17:20.470
kenji

17:16.890 --> 17:20.470
<b>Koukenji... The empire's top martial arts temple.</b>

17:20.810 --> 17:24.480
<b>I guess they don't skimp on the security for the prime minister's relatives.</b>

17:24.480 --> 17:28.730
<b>People who abuse power they were born 
into piss me off more than anything else.</b>

17:32.110 --> 17:33.690
<b><i>I wonder what happened in her past.</i></b>

17:35.320 --> 17:38.660
<b>As a special treat, I'll tell you 
a little about my past.</b>

17:38.660 --> 17:39.910
<b><i>I didn't even have to ask!</i></b>

17:42.580 --> 17:45.620
<b>I grew up near the western border of the empire.</b>

17:46.460 --> 17:48.670
<b>And I'm half-foreigner.</b>

17:49.000 --> 17:51.130
<b>Everyone in the city looked down upon me.</b>

17:51.750 --> 17:54.630
<b>I wasn't accepted, no matter where I went.</b>

17:55.510 --> 17:57.880
<b>It was a tragic childhood indeed.</b>

17:58.970 --> 18:00.010
<b>However...</b>

18:00.010 --> 18:04.020
<b>The Revolutionary Army is allied with the foreigners to the west.</b>

18:04.020 --> 18:08.600
<b>Once the capital has a new ruler, borders will be opened and nationality will no longer matter.</b>

18:08.600 --> 18:12.940
<b>That way, no one else will 
have to go through what I did.</b>

18:13.280 --> 18:16.450
<b>I won't let anyone be 
discriminated against ever again!</b>

18:17.740 --> 18:18.780
<b>Mine...</b>

18:19.490 --> 18:26.120
<b>And then I'll get rich off my role in 
the revolution and live a life of luxury!</b>

18:31.630 --> 18:33.380
<b>That was great stress relief!</b>

18:33.840 --> 18:35.550
<b>They were quite strong.</b>

18:35.960 --> 18:37.470
<b>Something's off.</b>

18:37.470 --> 18:39.970
<b>There should have been five guards.</b>

18:40.300 --> 18:43.560
<b>Yeah, you four took one each and left me with nothing.</b>

18:43.560 --> 18:45.720
<b>That means you only get half the reward, Lubb.</b>

18:45.720 --> 18:46.600
<b>What?!</b>

18:46.600 --> 18:49.310
<b>That's not fair!</b>

18:47.520 --> 18:49.310
<b>'Cos you're just half a man.</b>

18:53.270 --> 18:54.440
<b>Tatsumi...</b>

18:57.900 --> 18:59.860
<b>This is where we're supposed to regroup.</b>

18:59.860 --> 19:01.370
<b>Mission complete.</b>

19:01.700 --> 19:03.830
<b>It's not complete until we turn in our report.</b>

19:04.620 --> 19:05.950
<b>Did you get that from Akame?</b>

19:09.000 --> 19:09.370
<b>Look out!</b>

19:09.370 --> 19:09.710
<b>He—</b>

19:12.000 --> 19:12.790
<b>Tatsumi!</b>

19:12.790 --> 19:14.250
<b>Wh-Why you...</b>

19:14.540 --> 19:17.420
<b>Not bad, if I do say so myself.</b>

19:17.420 --> 19:19.260
<b>You must be a Koukenji martial artist.</b>

19:19.630 --> 19:22.550
<b>Precisely. I used to be an instructor, in fact.</b>

19:22.550 --> 19:24.300
<b>That was ten years ago, though.</b>

19:24.600 --> 19:27.060
<b>And now you're stuck with guard duty?</b>

19:27.060 --> 19:29.560
<b>How the mighty have fallen!</b>

19:29.560 --> 19:31.520
<b>I got kicked out for an indiscretion or two.</b>

19:35.520 --> 19:38.070
<b>I'll have a little fun before I hand you over to the prime minister.</b>

19:38.070 --> 19:39.030
<b>Hope you're prepared!</b>

19:39.860 --> 19:41.280
<b>Don't make me laugh.</b>

19:48.580 --> 19:50.580
<b>Now, Mine! Shoot him!</b>

19:51.120 --> 19:52.540
<b>Tatsumi...</b>

19:53.080 --> 19:55.460
<b>You're throwing away your life for me!</b>

19:55.460 --> 19:57.090
<b>No, I'm not, you idiot!</b>

19:57.090 --> 19:59.460
<b>You're a master sniper, right?</b>

19:59.460 --> 20:00.550
<b>I believe in you.</b>

20:03.550 --> 20:04.510
<b>You little...</b>

20:04.510 --> 20:05.890
<b>Let go, damn it!</b>

20:05.890 --> 20:06.720
<b>Hurry!</b>

20:07.470 --> 20:09.390
<b>Big words for a newbie.</b>

20:09.930 --> 20:12.060
<b>All right, I'll do it!</b>

20:12.560 --> 20:13.310
<b>Wait!</b>

20:34.420 --> 20:35.630
<b>You bastards...</b>

20:35.630 --> 20:37.250
<b>Don't think you'll get away...</b>

20:37.250 --> 20:41.420
<b>with killing the prime minister's relatives...</b>

20:49.600 --> 20:53.270
<b>You've got some guts.</b>

20:53.560 --> 20:55.770
<b>I guess I can accept you as one of us. For now—</b>

20:56.190 --> 20:58.940
<b>That bullet came way too close.</b>

20:59.270 --> 21:02.190
<b>Look what you did to my head!</b>

21:03.400 --> 21:04.530
<b>What?!</b>

21:04.530 --> 21:06.660
<b>I said I'd accept you and everything!</b>

21:06.660 --> 21:07.450
<b>Shut up!</b>

21:07.450 --> 21:08.830
<b>You're no master sniper!</b>

21:08.830 --> 21:09.980
<b>You're not even competent!</b>

21:09.370 --> 21:12.120
<b>Guess we didn't need to rush over here after all.</b>

21:09.980 --> 21:12.120
<b>What? Of course I am!</b>

21:12.120 --> 21:14.960
<b>Actual masters don't call themselves that, for one!</b>

21:14.960 --> 21:16.080
<b>What was that?!</b>

21:15.420 --> 21:16.080
<b>You stupid idiot!</b>

21:19.540 --> 21:21.630
<b>Just like me.</b>

21:21.630 --> 21:25.510
<b>A Relic-wielder... An assassin...</b>

21:26.550 --> 21:28.600
<b>Splendid. Simply splendid.</b>

21:28.600 --> 21:30.760
<b>To think someone like her is running amok out there.</b>

21:31.010 --> 21:32.890
<b>Hey, you!</b>

21:32.890 --> 21:35.440
<b>You look suspicious. Freeze!</b>

21:42.690 --> 21:47.530
<b>It appears that the capital is 
a very comfortable place to live.</b>

21:48.110 --> 21:51.910
<b>With so many people, 
I can cut down as many as I want!</b>

21:51.910 --> 21:55.000
<b>Splendid. Simply splendid!</b>

22:06.030 --> 22:11.740
utsuro na me wo shite

22:06.030 --> 22:11.740
Your eyes look empty

22:11.740 --> 22:15.170
nani wo tsutaetai no

22:11.740 --> 22:15.170
What is it you want to say

22:17.260 --> 22:26.330
ukande wa kiete iku anata no zanzou

22:17.260 --> 22:26.330
Your after-image  floats away and disappears into nothingness

22:28.120 --> 22:33.220
hikitomenaide sono yasashisatte douse

22:28.120 --> 22:33.220
Please don't hold me back

22:33.220 --> 22:37.680
musekinin yo shitteru

22:33.220 --> 22:37.680
I know your kindness lacks any responsibility

22:38.690 --> 22:44.010
tsuyoku nakya atashi wa ikiru imi mo nai

22:38.690 --> 22:44.010
If I can't be stronger, I have no reason to live

22:44.010 --> 22:48.740
isso kowashite yo

22:44.010 --> 22:48.740
So just break me already

22:50.660 --> 22:55.970
itoshisa de kokoro wa moroku nari

22:50.660 --> 22:55.970
Love makes my heart grow brittle

22:55.970 --> 23:01.440
nigiritsubuseru hodo yasashikutte

22:55.970 --> 23:01.440
So gentle it threatens to crush it

23:01.440 --> 23:11.750
dare ni mo mise ta koto nai yowa sa ga hitotsu dake kobore ta

23:01.440 --> 23:11.750
Of the weaknesses I've never shown anyone, one has come tumbling out

23:13.060 --> 23:17.940
donna itami mo gaman dekita no yo

23:13.060 --> 23:17.940
I've persevered through every sort of pain

23:17.940 --> 23:23.910
shiritaku nanka nakatta

23:17.940 --> 23:23.910
And I wish I'd never known any of it

23:34.350 --> 23:40.020
Kill   the   Relic-Wielder

23:34.350 --> 23:40.020
Kill   the   Relic-Wielder

23:34.350 --> 23:40.020
Kill   the   Relic-Wielder
