00:07.320 --> 00:09.020
<b>This is a trap.</b>

00:09.020 --> 00:11.530
<b>That much is obvious.</b>

00:11.530 --> 00:15.110
<b>But I can't stand by and let Tatsumi die!</b>

00:16.220 --> 00:17.590
<b>You've changed, Mine.</b>

00:18.360 --> 00:20.620
<b>Back then, you were the one stopping me.</b>

00:20.970 --> 00:24.040
<b>Don't do something stupid like

00:24.760 --> 00:28.860
<b>I think it's the way I see Tatsumi that's changed.</b>

00:28.860 --> 00:30.090
<b>I'm going too.</b>

00:30.950 --> 00:33.450
<b>There's no point putting both of us in danger!</b>

<b>Are you stupid?</b>

00:34.180 --> 00:35.390
<b>You're the one being stupid.</b>

00:36.690 --> 00:40.520
<b>If we work together, 
we have a better chance of survival.</b>

00:44.290 --> 00:47.520
<b>You've gotten a lot softer as well, you know?</b>

00:48.020 --> 00:49.980

00:51.050 --> 00:53.500
<b>Hmph! Fine!</b>

00:53.500 --> 00:54.920

00:54.920 --> 00:56.260
<b>That settles it, then.</b>

<b>Leone?</b>

00:58.440 --> 01:02.810
<b>I was the one who scouted him out, after all.</b>

01:02.810 --> 01:06.960
<b>Letting one of my recruits get executed would be terrible for my reputation.{literally skiddiks}</b>

<b>Huh? You wanna come too?</b>

01:09.520 --> 01:12.430
<b>That's how it is, Boss. Don't try to stop us.</b>

01:12.430 --> 01:14.680
<b>Who said I was going to stop you?</b>

01:14.680 --> 01:15.340
<b>Boss?</b>

01:15.770 --> 01:20.810
<b>If this public execution is meant to lower the Revolutionary Army's morale,</b>

01:20.810 --> 01:24.010
<b>it's our duty to prevent it.</b>

01:24.010 --> 01:29.050
<b>Furthermore, Tatsumi's Incursio will be indispensable for the final battle.</b>

01:29.990 --> 01:31.480
<b>That's not the only reason, is it, Boss?</b>

01:33.460 --> 01:34.320
<b>Well, never mind.</b>

01:35.210 --> 01:36.950
<b>This is an emergency Night Raid mission.</b>

<b>For the sake of our fallen brethren, we must succeed.</b>

<b>However, there is no need to lend your ears

<b>Wait for me, Tatsumi!</b>

12:13.120 --> 12:14.040
<b>Freeze.</b>

12:20.550 --> 12:21.260
<b>Susanoo!</b>

12:22.380 --> 12:25.720
<b>I respected you as a general,</b>

12:26.260 --> 12:27.390
<b>but is this all you had?</b>

12:28.010 --> 12:31.020
<b>With Esdeath as my opponent, 
I should have done this from the very start.</b>

12:32.390 --> 12:33.600
<b>Magatama Manifestation!</b>

12:39.360 --> 12:40.570
<b>What are you doing?</b>

12:41.110 --> 12:43.450
<b>Why do you think we've survived this long?</b>

12:43.450 --> 12:45.070
<b>We're a tough bunch.</b>

12:45.070 --> 12:48.700
<b>Never lower your guard, even if your opponent's completely encased in ice.</b>

12:49.700 --> 12:51.330
<b>Go, Susanoo!</b>

12:52.160 --> 12:54.250
<b>Defeat Esdeath!</b>

12:55.710 --> 12:58.040
<b>So this is your hidden ability. How interesting.</b>

13:02.460 --> 13:05.260
<b>However, you still cannot defeat me.</b>

13:05.260 --> 13:07.220
<b>I'll smash you to pieces, core included!</b>

13:08.100 --> 13:09.930
<b>Yata-no-Kagami!</b>

13:14.730 --> 13:15.980
<b>She's as strong as I thought.</b>

13:18.440 --> 13:19.820
<b>You lightning-spouting geezer!</b>

13:19.820 --> 13:21.280
<b>Mine, get away from him!</b>

13:21.280 --> 13:23.240
<b>It's all right, Tatsumi!</b>

13:23.240 --> 13:27.990
<b>Snatching victory from the jaws of defeat is my specialty! I'll save you soon!</b>

13:27.990 --> 13:29.200
<b>I see.</b>

13:29.200 --> 13:32.910
<b>So that brash nature of yours powers your Relic,</b>

13:32.910 --> 13:36.870
<b>and its battle power boosts your confidence in return.</b>

13:37.290 --> 13:38.580
<b>Take this!</b>

13:40.340 --> 13:42.760
<b>But you cannot defeat me.</b>

13:42.760 --> 13:44.760
<b>I'll make you eat those words!</b>

13:51.560 --> 13:53.020
<b>Mine!</b>

13:53.720 --> 13:55.770
<b>I'm all right, Tatsumi.</b>

13:56.390 --> 13:58.020
<b>Did you forget?</b>

13:58.020 --> 14:01.520
<b>I told you I'd survive this revolution and come out on top.</b>

14:02.230 --> 14:05.900
<b>When it comes to my and Pumpkin's power...</b>

14:10.570 --> 14:11.620
<b>you've seen nothing yet!</b>

14:14.370 --> 14:16.120
<b>How pitiful.</b>

14:16.120 --> 14:17.830
<b>Let me put you out of your misery.</b>

14:19.420 --> 14:21.290
<b>No need to pity me.</b>

14:24.130 --> 14:29.340
<b>We're all going to leave this place together,</b>

14:29.800 --> 14:30.930
<b>no matter what!</b>

14:30.930 --> 14:35.890
<b>Feel the wrath of my Imperial Relic Adramelech's ultimate technique!</b>

<b>Not good!</b>

14:46.070 --> 14:46.690

14:50.660 --> 14:53.030
<b><i>Pumpkin, I'm begging you.</i></b>

14:53.030 --> 14:54.910
<b><i>Respond to me!</i></b>

14:55.240 --> 14:56.660

<b>Wh-What?</b>

17:01.950 --> 17:03.210
<b>What happened?</b>

17:03.710 --> 17:06.380
<b>I froze time and space itself.</b>

17:06.380 --> 17:10.130
<b>I developed this ability not only to prevent Tatsumi from ever escaping me again</b>

18:29.920 --> 18:32.130
<b>He's simply pushed himself far beyond his limits.</b>

<b>Susanoo's actual strength hasn't increased.</b>

18:36.510 --> 18:39.840

<b>You're not getting away!</b>

<b><i>A mirror that reflects attacks?</i></b>

19:25.350 --> 19:27.180
<b>I won't let you pursue them.</b>

<b>So you would sacrifice yourself

<b>It seems all of Najenda's subordinates are too compassionate.</b>
