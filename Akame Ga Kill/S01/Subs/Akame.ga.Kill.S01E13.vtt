03:24.550 --> 03:25.390
<b>Let's hear it.</b>

03:26.930 --> 03:30.600
<b>I'd like you to capture and suppress the new Danger Beasts</b>

03:30.600 --> 03:32.730
<b>that have appeared around the capital.</b>

03:33.020 --> 03:34.310
<b>Ah, that.</b>

03:35.020 --> 03:37.610
<b>I've been looking into that matter myself.</b>

03:38.440 --> 03:42.660
<b>At first, they appeared only in dense forests and mines.</b>

03:42.660 --> 03:43.820
<b>But the other day,</b>

03:43.820 --> 03:47.450
<b>they evidently forced their way into a house 
and then killed and ate the residents.</b>

03:47.450 --> 03:48.910
<b>Exactly.</b>

03:48.910 --> 03:52.710
<b>I heard they resemble humans pretty closely.</b>

03:52.710 --> 03:56.090
<b>Don't you think they sound like amusing toys?</b>

03:57.170 --> 04:01.340
<b>Commander-in-Chief Budo
has ordered us to eradicate them,</b>

04:01.340 --> 04:03.380
<b>but I'd definitely like to study a few.</b>

04:03.890 --> 04:05.260
<b>Very well.</b>

04:05.930 --> 04:08.850
<b>I've heard they're ferocious, so I've been meaning to keep some for myself.</b>

04:09.600 --> 04:12.230
<b>I'll bring a few back alive.</b>

04:12.230 --> 04:16.440
<b>You can send my reward money to the troops I left up north.</b>

04:16.440 --> 04:20.740
<b>I see you're looking out for
your subordinates as usual.</b>

04:22.110 --> 04:26.620
<b>The more I nurture their devotion, the more willing they are to put their lives on the line for me.</b>

04:26.620 --> 04:31.750
<b>That's one of the reasons my army is so powerful.</b>

04:33.920 --> 04:35.670
<b>How promising.</b>

04:35.670 --> 04:39.050
<b>Bring back some lively ones, if you will.</b>

04:40.050 --> 04:43.050
<b>Let's hurry up and enter
the capital while it's still light.</b>

04:43.050 --> 04:44.180
<b>You don't have to tell me.</b>

04:44.180 --> 04:46.890
<b>The less time we spend
out here in danger, the better.</b>

04:50.220 --> 04:51.600
<b>Th-There they are!</b>

04:57.560 --> 04:58.440
<b>Just in time.</b>

05:01.030 --> 05:03.860
<b>This should finish you!</b>

05:15.370 --> 05:17.830
<b>You're safe now, my friends.</b>

05:19.630 --> 05:22.090
<b>Uh, the Danger Beasts are gone.</b>

05:22.800 --> 05:27.760
<b>There's no need to look so afraid.</b>

05:29.100 --> 05:31.180
<b>It's all right now.</b>

05:31.180 --> 05:33.470
<b>The evildoers have been devoured by the flames of justice!</b>

05:35.350 --> 05:37.770
<b>You must be soldiers from the capital.</b>

05:37.770 --> 05:38.810
<b>That's a relief.</b>

05:39.610 --> 05:42.020
<b>Uh, you know...</b>

05:42.650 --> 05:44.150
<b>Don't take it personally, Bols.</b>

05:44.780 --> 05:47.280
<b>Those people...</b>

05:47.660 --> 05:50.280
<b>seem to have calmed down! Thank goodness!</b>

06:03.550 --> 06:05.050
<b>Just as planned.</b>

06:06.220 --> 06:09.010
<b>I've trapped the ones that ran away in my ice.</b>

06:10.430 --> 06:14.470
<b>I see. This is indeed a type I've never seen before.</b>

06:20.060 --> 06:21.190
<b>They're not for eating.{wtf what's wrong with her}</b>

06:25.780 --> 06:28.450
<b>Wave, Kurome, the tea's ready.</b>

06:28.450 --> 06:29.910
<b>Thanks.</b>

06:29.910 --> 06:32.120
<b>Yeah, thanks for always doing this for us.</b>

06:32.120 --> 06:34.910
<b>No problem at all. I enjoy it.</b>

06:37.620 --> 06:38.960
<b>What's the matter, Wave?</b>

06:39.540 --> 06:41.540
<b>It just makes me angry.</b>

06:41.540 --> 06:43.880
<b>You're a nice guy, Bols.</b>

06:43.880 --> 06:46.920
<b>And yet, those merchants you saved back there...</b>

06:46.920 --> 06:48.930
<b>Everyone judges you by your appearance!</b>

06:49.300 --> 06:50.680
<b>Like you can talk.</b>

06:50.680 --> 06:51.430
<b>Huh?</b>

06:52.930 --> 06:54.810
<b>Oh, right!</b>

06:55.850 --> 07:00.480
<b>Wave, I've said this before,
but I'm not nice at all.</b>

07:01.850 --> 07:06.400
<b>I razed an entire village to the ground to stop a plague from spreading.</b>

07:07.030 --> 07:11.530
<b>I was even ordered to execute someone who proclaimed their innocence the whole time.</b>

07:13.530 --> 07:14.740
<b>So...</b>

07:15.410 --> 07:19.120
<b>I must bear the enmity of countless people.</b>

07:19.120 --> 07:21.960
<b>But you were just following orders as a soldier!</b>

07:21.960 --> 07:25.880
<b>I know it was my job, but karma is karma.</b>

07:27.050 --> 07:31.590
<b>The fear and scorn I receive from
those I save is the penance I must pay.</b>

07:31.970 --> 07:34.180
<b>You're too hard on yourself, Bols!</b>

07:34.800 --> 07:36.890
<b>I'd be more than happy to lend an ear—</b>

07:36.890 --> 07:37.680
<b>Honey!</b>

07:38.980 --> 07:40.480
<b>Daddy!</b>

07:41.020 --> 07:41.770
<b>What's this?</b>

07:42.690 --> 07:44.360
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

07:44.360 --> 07:48.480
<b>Well, you forgot the lunch we made together.</b>

07:48.480 --> 07:50.240
<b>Oh, how could I?</b>

07:50.240 --> 07:52.700
<b>You're so silly, Daddy!</b>

07:55.120 --> 07:57.200
<b>Since your job is so demanding,</b>

07:57.200 --> 07:59.370
<b>you need to be sure to keep up your strength.</b>

08:00.040 --> 08:02.710
<b>Right! I'll be more careful.</b>

08:03.040 --> 08:05.000
<b>Daddy! Gimme a ride!</b>

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
<b>There, there. That's a good girl.</b>

08:08.840 --> 08:10.510
<b>Thank you, Wave.</b>

08:12.220 --> 08:16.470
<b>My wife and daughter know everything I've done,</b>

08:16.470 --> 08:18.850
<b>but they've always been there for me.</b>

08:19.140 --> 08:21.100
<b>That's why,</b>

08:21.600 --> 08:24.020
<b>no matter how hard things get, I'll be just fine.{all these death flags}</b>

08:24.020 --> 08:27.060
<b>I-It's blinding! Is this love?</b>

08:27.570 --> 08:31.030
<b>So basically, I'm useless again.</b>

08:33.990 --> 08:35.280
<b>Oh, you.</b>

08:54.130 --> 08:57.010
<b>Don't just blindly apply your full strength.</b>

09:08.810 --> 09:13.030
<b>No matter how sturdy something may appear, 
it will usually have a weakness.</b>

09:13.650 --> 09:15.360
<b>Wow...</b>

09:16.320 --> 09:20.280
<b>If you can discover that weakness in battle, 
it will benefit you greatly.</b>

09:20.280 --> 09:21.040
<b>Looks like it.</b>

09:21.870 --> 09:26.120
<b>But I wonder if I'll be able
to pull that off in an actual battle.</b>

09:26.540 --> 09:29.290
<b>I can't help but do so unconsciously.</b>

09:29.290 --> 09:31.550
<b>You must be a natural, Su.</b>

09:31.960 --> 09:35.930
<b>My purpose as an Imperial Relic is to guard my master.</b>

09:35.930 --> 09:38.760
<b>As such, I must be able to spot
even the slightest irregularities.</b>

09:39.220 --> 09:42.680
<b>I understand. That's reassuring.</b>

09:42.680 --> 09:48.400
<b>With you around, I feel like the 
eight of us can survive anything!{pls tatsumi no}</b>

09:49.020 --> 09:50.650
<b>I'm an Imperial Relic.</b>

09:50.650 --> 09:53.110
<b>There is no need to count me as a person.</b>

09:53.110 --> 09:54.190
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

09:54.740 --> 09:56.530
<b>You're our comrade!</b>

09:57.740 --> 10:00.320
<b>Comrade?</b>

10:01.700 --> 10:03.990
<b>I don't really understand.</b>

10:03.990 --> 10:06.210
<b>To be your comrade means
to fight alongside you, right?</b>

10:06.210 --> 10:10.330
<b>Huh? Well, yeah, but...</b>

10:12.090 --> 10:14.670
<b>We also help each other out.</b>

10:14.670 --> 10:15.550
<b>I know!</b>

10:15.970 --> 10:17.970
<b>Su, you're really good-looking,</b>

10:17.970 --> 10:21.970
<b>so you should help Lubb and me when we go pick up chicks.</b>

10:23.260 --> 10:24.390
<b>I don't really understand, but...</b>

10:25.810 --> 10:29.850
<b>If that's what you wish, 
I will do whatever I can to help.{inb4 he shows up with an armful of young poultry}</b>

10:29.850 --> 10:30.810
<b>Okay!</b>

10:31.360 --> 10:33.270
<b>Su! Tatsumi!</b>

10:35.030 --> 10:37.780
<b>We've received an emergency summons. Hurry back.</b>

10:38.700 --> 10:40.610
<b>Huh? What emergency?</b>

10:40.610 --> 10:43.030
<b>Danger Beasts have appeared around the capital,</b>

10:43.030 --> 10:44.660
<b>throwing the people into disarray.</b>

10:45.240 --> 10:49.620
<b>We're to eradicate them en route to our new hideout.</b>

10:51.000 --> 10:52.590
<b>The capital, huh?{end of part a}</b>

10:59.880 --> 11:01.010
<b>You know...</b>

11:01.640 --> 11:04.510
<b>This doesn't really feel like a new hideout at all.</b>

11:05.010 --> 11:07.680
<b>We sought out another hard-to-find and easy-to-escape place,</b>

11:07.680 --> 11:10.270
<b>so it's only natural that it should be similar.</b>

11:10.270 --> 11:13.690
<b>Well, it'll be nice to have a hot spring again.</b>

11:13.690 --> 11:16.320
<b>When we're done with work, 
let's meet up there for a drink.</b>

11:16.320 --> 11:17.610
<b>Sounds good!</b>

11:17.610 --> 11:19.700
<b>Najenda!</b>

11:20.240 --> 11:23.070
<b>I've finished setting up a detection perimeter around the base.</b>

11:23.070 --> 11:23.870
<b>Good work.</b>

11:24.370 --> 11:26.870
<b>And I've dug an emergency escape tunnel.</b>

11:26.870 --> 11:29.710
<b>Oh, that was fast. Well done, Susanoo.</b>

11:32.500 --> 11:34.590
<b>Don't think you've won just yet.</b>

11:35.290 --> 11:37.050
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

11:39.970 --> 11:41.720
<b>I know we just moved in,</b>

11:41.720 --> 11:44.760
<b>but we've been tasked with eliminating the new Danger Beasts.</b>

11:45.510 --> 11:50.640
<b>They generally act in packs and 
seem to possess some intelligence.</b>

11:51.190 --> 11:53.600
<b>They're quite strong physically,</b>

11:53.600 --> 11:57.690
<b>and all of the martial arts masters 
seeking to test their skill have lost.</b>

11:57.690 --> 12:04.160
<b>They've also attacked people and livestock in the forests and mines to the south.</b>

12:05.070 --> 12:09.160
<b>I'm told the Jaegers and the imperial army 
have been culling them daily,</b>

12:09.160 --> 12:12.790
<b>but their numbers don't appear to be dropping 
and casualties are mounting.</b>

12:12.790 --> 12:15.460
<b>If even the empire is having this much trouble,</b>

12:15.460 --> 12:16.880
<b>it's probably not a trap.</b>

12:19.050 --> 12:23.300
<b>Simply put, we and the empire will end up 
working toward the same goal.</b>

12:23.300 --> 12:24.130
<b>Got it?</b>

12:24.720 --> 12:26.140
<b>Of course!</b>

12:26.140 --> 12:28.260
<b>That's just how things turned out this time.</b>

12:28.260 --> 12:31.640
<b>Considering what we just heard, 
we should deal with them as quickly as possible.</b>

12:33.890 --> 12:37.150
<b>But I'd like to avoid bumping
heads with the soldiers.</b>

12:38.820 --> 12:40.940
<b>We are Night Raid.</b>

12:40.940 --> 12:43.820
<b>We can simply move at night 
while the empire's forces rest.</b>

12:43.820 --> 12:45.280
<b>Oh, right.</b>

12:47.030 --> 12:50.450
<b>Putting ourselves in danger
to exterminate some monsters...</b>

12:51.040 --> 12:54.160
<b>We should just leave this to the Jaegers.</b>

12:54.160 --> 12:56.790
<b>I knew it. You guys really are soft.</b>

12:58.920 --> 13:01.050
<b>I understand what you're saying.</b>

13:01.590 --> 13:05.550
<b>But even now, those things 
might be killing more people.</b>

13:05.970 --> 13:10.010
<b>Though we may be assassins, 
I believe we're on the people's side!</b>

13:10.010 --> 13:13.520
<b>I want to wipe them out as soon as possible 
so we can save even more lives!</b>

13:14.270 --> 13:17.060
<b>I thought you might say that.</b>

13:17.060 --> 13:18.560
<b>Very well.</b>

13:22.280 --> 13:23.610
<b>Tatsumi...</b>

13:23.610 --> 13:26.410
<b>There is something of vital importance I must tell you.</b>

13:26.860 --> 13:28.450
<b>Su...</b>

13:28.870 --> 13:32.450
<b>Your fly is open!
It's bothering me, so please close it.</b>

13:38.040 --> 13:40.290
<b>Wow, you almost sounded
cool there for a moment!</b>

13:40.290 --> 13:42.090
<b>Hey, how do you feel right now?</b>

13:42.090 --> 13:43.210
<b>Well?</b>

13:43.210 --> 13:44.800
<b>That's what you get for posturing.</b>

13:44.800 --> 13:46.220
<b>Shut up!</b>

13:46.220 --> 13:47.800
<b>I'm sorry, Tatsumi.</b>

13:49.800 --> 13:52.600
<b>I noticed it, but I thought it was some sort of fashion statement.</b>

13:52.600 --> 13:55.680
<b>What kind of free spirit do you take me for?</b>

13:57.560 --> 13:59.940
<b>I'll make sure I check regularly from now on.</b>

13:59.940 --> 14:02.320
<b>No, please don't!</b>

14:02.730 --> 14:06.070
<b>"Though our flies may be down, 
I believe we're on the people's side."</b>

14:06.070 --> 14:07.450
<b>I'm gonna take <i>you</i> down, Lubb!</b>

14:07.450 --> 14:08.780
<b>Don't worry about it.</b>

14:08.780 --> 14:11.620
<b>Your fly was open for the people's sake, right?</b>

14:11.620 --> 14:12.830
<b>Not you too!</b>

14:13.370 --> 14:15.450
<b>This is how we are.</b>

14:16.000 --> 14:18.290
<b>I apologize for any trouble
we cause you, Chelsea.</b>

14:18.290 --> 14:21.460
<b>That's fine, but it still worries me.</b>

14:21.460 --> 14:24.880
<b>From what I saw in Sheele and Bulat's records,</b>

14:25.460 --> 14:29.890
<b>I wouldn't be surprised if this softness took Tatsumi's life one day.</b>

14:36.310 --> 14:39.140
<b>Run, I should tell you.</b>

14:39.140 --> 14:43.150
<b>According to the prime minister's findings, 
those Danger Beasts were once human.</b>

14:43.440 --> 14:44.610
<b>As I suspected.</b>

14:45.480 --> 14:48.700
<b>I thought their physical 
appearance was quite similar.</b>

14:48.700 --> 14:50.780
<b>Turning humans into Danger Beasts...</b>

14:51.370 --> 14:54.240
<b>No one could do that but a Relic-wielder.</b>

14:54.830 --> 14:59.210
<b>Those Danger Beasts may have been the Doctor's experiments.</b>

15:00.170 --> 15:04.880
<b>They started to show up 
right after he disappeared.</b>

15:05.340 --> 15:06.510
<b>Have you any other proof?</b>

15:07.050 --> 15:12.090
<b>We didn't see much of note
when examining his lab.</b>

15:12.090 --> 15:14.470
<b>He should have been doing
all sorts of experiments,</b>

15:14.470 --> 15:16.770
<b>but we couldn't find any trace of that.</b>

15:17.350 --> 15:20.890
<b>So he might have had another, secret lab?</b>

15:21.350 --> 15:26.230
<b>Yes. Perhaps the specimens he 
held there escaped into the wild.</b>

15:26.820 --> 15:31.160
<b>It could be an entirely unrelated Relic-wielder, of course,</b>

15:31.160 --> 15:33.620
<b>but that seems like 
too much of a coincidence.</b>

15:34.240 --> 15:39.750
<b>We thought the Doctor was attacked by rebels while looking for Tatsumi, but maybe we were wrong.</b>

15:39.750 --> 15:46.550
<b>Perhaps he found their hideout and tried to turn them all into test subjects, only to be killed instead.</b>

15:47.840 --> 15:51.590
<b>It seems that man may have been
much further gone than we thought.</b>

15:52.760 --> 15:56.050
<b>If those Danger Beasts are a product of the Doctor's experimentation,</b>

15:56.050 --> 15:57.930
<b>their numbers should be limited.</b>

15:58.350 --> 16:00.680
<b>So the problem should resolve itself eventually.</b>

16:01.640 --> 16:04.560
<b>We still have one more problem to address.</b>

16:04.900 --> 16:08.610
<b>Did those things escape on their own?</b>

16:09.070 --> 16:11.530
<b>Or did someone release them?</b>

16:13.820 --> 16:15.240
<b>I understand.</b>

16:15.240 --> 16:18.490
<b>I'll carry out further investigation into this matter.</b>

16:18.910 --> 16:20.040
<b>I'm counting on you.</b>

16:20.580 --> 16:22.920
<b>This issue could run deeper than we thought.</b>

16:23.920 --> 16:28.460
<b>I must say, it's rather rare 
to see you admiring flowers.</b>

16:29.840 --> 16:31.170
<b>Right...</b>

16:31.920 --> 16:36.510
<b>If you rub these flowers into a wound, 
they cause intense pain.</b>

16:36.970 --> 16:39.520
<b>They're excellent for light torture.</b>

16:42.770 --> 16:44.810
<b>I shall keep that in mind.</b>

16:46.100 --> 16:48.730
<b>You evildoers who threaten the capital's residents!</b>

16:48.730 --> 16:50.070
<b>Coro, number one!</b>

16:52.690 --> 16:54.990
<b>Shinko's Ball of Justice!</b>

16:57.280 --> 16:59.790
<b>Coro, devour the evildoers while they're weak!</b>

17:05.500 --> 17:08.500
<b><i>So those are the Jaegers I've heard about.</i></b>

17:09.040 --> 17:11.880
<b><i>I see. They're rather strong.</i></b>

17:09.040 --> 17:11.880
<b>There, there. Did that fill your tummy?</b>

17:13.470 --> 17:17.550
<b><i>I'll have you play with my toys a while longer.</i></b>

17:21.680 --> 17:24.230
<b>I can't believe I got paired with a guy.</b>

17:24.230 --> 17:26.810
<b>You don't have to sound so depressed about it.</b>

17:26.810 --> 17:30.320
<b>There aren't any imperial soldiers hiding out here, are there?</b>

17:30.320 --> 17:31.940
<b>You don't have to act so scared either.</b>

17:33.030 --> 17:34.070
<b>You know...</b>

17:34.070 --> 17:38.240
<b>Cowardice is a vital survival skill for an assassin.</b>

17:38.240 --> 17:41.870
<b>Najenda said so too. Don't you forget it.</b>

17:44.620 --> 17:47.460
<b>By the way, I was thinking about this earlier, but...</b>

17:48.830 --> 17:49.920
<b>What?</b>

17:49.920 --> 17:54.130
<b>You call the boss by her name, "Najenda."</b>

17:56.840 --> 17:59.640
<b>Well... Well, you know...</b>

18:00.510 --> 18:05.020
<b>We've known each other since she was in the Imperial Army.</b>

18:07.940 --> 18:11.730
<b>I was the fourth son of a wealthy merchant living on the outskirts of the empire.</b>

18:12.320 --> 18:17.200
<b>Ever since I was a kid, I had whatever I wanted 
and could do whatever I pleased.</b>

18:17.200 --> 18:19.570
<b>So I grew somewhat bored with the world.</b>

18:19.950 --> 18:21.910
<b>Man, you're an ass.</b>

18:21.910 --> 18:24.160
<b>I'm getting to the sad part! Listen up!</b>

18:25.580 --> 18:30.170
<b>Anyway, that was when Najenda
was assigned to the city where I lived.</b>

18:31.040 --> 18:33.250
<b>It was love at first sight.</b>

18:34.420 --> 18:37.220
<b>So I enlisted as a soldier</b>

18:37.220 --> 18:42.050
<b>and used my own skills and abilities to work my way up the ranks.</b>

18:44.140 --> 18:47.680
<b>Then the reason that you're in Night Raid...</b>

18:47.680 --> 18:51.230
<b>You could say it's out of my love for her.</b>

18:52.520 --> 18:54.190
<b>When I left the capital,</b>

18:54.190 --> 18:56.650
<b>I made sure the records said I was dead.</b>

18:57.780 --> 19:00.450
<b>Chivalrous, don't you think?</b>

19:00.860 --> 19:03.120
<b>And I'll never be rewarded.</b>

19:03.120 --> 19:06.330
<b>Pretty sad, huh? Doesn't it just make you cry?</b>

19:07.790 --> 19:09.250
<b>Lubb...</b>

19:09.960 --> 19:13.000
<b>If that's the case, quit trying to peep on other women in the bath!</b>

19:13.000 --> 19:13.670
<b>Huh?</b>

19:13.670 --> 19:17.010
<b>Having someone you love is a separate issue from wanting to look at cute girls!</b>

19:17.010 --> 19:18.300
<b>The hell are you talking about?</b>

19:18.300 --> 19:20.880
<b>That's <i>why</i> you'll never be rewarded!</b>

19:21.430 --> 19:23.970
<b>Just wait. One day, I'll make her fall for me.</b>

19:23.970 --> 19:26.850
<b>If that ever happens, 
I'll treat you to anything you want.</b>

19:28.100 --> 19:31.060
<b>It doesn't look like any 
Danger Beasts are around here.</b>

19:31.060 --> 19:33.650
<b>Maybe the ones in the mountains have all been hunted already.</b>

19:33.650 --> 19:37.070
<b>I've got my wires laid out, 
but nothing's been caught on them yet.</b>

19:37.570 --> 19:38.280
<b>All right.</b>

19:38.780 --> 19:42.910
<b>If this area's clear, I'm gonna go take a look at the summit.</b>

19:42.910 --> 19:46.030
<b>If you spot something, run. 
We'll fight together.</b>

19:46.450 --> 19:47.330
<b>Got it!</b>

19:56.800 --> 20:00.720
<b><i>I don't see any of the creatures
we're looking for. Or anything living.</i></b>

20:07.220 --> 20:09.140
<b>I wonder if they're sleeping.</b>

20:15.020 --> 20:18.360
<b>I'm supposed to be on night patrol,</b>

20:18.360 --> 20:21.030
<b>but here I am, admiring the moon.</b>

20:21.030 --> 20:23.910
<b>This isn't like me at all.</b>

20:25.530 --> 20:28.240
<b><i>And my strange behavior...</i></b>

20:28.910 --> 20:31.250
<b><i>is all your fault, Tatsumi.</i></b>

20:33.830 --> 20:34.750
<b><i>A person's shadow?</i></b>

20:34.750 --> 20:36.330
<b><i>Or is it a Danger Beast?</i></b>

20:37.960 --> 20:40.340
<b><i>Whoever it is, they're rather unlucky.</i></b>

20:40.340 --> 20:44.050
<b><i>I happen to be in a rather gloomy mood.</i></b>

20:46.010 --> 20:47.220
<b>Wh-What?</b>

20:50.470 --> 20:52.310
<b>I'll be your opponent.</b>

20:52.310 --> 20:54.190
<b>Time to test out my new torture method—</b>

20:54.190 --> 20:55.690
<b>Huh?</b>

20:56.520 --> 20:58.190
<b>Tatsumi?</b>

20:59.520 --> 21:01.690
<b><i>Wh-Why is Esdeath here?</i></b>

21:01.690 --> 21:02.570
<b><i>Simple coincidence?</i></b>

21:02.570 --> 21:05.910
<b><i>It's not like I could have predicted 
that she'd suddenly fall from the sky!</i></b>

21:06.490 --> 21:09.740
<b><i>What should I do? What should I do?</i></b>

21:14.120 --> 21:16.460
<b>Now <i>they show up?!</i></b>

21:16.460 --> 21:19.040
<b><i>Wait a sec. These ones look really strong.</i></b>

21:19.040 --> 21:20.800
<b><i>I could use them as a distraction and escape.</i></b>

21:25.800 --> 21:28.930
<b>Well, there goes my opportunity to get out of here.</b>

21:36.020 --> 21:38.060
<b>Don't get in my way.</b>

21:40.570 --> 21:41.980
<b>So this isn't a dream.</b>

21:42.360 --> 21:46.150
<b>I've been longing for the day
when we'd be reunited, Tatsumi.</b>

21:46.150 --> 21:50.830
<b><i>I sure wish it </i>was<i> a dream.</i></b>

21:50.830 --> 21:54.000
<b><i>And why won't she just
put that thing out of its misery?</i></b>

21:54.960 --> 21:55.000
{ED first frame}

22:05.990 --> 22:11.700
utsuro na me wo shite

22:05.990 --> 22:11.700
Your eyes look empty

22:11.700 --> 22:15.130
nani wo tsutaetai no

22:11.700 --> 22:15.130
What is it you want to say

22:17.220 --> 22:26.290
ukande wa kiete iku anata no zanzou

22:17.220 --> 22:26.290
Your after-image  floats away and disappears into nothingness

22:28.080 --> 22:33.180
hikitomenaide sono yasashisatte douse

22:28.080 --> 22:33.180
Please don't hold me back

22:33.180 --> 22:37.640
musekinin yo shitteru

22:33.180 --> 22:37.640
I know your kindness lacks any responsibility

22:38.650 --> 22:43.970
tsuyoku nakya atashi wa ikiru imi mo nai

22:38.650 --> 22:43.970
If I can't be stronger, I have no reason to live

22:43.970 --> 22:48.700
isso kowashite yo

22:43.970 --> 22:48.700
So just break me already

22:50.620 --> 22:55.930
itoshisa de kokoro wa moroku nari

22:50.620 --> 22:55.930
Love makes my heart grow brittle

22:55.930 --> 23:01.400
nigiritsubuseru hodo yasashikutte

22:55.930 --> 23:01.400
So gentle it threatens to crush it

23:01.400 --> 23:11.710
dare ni mo mise ta koto nai yowa sa ga hitotsu dake kobore ta

23:01.400 --> 23:11.710
Of the weaknesses I've never shown anyone, one has come tumbling out

23:13.020 --> 23:17.900
donna itami mo gaman dekita no yo

23:13.020 --> 23:17.900
I've persevered through every sort of pain

23:17.900 --> 23:23.870
shiritaku nanka nakatta

23:17.900 --> 23:23.870
And I wish I'd never known any of it

23:33.430 --> 23:39.980
Kill   the   Giant   Danger   Beasts

23:33.430 --> 23:39.980
Kill   the   Giant   Danger   Beasts

23:33.430 --> 23:39.980
Kill   the   Giant   Danger   Beasts
