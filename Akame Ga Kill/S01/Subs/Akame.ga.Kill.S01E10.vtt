Kill   the   Temptation

04:03.220 --> 04:06.720
Kill   the   Temptation

04:05.140 --> 04:06.470
<b>Incredible.</b>

04:06.970 --> 04:08.140
<b>Tatsumi.</b>

04:08.770 --> 04:10.730
<b>I shall train you myself.</b>

04:10.730 --> 04:13.100
<b>One day, you too will be able to fight like that.</b>

04:13.940 --> 04:16.190
<b>You're surprisingly kind.</b>

04:16.190 --> 04:17.820
<b>Were you expecting me to be different?</b>

04:18.570 --> 04:21.990
<b>To be honest, this is my first time experiencing these feelings.</b>

04:21.990 --> 04:24.530
<b>My first taste of love.</b>

04:25.070 --> 04:27.370
<b>But it's not at all bad.</b>

04:29.080 --> 04:34.540
<b><i>Is it possible that I could convince her to join us?{looooooooooooooooool}</i></b>

04:34.540 --> 04:37.840
<b><i>True, she's done things for which she can never be forgiven.</i></b>

04:37.840 --> 04:42.300
<b><i>But she could devote herself to 
overthrowing the empire as penance.</i></b>

04:42.300 --> 04:44.050
<b><i>A-All right.</i></b>

04:44.050 --> 04:45.800
<b><i>I'll try to persuade her tonight!{tatsumi so dumb}</i></b>

04:46.260 --> 04:48.510
<b><i>It's time I stepped up as a man!</i></b>

05:02.150 --> 05:05.530
<b><i>How did I end up in this situation?</i></b>

05:11.370 --> 05:12.370
<b><i>Pull yourself together!</i></b>

05:12.750 --> 05:14.500
<b><i>I can't get cold feet now.</i></b>

05:14.500 --> 05:17.210
<b><i>I have to convince her to join us.</i></b>

05:17.210 --> 05:18.330
<b><i>Just do it!</i></b>

05:18.330 --> 05:20.170
<b><i>I'm a ferocious man!</i></b>

05:20.840 --> 05:22.880
<b><i>I won't let her take the lead!</i></b>

05:27.930 --> 05:29.600
<b>Sorry to make you wait.</b>

05:29.600 --> 05:31.350
<b>N-Not at all!</b>

05:31.350 --> 05:32.470
<b>Would you like a drink?</b>

05:32.470 --> 05:33.430
<b>Uh, no!</b>

05:33.430 --> 05:34.890
<b>I'm fine, yeah.</b>

05:34.890 --> 05:37.440
<b>Hmm? Are you nervous?</b>

05:37.440 --> 05:38.400
<b>No!</b>

05:39.610 --> 05:41.150
<b>You really are a cute one.</b>

05:41.770 --> 05:45.490
<b>Well, I'm not quite sure where to go from here either.</b>

05:45.490 --> 05:48.660
<b>But I'm sure we can figure it out between us.</b>

05:49.700 --> 05:52.580
<b>Uh, um... I'd like to ask you something.</b>

05:52.910 --> 05:53.870
<b>Well...</b>

05:53.870 --> 05:58.080
<b>Esdeath, you like me, don't you?</b>

06:03.050 --> 06:05.550
<b>If I didn't like you, I wouldn't be doing this.</b>

06:06.590 --> 06:09.550
<b>Th-Then there's something I want to ask you.</b>

06:09.550 --> 06:11.720
<b>Oh? What is it? Tell me.</b>

06:12.430 --> 06:14.390
<b>Tell me loud and clear.</b>

06:16.390 --> 06:19.310
<b>I hate the empire as it is now.</b>

06:19.310 --> 06:22.230
<b>I would expect that many people feel that way.</b>

06:22.230 --> 06:22.900
<b>What of it?</b>

06:23.270 --> 06:25.110
<b>If I'm to fight, I don't want to fight for it.</b>

06:25.110 --> 06:27.950
<b>In fact, I've considered joining the Revolutionary Army.</b>

06:27.950 --> 06:30.570
<b>Will you fight for them alongside me?</b>

06:30.990 --> 06:33.830
<b>Together, we could greatly reduce the necessary bloodshed.</b>

06:34.450 --> 06:35.370
<b>Tatsumi...</b>

06:40.000 --> 06:43.340
<b>How could you say that to an imperial general?</b>

06:44.300 --> 06:46.960
<b>I know it's an unreasonable thing for me to ask.</b>

06:46.960 --> 06:50.050
<b>But I don't want us to end up as enemies one day.</b>

06:52.390 --> 06:55.100
<b>You don't need to worry about that.</b>

06:55.100 --> 06:57.680
<b>All you have to do is stay here with me.</b>

06:58.390 --> 07:01.350
<b>I understand that you've had a hard life.</b>

07:01.350 --> 07:03.980
<b>But from now on, I won't let anything harm you.</b>

07:05.020 --> 07:08.150
<b>And I won't seek out any other lovers.</b>

07:08.150 --> 07:10.530
<b>You're the only man for me.</b>

07:10.530 --> 07:12.320
<b>I won't ever let you feel lonely.</b>

07:14.240 --> 07:16.950
<b>I'm really happy you feel that way about me,</b>

07:16.950 --> 07:18.290
<b>but that's not enough.</b>

07:18.700 --> 07:21.420
<b>This isn't just about my happiness.</b>

07:21.420 --> 07:23.080
<b>Are you concerned for your family?</b>

07:23.080 --> 07:25.210
<b>I'll have them placed under my protection.</b>

07:25.210 --> 07:26.750
<b>It isn't that.</b>

07:26.750 --> 07:31.220
<b>I want a nation where everyone can live their lives as they see fit.</b>

07:31.220 --> 07:35.640
<b>And that can never happen with this corrupt capital at the core.</b>

07:35.640 --> 07:36.760
<b>Tatsumi...</b>

07:36.760 --> 07:38.140
<b>S-Surely you understand.</b>

07:38.140 --> 07:40.770
<b>I do not. The feelings of the weak are beyond me.</b>

07:42.440 --> 07:45.020
<b>This world is ruled by one law: survival of the fittest.</b>

07:45.020 --> 07:46.570
<b>The weak face natural selection.</b>

07:47.150 --> 07:49.740
<b>Their deaths are to be expected.</b>

07:49.990 --> 07:53.660
<b>Th-There's no way I could possibly love 
anyone who thinks that way!</b>

07:53.660 --> 07:55.120
<b>If you truly have feelings for me,</b>

07:55.120 --> 07:57.280
<b>I beg you to change your principles!</b>

07:58.200 --> 08:00.910
<b><i>He's cute when he's angry, too.</i></b>

08:02.160 --> 08:02.960
<b>I'm afraid...</b>

08:03.870 --> 08:04.960
<b>that won't happen.</b>

08:05.880 --> 08:07.420
<b>Don't misunderstand our relationship.</b>

08:07.420 --> 08:09.420
<b>I will not be changed by you.</b>

08:09.420 --> 08:11.630
<b>You're the one who will take after me!</b>

08:11.630 --> 08:12.840
<b>That is the only outcome!</b>

08:12.840 --> 08:16.350
<b>Don't expect me to change 
just because you want me to, either!</b>

08:16.350 --> 08:17.810
<b>Not even if you torture me.</b>

08:18.720 --> 08:19.680
<b>Stubborn, aren't we?</b>

08:20.310 --> 08:22.140
<b><i>But perhaps that's exactly why</i></b>

08:22.940 --> 08:25.150
<b><i>he can smile like that.</i></b>

08:25.600 --> 08:27.520
<b><i>I want to see that smile again.</i></b>

08:27.520 --> 08:28.730
<b><i>I want his heart.</i></b>

08:28.730 --> 08:31.110
<b><i>I want to make him mine.</i></b>

08:31.110 --> 08:32.450
<b><i>In that case...</i></b>

08:32.450 --> 08:35.410
<b>Well, I'm sure today's mission left you exhausted.</b>

08:35.410 --> 08:37.490
<b>We'll discuss this again later.</b>

08:37.490 --> 08:39.200
<b>For now, let's rest.</b>

08:39.200 --> 08:39.990
<b>Huh?</b>

08:40.330 --> 08:42.580
<b>Then I'll take that sofa over there and—</b>

08:42.580 --> 08:46.170
<b>I won't do anything tonight, so at least share my bed.</b>

08:46.170 --> 08:47.540
<b>O-Oh, yeah!</b>

08:47.540 --> 08:49.050
<b>I gotta take a shower!</b>

08:49.050 --> 08:50.170
<b>This goes without saying,</b>

08:50.170 --> 08:54.630
<b>but if you cause a scene within these walls or try to escape, it will mean your death.</b>

08:54.630 --> 08:56.840
<b>So don't try anything silly.</b>

08:57.300 --> 08:59.140
<b>I understand.</b>

08:59.140 --> 09:03.430
<b><i>Everyone in Night Raid warned me that the palace was extremely dangerous.</i></b>

09:06.400 --> 09:09.650
<b>Oh, we could have showered together.</b>

09:10.190 --> 09:12.900
<b><i>Well, you can't hurry love.{it'll just have to wait}</i></b>

09:13.940 --> 09:16.950
<b>That said, Tatsumi will not only serve as backup for the Jaegers,</b>

09:16.950 --> 09:19.910
<b>but as my lover as well.</b>

09:20.410 --> 09:23.750
<b>Do any of you have a spouse or significant other?</b>

09:25.040 --> 09:26.330
<b>Huh?!</b>

09:26.330 --> 09:27.920
<b>Is that true, Mr. Bols?</b>

09:28.420 --> 09:31.000
<b>Yep. I've been married for six years.</b>

09:31.000 --> 09:34.470
<b>She's so perfect that I can't believe she's with me!</b>

09:34.470 --> 09:36.550
<b>Then I must ask, Bols...</b>

09:36.550 --> 09:39.550
<b>What should I do in order to capture Tatsumi's heart?{suck his cock, what else}</b>

09:39.550 --> 09:42.560
<b>The secret to capturing the heart of your beloved...</b>

09:42.560 --> 09:44.770
<b>is persistence!</b>

09:44.770 --> 09:47.390
<b>I was rejected twice myself,</b>

09:47.390 --> 09:50.520
<b>but I got another chance, 
and that's when she finally became mine!</b>

09:50.520 --> 09:53.530
<b>Bear in mind that it does take some time.</b>

09:53.530 --> 09:55.820
<b>Hmm... I see.</b>

09:57.990 --> 09:59.990
<b><i>That's right. Remember what Bols said.</i></b>

10:00.780 --> 10:03.830
<b><i>You'll fall for me one day, Tatsumi.</i></b>

10:03.830 --> 10:06.290
<b><i>I've never had a challenge like this before.</i></b>

10:11.590 --> 10:12.460
<b>Hey!</b>

10:12.460 --> 10:14.050
<b>How'd you sleep last night—</b>

10:14.050 --> 10:16.130
<b>Not well, huh?</b>

10:16.130 --> 10:18.930
<b>I was so nervous I couldn't get a wink.</b>

10:19.510 --> 10:21.180
<b><i>She said she wouldn't do anything,</i></b>

10:21.180 --> 10:23.430
<b><i>but I woke up to find her 
hugging me like a body pillow.</i></b>

10:23.430 --> 10:26.390
<b>Isn't it a bit early for snacks, Kurome?</b>

10:26.390 --> 10:27.980
<b>Mind your own business.</b>

10:27.980 --> 10:30.600
<b>You should eat more seafood. It's good for you.</b>

10:30.600 --> 10:32.820
<b>I'd rather not reek of fish like you.</b>

10:32.820 --> 10:34.610
<b>Huh? What?</b>

10:34.610 --> 10:35.530
<b>Do I smell?</b>

10:35.530 --> 10:37.700
<b>Uh, not really... I think.</b>

10:39.950 --> 10:41.240
<b><i>What is this?</i></b>

10:41.240 --> 10:42.530
<b><i>Her looks...</i></b>

10:42.950 --> 10:44.910
<b><i>And even her name, "Kurome"...</i></b>

10:44.910 --> 10:46.910
<b><i>They're giving me some serious déjà vu.</i></b>

10:48.660 --> 10:50.580
<b>You can't have any.</b>

10:50.580 --> 10:52.290
<b><i>A-And her appetite!</i></b>

10:52.290 --> 10:53.920
<b><i>There's no mistake. She's just like Akame!</i></b>

10:53.920 --> 10:55.380
<b><i>They must have some relation!</i></b>

10:55.380 --> 10:56.260
<b>What?</b>

10:56.260 --> 10:58.880
<b>Uh, no offense intended,</b>

10:58.880 --> 11:01.760
<b>but you look a lot like that girl, 
Akame, from the wanted posters.</b>

11:01.760 --> 11:03.760
<b>Oh, I was thinking the same thing.</b>

11:03.760 --> 11:06.640
<b>We're related. She used to be an honored member of society...</b>

11:07.350 --> 11:09.480
<b>until she betrayed the empire.</b>

11:10.100 --> 11:12.980
<b>I really want to see her again...</b>

11:12.980 --> 11:17.150
<b>so I can kill her with my own two hands.</b>

11:17.150 --> 11:19.110
<b>After all, she's my dear older sister.</b>

11:23.280 --> 11:25.240
<b>Tatsumi, we're heading to Mount Fake.</b>

11:25.240 --> 11:27.620
<b>We'll spend the next few days hunting.</b>

11:27.620 --> 11:28.700
<b>What's Mount Fake?</b>

11:28.700 --> 11:32.670
<b>Mount Fake is Fake Mountain, of course.</b>

11:33.000 --> 11:35.630
<b><i>We're going to the outskirts. 
This is my chance to escape!</i></b>

11:35.630 --> 11:37.800
<b>Wave and Kurome, you'll be joining us.</b>

11:37.800 --> 11:40.170
<b>We'll hunt Danger Beasts while keeping an eye out for enemies.</b>

11:40.170 --> 11:40.880
<b>Roger.</b>

11:40.880 --> 11:43.680
<b>Kurome and I will take the east side until dusk.</b>

11:43.680 --> 11:46.100
<b>Wave and Tatsumi will scout the west side.</b>

11:46.100 --> 11:47.850
<b>Come nightfall, we'll switch,</b>

11:47.850 --> 11:49.600
<b>and Tatsumi will be with me.</b>

11:50.230 --> 11:53.480
<b><i>Higher-level Danger Beasts appear at night.</i></b>

11:53.480 --> 11:55.360
<b><i>This is my chance to impress him.</i></b>

12:03.660 --> 12:06.740
<b>I couldn't say this back at the palace,</b>

12:06.740 --> 12:08.450
<b>but you sure have it rough.</b>

12:08.450 --> 12:10.200
<b>If you ever need to talk, I'll listen.</b>

12:12.160 --> 12:12.960
<b>Thanks.</b>

12:13.420 --> 12:14.630
<b>But I should be okay.</b>

12:14.630 --> 12:17.040
<b>I'm used to this kind of treatment.</b>

12:17.040 --> 12:19.260
<b>I kinda know what you mean.</b>

12:19.260 --> 12:22.300
<b>In fact, I feel like we're pretty similar.</b>

12:22.300 --> 12:23.220
<b>Similar?</b>

12:23.220 --> 12:24.640
<b>How so?</b>

12:24.640 --> 12:25.260
<b>Huh?</b>

12:25.260 --> 12:28.140
<b>Well, uh... How should I put this?</b>

12:28.140 --> 12:30.600
<b>I feel like we've dealt with the same kinds of problems.</b>

12:30.600 --> 12:32.810
<b>Or that we will in the future.</b>

12:32.810 --> 12:35.150
<b>Uh, yeah, I understand.</b>

12:35.150 --> 12:37.360
<b>I know just what you mean. Say no more.</b>

12:37.820 --> 12:41.360
<b>Anyway, since we're so similar, 
I'm sure we'll get along—</b>

12:42.860 --> 12:43.820
<b>Tatsumi?</b>

12:45.240 --> 12:45.820
<b>Huh?</b>

12:48.280 --> 12:49.450
<b>Watch out!{i swear this is a doom sound effect}</b>

12:52.410 --> 12:54.750
<b>Thanks! I owe you one!</b>

12:54.750 --> 12:55.540
<b>Don't mention it!</b>

12:55.540 --> 12:56.630
<b><i>Huh?</i></b>

12:56.630 --> 12:59.550
<b><i>I stepped in to defend him without thinking,</i></b>

12:59.550 --> 13:01.630
<b><i>but this is actually the perfect chance to escape.</i></b>

13:03.090 --> 13:05.090
<b>It never rains but it pours, huh?</b>

13:05.090 --> 13:07.390
<b>Too bad you guys aren't edible like sea beasts.</b>

13:08.050 --> 13:10.390
<b>We'll take care of this in no time!</b>

13:14.480 --> 13:16.980
<b>Oh, was that it?</b>

13:16.980 --> 13:18.860
<b>Looks like you're done over there too.</b>

13:18.860 --> 13:20.820
<b>Tatsu... mi?</b>

13:21.360 --> 13:22.400
<b>Eh?</b>

13:22.400 --> 13:23.320
<b>Ehh?{Meh. :c}</b>

13:27.030 --> 13:30.780
<b><i>Most people wouldn't be able to give a Relic-wielder the slip.</i></b>

13:30.780 --> 13:31.540
<b><i>However...</i></b>

13:31.870 --> 13:35.000
<b><i>Since I have a Relic of my own, it's a different story.</i></b>

13:35.660 --> 13:37.210
<b>Tatsumi!</b>

13:37.210 --> 13:38.250
<b>Where'd you go?</b>

13:39.340 --> 13:40.500
<b><i>Don't tell me he ran away!</i></b>

13:43.800 --> 13:44.840
<b>This is bad!</b>

13:44.840 --> 13:47.380
<b>I get how you feel, but I can't let you do that!</b>

13:47.380 --> 13:49.350
<b>I don't wanna die either, you know?</b>

13:50.930 --> 13:52.310
<b>Guess I have no choice.</b>

13:54.140 --> 13:57.310
<b>Grand Chariot!{cool cg bro}{is this fucking jojo now}</b>

14:02.820 --> 14:04.940
<b><i>This should be enough.</i></b>

14:05.360 --> 14:07.320
<b><i>There's no way he could come this far.</i></b>

14:10.370 --> 14:11.410
<b><i>Wh-What?</i></b>

14:12.370 --> 14:15.040
<b><i>An armor-type Relic like mine?</i></b>

14:15.040 --> 14:15.870
<b>Hey, you.</b>

14:16.330 --> 14:18.580
<b>Looks like I've stumbled upon a big catch.</b>

14:18.960 --> 14:21.040
<b>I know that Relic. It's Incursio.</b>

14:21.630 --> 14:24.000
<b>The prototype for my Grand Chariot.</b>

14:24.000 --> 14:24.960
<b>And more importantly...{aaaaa}</b>

14:25.510 --> 14:29.430
<b>I know its wearer belongs to Night Raid!</b>

14:31.350 --> 14:32.850
<b><i>Change of plans.</i></b>

14:32.850 --> 14:36.480
<b><i>Eliminating Night Raid takes 
precedence over finding Tatsumi.</i></b>

14:40.150 --> 14:41.400
<b><i>He looks tough.</i></b>

14:41.400 --> 14:45.400
<b><i>They said my Relic is an improved version of Incursio,</i></b>

14:45.400 --> 14:46.570
<b><i>but I mustn't take this lightly.</i></b>

14:46.570 --> 14:49.110
<b><i>This guy... Is it Wave?</i></b>

14:49.110 --> 14:51.120
<b><i>Or is someone else after me?</i></b>

14:51.490 --> 14:52.570
<b><i>Regardless...</i></b>

14:52.990 --> 14:53.490
<b>Huh?</b>

14:53.490 --> 14:55.790
<b><i>I can't allow Esdeath to find me like this!</i></b>

14:55.790 --> 14:57.290
<b><i>I gotta get out of here fast.</i></b>

14:59.120 --> 15:00.500
<b>I won't let you escape.</b>

15:00.500 --> 15:02.580
<b>Accept your fate, and face me!</b>

15:04.250 --> 15:05.340
<b>Stop!</b>

15:05.340 --> 15:07.050
<b>I have no reason to fight you!</b>

15:07.050 --> 15:08.470
<b>You may not...</b>

15:09.760 --> 15:13.220
<b>But I have plenty, Night Raid!</b>

15:16.180 --> 15:18.230
<b>I've read up on you.</b>

15:18.230 --> 15:19.940
<b>You indiscriminately kill from the shadows.</b>

15:20.560 --> 15:23.560
<b>Evildoers like you directly threaten the capital's safety and peace.</b>

15:23.560 --> 15:26.400
<b>On top of that, I hear you're 
conspiring with the rebel army.</b>

15:26.820 --> 15:29.820
<b>I can't allow you to remain in this world!</b>

15:31.950 --> 15:33.450
<b>You're wrong.</b>

15:33.450 --> 15:36.030
<b>It's true that we commit murder.</b>

15:36.030 --> 15:38.040
<b>However, I—</b>

15:38.500 --> 15:39.750
<b>no, we—</b>

15:40.500 --> 15:42.540
<b>are not evil!</b>

15:43.290 --> 15:43.920
<b><i>Here he comes.</i></b>

15:44.330 --> 15:46.920
<b><i>Being pumped won't keep you alive!</i></b>

15:51.180 --> 15:52.760
<b><i>That's right.</i></b>

15:52.760 --> 15:55.010
<b><i>I have to get out of here, no matter what,</i></b>

15:55.010 --> 15:56.260
<b><i>and return with my information.</i></b>

15:57.180 --> 16:00.350
<b>This won't be much of a battle if you don't fight back!</b>

16:00.350 --> 16:01.060
<b><i>This is bad!</i></b>

16:01.060 --> 16:03.150
<b>Grand Fall!</b>

16:05.810 --> 16:07.360
<b><i>A direct hit.</i></b>

16:07.360 --> 16:09.150
<b><i>It's too bad that I kicked him into the river.</i></b>

16:09.150 --> 16:10.570
<b><i>But I won't lose sight of—</i></b>

16:12.150 --> 16:13.530
<b><i>He isn't there?</i></b>

16:13.530 --> 16:14.620
<b><i>Where'd he go?</i></b>

16:15.450 --> 16:17.700
<b><i>He rode the current and swam away?</i></b>

16:17.700 --> 16:20.660
<b><i>That won't work against a man of the sea!</i></b>

16:28.380 --> 16:30.630
<b><i>I got away without having to fight.</i></b>

16:30.630 --> 16:33.880
<b><i>Looks like he doesn't have the same invisibility power I do.</i></b>

16:40.680 --> 16:44.440
<b><i>That last kick was really powerful.</i></b>

16:44.440 --> 16:46.940
<b><i>If the armor hadn't absorbed it, 
I would have died.</i></b>

16:47.650 --> 16:50.730
<b><i>But now I can finally return.</i></b>

16:57.910 --> 16:59.200
<b><i>A Danger Beast?</i></b>

16:59.200 --> 17:01.450
<b><i>Damn! Why now, of all times?</i></b>

17:01.950 --> 17:02.790
<b><i>It's no use.</i></b>

17:02.790 --> 17:05.290
<b><i>I'm too beat up to fight.</i></b>

17:05.750 --> 17:06.630
<b><i>It's gonna kill me!</i></b>

17:09.920 --> 17:11.880
<b>A-Akame?</b>

17:12.590 --> 17:14.840
<b>Tatsumi, are you all right?</b>

17:14.840 --> 17:16.890
<b>Why are you here?</b>

17:16.890 --> 17:19.350
<b>We've been watching you from a distance.</b>

17:20.640 --> 17:22.560
<b>I see.</b>

17:22.560 --> 17:24.810
<b>All that just for me.</b>

17:24.810 --> 17:26.310
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

17:26.310 --> 17:29.270
<b>You had to come to my rescue again.</b>

17:31.980 --> 17:34.190
<b>I'll always come to save you.</b>

17:34.190 --> 17:35.240
<b>After all, we're comrades.</b>

17:40.450 --> 17:41.490
<b>Thanks.</b>

17:41.490 --> 17:42.790
<b>What for?</b>

17:42.790 --> 17:46.420
<b>I just felt so relieved to see your face.</b>

17:50.000 --> 17:51.420
<b>Welcome back, Tatsumi.</b>

17:52.090 --> 17:53.710
<b>Yeah. Glad to be back.</b>

17:56.010 --> 17:57.130
<b>Bam!</b>

17:57.550 --> 18:00.100
<b>We should get outta here first, right?</b>

18:00.100 --> 18:01.470
<b>Come on, this way!</b>

18:03.350 --> 18:05.890
<b>Lubbock, thanks for coming.</b>

18:05.890 --> 18:07.190
<b>Yeah, well...</b>

18:07.190 --> 18:10.110
<b>It was kinda my fault for suggesting the tournament in the first place.</b>

18:10.110 --> 18:13.070
<b>And with you gone, 
I'd have been the only man.</b>

18:13.070 --> 18:16.030
<b>Though I wouldn't have minded having a harem of my own.</b>

18:16.030 --> 18:17.400
<b>That's harsh.</b>

18:17.860 --> 18:21.330
<b>Despite what he says, 
he was pretty worried about you.</b>

18:22.830 --> 18:24.870
<b>Yeah, I know.</b>

18:25.250 --> 18:26.620
<b><i>Night Raid...</i></b>

18:27.160 --> 18:30.130
<b><i>This is where I truly belong.</i></b>

18:32.210 --> 18:34.300
<b>Um, how do I say this?</b>

18:34.630 --> 18:36.880
<b>I'm deeply sorry.</b>

18:37.670 --> 18:40.550
<b>I've reflected on my actions!</b>

18:40.550 --> 18:43.810
<b>Letting Tatsumi escape in your distraction was bad enough.</b>

18:43.810 --> 18:48.140
<b>But allowing the Night Raid member to get away was truly deplorable.</b>

18:48.140 --> 18:49.440
<b>Kurome, another block.</b>

18:52.190 --> 18:57.240
<b>Wave, your body is skilled, 
but your mind is weak.</b>

18:57.860 --> 18:59.320
<b>Take responsibility for your mistakes.</b>

18:59.320 --> 19:00.320
<b>Yes, ma'am.</b>

19:00.320 --> 19:02.740
<b>If you fail again,</b>

19:03.330 --> 19:05.910
<b>I shall personally administer your punishment.</b>

19:05.910 --> 19:08.120
<b>Keep that in mind.</b>

19:08.120 --> 19:08.870
<b>Yes, ma'am.</b>

19:08.870 --> 19:09.870
<b>Captain!</b>

19:09.870 --> 19:11.210
<b>My apologies!</b>

19:11.210 --> 19:13.090
<b>Not even Coro could track them!</b>

19:13.090 --> 19:15.880
<b>Hecatoncheir is primarily a combat Relic.</b>

19:15.880 --> 19:16.960
<b>Don't worry about it.</b>

19:16.960 --> 19:18.880
<b>And what about Stylish?</b>

19:18.880 --> 19:21.260
<b>He still hasn't gotten back to me.</b>

19:21.260 --> 19:23.550
<b>Sounds like we don't have much hope.</b>

19:23.550 --> 19:26.850
<b>Captain, regarding Tatsumi...</b>

19:27.470 --> 19:30.770
<b>If he were to resurface as our enemy,</b>

19:30.770 --> 19:33.730
<b>how should we handle him?</b>

19:34.730 --> 19:37.860
<b>To be honest, I love Tatsumi, even now.</b>

19:38.570 --> 19:41.820
<b>Perhaps that feeling is intensified 
because he's no longer within my reach.{todokanai tatsumi}</b>

19:42.240 --> 19:45.660
<b>However, my subordinates' lives take priority.</b>

19:45.660 --> 19:47.540
<b>Capturing him alive would be ideal,</b>

19:47.540 --> 19:49.200
<b>but do whatever you need to.</b>

19:49.750 --> 19:50.750
<b>Understood.</b>

19:50.750 --> 19:53.830
<b>If he should be tainted by evil, we'll have no choice.</b>

19:54.540 --> 19:58.800
<b><i>If you're weak enough to be killed by them, then so be it.</i></b>

19:58.800 --> 20:01.010
<b><i>But you're stronger than that.</i></b>

20:03.180 --> 20:05.720
<b><i>You have the will to survive.</i></b>

20:09.100 --> 20:10.730
<b><i>It's quite strange.</i></b>

20:11.230 --> 20:14.730
<b><i>I'm sure we'll meet again, Tatsumi.</i></b>

20:15.230 --> 20:17.570
<b><i>No, I'll make sure we do.</i></b>

20:18.150 --> 20:21.240
<b><i>And when that time comes, 
you'll answer to my feelings.</i></b>

20:21.240 --> 20:23.160
<b><i>Prepare yourself, Tatsumi.</i></b>

20:26.120 --> 20:29.870
<b>And that's what I saw of the Jaegers' strength.</b>

20:29.870 --> 20:33.290
<b>Damn, so they really are all Relic-wielders.</b>

20:33.290 --> 20:34.370
<b>This is gonna be tough.</b>

20:34.790 --> 20:36.840
<b>I can't believe Kurome is one of them.</b>

20:36.840 --> 20:40.130
<b>Why didn't you escape the capital together?</b>

20:40.130 --> 20:41.590
<b>I asked her to come with me, of course.</b>

20:42.170 --> 20:44.430
<b>But my sister chose to stay.</b>

20:45.180 --> 20:47.550
<b>From her perspective,</b>

20:47.550 --> 20:49.770
<b>I am the traitor.</b>

20:50.600 --> 20:54.230
<b><i>So when Zank used his illusions on her, she saw Kurome.</i></b>

20:54.230 --> 20:58.520
<b>And? How strong were they individually?</b>

20:59.070 --> 21:03.150
<b>The individual Jaegers are each about as strong as we are.</b>

21:03.150 --> 21:04.240
<b>However...</b>

21:04.240 --> 21:07.370
<b>Esdeath's on an entirely different level.</b>

21:07.370 --> 21:10.740
<b>Honestly, if I faced her now, I doubt I'd win.</b>

21:10.740 --> 21:12.750
<b>Esdeath is indeed powerful.</b>

21:13.210 --> 21:14.870
<b>But she has a weakness.</b>

21:15.290 --> 21:16.250
<b>What is it?</b>

21:16.670 --> 21:18.380
<b>The fact that she's alive.</b>

21:18.380 --> 21:20.250
<b>She has a heart and a pulse.</b>

21:21.210 --> 21:21.960
<b>That...</b>

21:22.420 --> 21:23.970
<b>is all I need to kill her.</b>

21:24.840 --> 21:27.340
<b>Even if she's the empire's strongest!</b>

21:32.020 --> 21:36.440
<b>You made a commendable effort 
to cover your tracks,</b>

21:36.440 --> 21:39.520
<b>but my enhanced soldiers can pick up even the faintest of scents.</b>

21:41.110 --> 21:44.490
<b>I knew he was suspicious 
the moment I laid eyes on him.</b>

21:44.490 --> 21:48.240
<b>He adapted far too quickly 
for a simple blacksmith.</b>

21:49.120 --> 21:50.240
<b>Bingo!</b>

21:51.030 --> 21:53.790
<b>You better believe I just found 
Night Raid's hideout.</b>

21:55.000 --> 21:55.040
{ED first frame}
