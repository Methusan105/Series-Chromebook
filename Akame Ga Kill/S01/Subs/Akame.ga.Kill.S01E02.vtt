<b>Wait, is that an evil-bird she's eating?</b>

04:53.270 --> 04:54.480

<b>Yo.</b>

05:28.260 --> 05:29.350
<b>Welcome back!</b>

05:29.350 --> 05:30.810
<b>Did you bring any souvenirs?</b>

05:30.810 --> 05:32.720
<b>One moment, Leone.</b>

05:33.180 --> 05:37.480
<b>I hear you exceeded the time limit on the job three days ago.</b>

05:37.690 --> 05:38.600
<b><i>Crap!</i></b>

05:43.940 --> 05:48.030
<b>I wouldn't recommend taking too much pleasure in fighting.</b>

05:48.030 --> 05:49.870
<b>It's a habit you should try to break.</b>

05:49.870 --> 05:52.830
<b>Okay! Just stop reeling me in!{youtu.be/rDH78xpLa2I}</b>

05:52.830 --> 05:54.950
<b>Anyway, who's this young man?</b>

05:55.250 --> 05:57.960
<b>He has great talent, Boss!</b>

05:57.960 --> 05:59.460
<b>Hey, stop that!</b>

05:59.460 --> 06:01.000
<b>You think he shows promise?</b>

06:01.920 --> 06:03.210
<b>I do.</b>

06:06.360 --> 06:08.840
<b>Well, just give it a try.</b>

06:08.840 --> 06:09.430
<b>Okay?</b>

06:09.430 --> 06:10.600
<b>What is this, a part-time job?!</b>

06:12.260 --> 06:14.350
<b>Akame, gather the others.</b>

06:14.850 --> 06:17.850
<b>I want your report, along with 
more details on this young man.</b>

06:19.770 --> 06:20.810
<b>Very well.</b>

06:20.810 --> 06:22.690
<b>I understand the situation.</b>

06:22.690 --> 06:23.860
<b>Tatsumi...</b>

06:23.860 --> 06:25.900
<b>Would you like to join Night Raid?</b>

06:26.320 --> 06:28.320
<b>If I say no, I'm dead, right?</b>

06:28.320 --> 06:30.070
<b>No, that isn't the case.</b>

06:30.490 --> 06:32.740
<b>But that doesn't mean we can let you go.</b>

06:32.740 --> 06:36.000
<b>We'll employ you in our workshop instead.</b>

06:36.000 --> 06:38.620
<b>Either way, though, we're not going to kill you.</b>

06:38.620 --> 06:41.540
<b>With that in mind, what do you say?</b>

06:42.880 --> 06:43.630
<b>I...</b>

06:44.670 --> 06:46.960
<b>I was supposed to go to the imperial capital</b>

06:46.960 --> 06:50.380
<b>and make enough money to save my village from poverty.</b>

06:50.380 --> 06:51.970
<b>But the capital...</b>

06:51.970 --> 06:53.350
<b>Tatsumi.</b>

06:53.930 --> 06:58.140
<b>The cause of this nation's poverty 
and suffering lies at its corrupt heart.</b>

06:58.140 --> 07:01.350
<b>Wouldn't you rather strike 
at the root of the problem?</b>

07:01.350 --> 07:02.310
<b>As a man!</b>

07:02.730 --> 07:06.360
<b>Bulat was once a skilled imperial soldier.</b>

07:06.360 --> 07:10.490
<b>But when he discovered the empire's corruption, 
he joined our ranks.</b>

07:11.160 --> 07:15.910
<b>Our job is to eliminate the evil in the capital.</b>

07:15.910 --> 07:19.540
<b>Beats working for a corrupt empire, 
wouldn't you say?</b>

07:19.540 --> 07:20.670
<b>But...</b>

07:20.670 --> 07:25.460
<b>You can't change the world just by 
knocking off a few bad guys.</b>

07:25.460 --> 07:29.260
<b>You'll never save lesser-known areas 
like my village this way.</b>

07:29.260 --> 07:30.470
<b>I see.</b>

07:30.470 --> 07:33.340
<b>Night Raid might be an even 
better fit for you than you think.</b>

07:33.340 --> 07:35.180
<b>Wh-Why would that be?</b>

07:35.470 --> 07:37.390
<b>There is an anti-Imperial force,</b>

07:37.390 --> 07:41.100
<b>the Revolutionary Army, whose headquarters lie to the far south of the capital.</b>

07:41.100 --> 07:42.350
<b>The Revolutionary Army?</b>

07:42.900 --> 07:48.070
<b>Though they started small, the Army has grown into an organization of considerable size.</b>

07:48.230 --> 07:51.780
<b>Thus, they needed a smaller team to carry out covert operations</b>

07:51.780 --> 07:54.780
<b>such as intelligence gathering and assassination.</b>

07:54.780 --> 07:57.700
<b>That team is us: Night Raid.</b>

07:58.740 --> 08:01.580
<b>Though we are currently 
charged with mere pest control,</b>

08:01.580 --> 08:04.330
<b>once we mobilize, 
we'll use the ensuing confusion</b>

08:04.330 --> 08:08.250
<b>to reach the prime minister and crush the empire's corruption at its source.</b>

08:08.800 --> 08:10.720
<b>Crush it at the source...</b>

08:11.010 --> 08:14.140
<b>And at that moment, 
this nation will be born anew.</b>

08:16.050 --> 08:20.770
<b>Will this new nation treat its citizens well?</b>

08:20.770 --> 08:21.850
<b>Of course.</b>

08:22.140 --> 08:24.020
<b>I see. That's incredible.</b>

08:24.020 --> 08:28.730
<b>So the killing you do now is basically finding the bad guys and taking out the trash.</b>

08:29.110 --> 08:32.400
<b>In other words, you're heroic assassins, 
fighting for justice! {fucking eh oh el}</b>

08:33.990 --> 08:35.200
<b>Wh-What is it?</b>

08:35.740 --> 08:37.160
<b>What's so funny?</b>

08:37.830 --> 08:39.290
<b>Tatsumi...</b>

08:39.290 --> 08:43.120
<b>No matter how you spin it, 
we commit murder.</b>

08:43.410 --> 08:46.000
<b>There's no justice in something like that.</b>

08:46.000 --> 08:51.010
<b>Any one of us could be executed for our crimes, 
and none would lift a finger.</b>

08:51.010 --> 08:53.260
<b>What a naÃ¯ve fool.</b>

08:53.260 --> 08:56.140
<b>He could never work with us.</b>

08:56.390 --> 08:57.340
<b>Wait a second.</b>

08:57.340 --> 08:58.510
<b>Huh?</b>

08:58.680 --> 08:59.680
<b>I'm...</b>

09:00.390 --> 09:03.060
<b>Each one of us has a reason to fight.</b>

09:03.060 --> 09:04.850
<b>We're all prepared for what could happen.</b>

09:05.600 --> 09:07.810
<b>Do you have the same resolve?</b>

09:09.110 --> 09:10.820
<b>I will be compensated, won't I?</b>

09:10.820 --> 09:11.780
<b>You will.</b>

09:11.780 --> 09:15.320
<b>If you work hard, I'm sure 
you'll be able to save your village.{maybe join 169+170}</b>

09:15.320 --> 09:16.820
<b>Then I'll do it!</b>

09:16.820 --> 09:18.570
<b>Let me join Night Raid!</b>

09:18.910 --> 09:21.700
<b>You may never be able to return to that village of yours, you know.</b>

09:21.700 --> 09:22.870
<b>That's fine.</b>

09:22.870 --> 09:25.710
<b>As long as everyone there can live happily, it doesn't matter.</b>

09:27.120 --> 09:28.380
<b>It's decided, then.</b>

09:28.380 --> 09:30.420
<b>Welcome to the bloody life of an assassin,</b>

09:30.880 --> 09:32.380
<b>Tatsumi.</b>

09:32.880 --> 09:34.920
<b>This meeting is adjourned for tonight.</b>

09:34.920 --> 09:36.220
<b>Akame.</b>

09:36.720 --> 09:39.010
<b>I'll leave Tatsumi's training to you.</b>

09:40.140 --> 09:42.430
<b>If he becomes a burden, feel free to kill him.</b>

09:42.430 --> 09:43.350
<b>Understood.</b>

09:43.350 --> 09:45.640
<b><i>What do you mean, "Understood"?</i></b>

09:45.640 --> 09:47.900
<b>Work hard, 'cos your life depends on it!</b>

09:49.310 --> 09:52.360
<b><i>I'll be working with </i>her?</b>

09:55.530 --> 09:57.570
<b>Let's learn as many skills as possible</b>

09:57.570 --> 10:00.070
<b>so we can climb the army's ranks.</b>

10:00.070 --> 10:04.700
<b>If we learn all about food, 
we're less likely to go hungry.</b>

10:05.290 --> 10:06.330
<b><i>Sayo...</i></b>

10:06.330 --> 10:07.500
<b><i>Ieyasu...</i></b>

10:07.500 --> 10:10.210
<b><i>I'm so glad I learned how to cook.</i></b>

10:10.210 --> 10:12.000
<b>Hey! Where's my second helping?</b>

10:12.000 --> 10:12.920
<b>Oh, bring me some too!</b>

10:12.920 --> 10:13.800
<b>Same here.</b>

10:13.800 --> 10:15.550
<b>Please!</b>

10:15.550 --> 10:17.260
<b><i>It's like I'm only here to cook!</i></b>

10:17.840 --> 10:19.010
<b>Damn it!</b>

10:19.010 --> 10:21.680
<b>I'm supposed to be an assassin, 
but I've barely left the kitchen!</b>

10:21.680 --> 10:23.180
<b>No point in complaining.</b>

10:23.180 --> 10:25.390
<b>You're with me, and I'm in charge of the food.</b>

10:25.770 --> 10:28.690
<b>You're only in charge of the food 
so you can snack on everything, aren't you?</b>

10:28.690 --> 10:30.190
<b>Of course not.</b>

10:31.020 --> 10:32.610
<b>Somehow I don't believe you.</b>

10:32.610 --> 10:36.280
<b>That outfit really suits a newbie like you.</b>

10:36.280 --> 10:37.150
<b>What did you say?!</b>

10:37.650 --> 10:38.950
<b>Hey, Tatsumi!</b>

10:38.950 --> 10:39.950
<b>Bulat...</b>

10:40.160 --> 10:41.410
<b>Huh?</b>

10:41.410 --> 10:42.580
<b>Are you all going somewhere?</b>

10:42.580 --> 10:44.950
<b>Yeah. We're on an emergency assignment.</b>

10:44.950 --> 10:45.740
<b>An assignment?</b>

10:45.740 --> 10:46.330
<b>What about me?</b>

10:46.660 --> 10:47.830
<b>You can hold the fort, newbie!</b>

10:47.830 --> 10:50.420
<b>Just keep chopping those cucumbers or whatever.</b>

10:50.750 --> 10:54.040
<b><i>What's </i>her<i> problem, anyway?</i></b>

10:54.420 --> 10:55.380
<b>Bye, now!</b>

10:57.300 --> 10:58.170
<b>Wow.{..}</b>

10:58.170 --> 10:59.590
<b>This is a nice place.</b>

11:00.220 --> 11:02.430
<b>Today, we'll gather our prey from this lake.</b>

11:09.390 --> 11:10.940
<b>Why are you panicking?</b>

11:11.190 --> 11:11.690
<b>Huh?</b>

11:16.030 --> 11:17.650
<b>Oh, you had a swimsuit on.</b>

11:17.650 --> 11:19.490
<b>Today, our target is the Koga tuna.</b>

11:19.490 --> 11:20.700
<b>This is the best location.</b>

11:20.700 --> 11:23.910
<b>Aren't those fish even harder 
to catch than they are to find?</b>

11:33.960 --> 11:36.000
<b>B-Burst fishing?!</b>

11:40.300 --> 11:42.800
<b>Dive into the depths of the lake and remain absolutely still.</b>

11:42.800 --> 11:45.600
<b>The moment your prey draws near, you strike.</b>

11:45.600 --> 11:47.140
<b>Concentration is the key.</b>

11:47.810 --> 11:48.770
<b>Can you do it?</b>

11:49.600 --> 11:51.440
<b>Bring it on!</b>

11:51.980 --> 11:52.900
<b>So...</b>

11:52.900 --> 11:56.020
<b>In the end, Tatsumi only caught two fish.</b>

11:56.610 --> 11:59.690
<b>I heard you tore your clothes off 
and yelled, "Bring it on!"</b>

11:59.690 --> 12:01.400
<b>You're still far too naÃ¯ve.</b>

12:01.700 --> 12:02.910
<b><i>Damn it.</i></b>

12:02.910 --> 12:06.030
<b><i>I never know what she's thinking.{maybe join 237+238 and add ellipses}</i></b>

12:06.030 --> 12:07.370
<b><i>I really don't understand her.</i></b>

12:07.370 --> 12:10.080
<b>All right, Leone. Let's hear this case of yours.</b>

12:10.080 --> 12:10.870
<b>Very well.</b>

12:11.080 --> 12:15.460
<b>The targets this time are Ogre, of the imperial police, 
and Gamal, an oil merchant.</b>

12:15.460 --> 12:17.040
<b>According to our client...</b>

12:18.550 --> 12:22.680
<b>Gamal, the oil merchant, has been paying Ogre a huge amount in bribes.</b>

12:23.050 --> 12:26.390
<b>Each time Gamal commits a crime,</b>

12:26.390 --> 12:29.640
<b>Ogre pins the blame on an innocent person.</b>

12:30.350 --> 12:34.310
<b>My fiancÃ© was one of them, 
executed for a crime he didn't commit.</b>

12:35.270 --> 12:36.360
<b>Please...</b>

12:36.360 --> 12:37.940
<b>Please right this injustice!</b>

12:39.110 --> 12:40.190
<b>Understood.</b>

12:40.190 --> 12:42.740
<b>I'll send them both to Hell.</b>

12:42.990 --> 12:46.570
<b>Thank you so much. Thank you so much!</b>

12:49.240 --> 12:52.040
<b>This is the payment.</b>

12:52.040 --> 12:53.620
<b>That's quite a lot.</b>

12:54.330 --> 12:55.790
<b>She smelled of disease.</b>

12:56.500 --> 12:58.840
<b>I imagine she sold her body 
many times to earn this.</b>

12:59.960 --> 13:00.880
<b>No way...</b>

13:00.880 --> 13:02.510
<b>Have you verified the case?</b>

13:02.510 --> 13:04.760
<b>I confirmed her words myself.</b>

13:04.760 --> 13:05.800
<b>The targets are guilty.</b>

13:07.300 --> 13:08.140
<b>All right.</b>

13:08.140 --> 13:10.850
<b>Night Raid accepts the case.</b>

13:10.850 --> 13:14.690
<b>Our new nation has no need of such scum.</b>

13:14.690 --> 13:16.150
<b>We shall bring divine punishment upon them.</b>

13:16.730 --> 13:19.440
<b>The merchant, Gamal, should be easy.</b>

13:19.440 --> 13:21.530
<b>But Ogre will be a formidable opponent.</b>

13:22.440 --> 13:23.740
<b>Ogre, the Demon.</b>

13:23.740 --> 13:26.950
<b>He's a highly skilled swordsman that even criminals fear.</b>

13:28.070 --> 13:32.040
<b>Normally surrounded by lackeys, he is rarely seen alone.</b>

13:32.580 --> 13:34.410
<b>A cautious man by nature,</b>

13:34.410 --> 13:37.370
<b>he only collects Gamal's money in the privacy of his room.</b>

13:37.710 --> 13:41.340
<b>When he's off duty, he drinks on Main Street.</b>

13:42.000 --> 13:45.130
<b>It seems like that's the best time for us to strike.</b>

13:45.130 --> 13:48.390
<b>However, security is tight that close to the palace.</b>

13:48.390 --> 13:51.560
<b>It would be dangerous for someone like Akame, 
whose face is publicly known.</b>

13:51.560 --> 13:52.390
<b>Hey, hey!</b>

13:52.930 --> 13:55.100
<b>I'm not on any wanted posters!</b>

13:55.100 --> 13:56.140
<b>Can you do it?</b>

13:56.140 --> 13:58.900
<b>The stronger the enemy, 
the more I wanna take 'em down!</b>

13:58.900 --> 14:01.320
<b>Why not wait for Mine and the rest?</b>

14:01.320 --> 14:04.690
<b>But we don't know when they'll return, right?</b>

14:04.690 --> 14:05.360
<b>Yeah.</b>

14:05.360 --> 14:08.360
<b>Then let's just do it ourselves!</b>

14:08.360 --> 14:09.620
<b>Oh?</b>

14:09.620 --> 14:11.870
<b>Are you saying you'll defeat Ogre?</b>

14:11.870 --> 14:12.240
<b>Eh?</b>

14:12.240 --> 14:13.740
<b>Sounded like you were offering.</b>

14:13.740 --> 14:16.790
<b>You'd better be able to live up to those words!</b>

14:16.790 --> 14:17.830
<b>Huh?</b>

14:17.830 --> 14:19.790
<b>Right now, this job is beyond you.</b>

14:20.540 --> 14:22.250
<b>I'm a fair hand with a sword, you know.</b>

14:22.250 --> 14:25.130
<b>But can you bring yourself to kill a person?</b>

14:26.510 --> 14:27.840
<b>I already have.</b>

14:29.470 --> 14:31.760
<b>You swung your sword out of hatred.</b>

14:32.390 --> 14:35.600
<b>Are you saying you can kill 
without hesitation at any time?</b>

14:36.430 --> 14:38.310
<b>While we sit here talking,</b>

14:38.310 --> 14:42.310
<b>he could be out there framing more people, right?</b>

14:42.310 --> 14:43.690
<b>That's why I have to do something.</b>

14:44.190 --> 14:46.860
<b>More people could unjustly lose their loved ones.</b>

14:46.860 --> 14:49.570
<b>I can't allow anyone else to go through that pain!</b>

14:49.990 --> 14:50.990
<b>Then it's decided.</b>

14:51.450 --> 14:53.120
<b>Tatsumi, prove your words with deeds.</b>

14:53.530 --> 14:54.830
<b>Eliminate Ogre.</b>

14:54.830 --> 14:56.370
<b>Nicely said, Tatsumi!</b>

14:56.370 --> 14:58.330
<b>You show great resolve!</b>

14:58.660 --> 15:01.420
<b>Leone and Akame, deal with the oil merchant.</b>

15:01.420 --> 15:02.500
<b>Got it!</b>

15:02.500 --> 15:04.090
<b>Roger that.</b>

15:05.050 --> 15:06.380
<b>How's that, Akame?</b>

15:06.380 --> 15:08.840
<b>When I say something, I mean it!</b>

15:08.840 --> 15:13.970
<b>You're not a real assassin until you've completed your first job and made your report.</b>

15:13.970 --> 15:16.180
<b>If you get too cocky before then,</b>

15:16.520 --> 15:17.390
<b>you'll die.</b>

15:21.310 --> 15:22.650
<b><i>Damn it.</i></b>

15:22.650 --> 15:26.320
<b><i>I'll finish the job, no matter what, and win their respect with it.</i></b>

15:29.360 --> 15:31.280
<b>This is Main Street.</b>

15:31.740 --> 15:33.780
<b>You have the map memorized, right?</b>

15:33.780 --> 15:35.240
<b>Yeah. Back to front.</b>

15:36.740 --> 15:38.450
<b>If you get too cocky before then,</b>

15:38.750 --> 15:39.660
<b>you'll die.</b>

15:42.670 --> 15:46.550
<b>Tatsumi, I should tell you about Akame's past.</b>

15:47.420 --> 15:48.880
<b>When Akame was a child,</b>

15:48.880 --> 15:51.510
<b>she and her sister were bought by the empire.</b>

15:52.680 --> 15:55.260
<b>She was forced into an assassin-training program,</b>

15:55.260 --> 15:57.390
<b>along with many other children like her,</b>

15:57.390 --> 15:59.020
<b>and trained to kill.</b>

15:59.020 --> 16:01.560
<b>She managed to survive that hellish experience</b>

16:04.020 --> 16:10.070
<b>and emerged as an assassin who worked at the bidding of the empire.</b>

16:10.530 --> 16:14.740
<b>However, as Akame carried out her missions, she began to sense the empire's true nature.</b>

16:14.740 --> 16:17.120
<b>It was one of her targetsâ€”
our bossâ€”who persuaded her</b>

16:17.120 --> 16:21.500
<b>to defect to the Revolutionary Army, who stood up for the citizens.</b>

16:23.960 --> 16:28.210
<b>But by that time, most of the comrades she grew up with had died.</b>

16:29.170 --> 16:30.760
<b>Do you understand what I'm trying to say?</b>

16:31.470 --> 16:35.550
<b>You think I'm too complacent for a professional killer.</b>

16:37.510 --> 16:41.350
<b>Well, if you get through today in one piece, 
I'm sure you'll understand.</b>

16:44.520 --> 16:45.980
<b>Whew!</b>

16:45.980 --> 16:48.360
<b>Now that I've pissed my worries away,</b>

16:48.360 --> 16:50.860
<b>maybe I'll get some more action.</b>

16:50.860 --> 16:51.570
<b>Yeah.</b>

16:51.570 --> 16:53.490
<b>I'll show you some action, Gamal!</b>

16:56.370 --> 16:59.240
<b>Two girls at once, you lucky dog.</b>

17:02.700 --> 17:03.660
<b>Now, then...</b>

17:03.660 --> 17:07.380
<b>I wonder how Tatsumi's doing with the other target.</b>

17:07.380 --> 17:08.630
<b>Phew!</b>

17:08.630 --> 17:11.760
<b>Nothin' beats a nice, cool drink 
after a long, thorough interrogation.{a hard day's policin' needs a big, cold beer. and the best cold beer is vic.}</b>

17:12.010 --> 17:13.510
<b>Excuse me. Ogre, sir?</b>

17:13.510 --> 17:14.470
<b>Huh?</b>

17:14.970 --> 17:17.970
<b>There's something I'd like to ask you.</b>

17:17.970 --> 17:19.760
<b>What's that? Spit it out.</b>

17:21.060 --> 17:22.850
<b>But not here in public.</b>

17:22.850 --> 17:23.680
<b>Hmm?</b>

17:28.230 --> 17:30.440
<b><i>Doesn't seem like there's anyone else nearby.</i></b>

17:30.440 --> 17:31.280
<b>Hey, kid!</b>

17:31.650 --> 17:33.110
<b>This place should be fine.</b>

17:33.110 --> 17:34.530
<b>Yes, it should.</b>

17:35.490 --> 17:37.280
<b><i>Sayo, Ieyasu...</i></b>

17:37.280 --> 17:38.660
<b><i>Lend me your strength.</i></b>

17:40.200 --> 17:41.240
<b>I beg you!{PLS}</b>

17:41.240 --> 17:43.450
<b>Please recruit me into the Imperial Army!</b>

17:43.450 --> 17:46.540
<b>I have to earn money for my poor village!</b>

17:48.330 --> 17:50.630
<b>I figured it was somethin' like that.</b>

17:50.630 --> 17:52.880
<b>Apply at the barracks like everyone else, numbskull!</b>

17:53.510 --> 17:54.510
<b>I would, but...</b>

17:55.130 --> 17:57.800
<b>It's too hard to get accepted in this recession.</b>

17:58.050 --> 17:59.970
<b>That's too bad.{Blame yourself or God.}{draw your sword, ramza}</b>

18:05.140 --> 18:07.810
<b>Guess you're just not strong enough!</b>

18:10.440 --> 18:11.320
<b><i>What speed!</i></b>

18:11.650 --> 18:14.110
<b><i>He struck me with everything he had, 
heedless of his own safety.</i></b>

18:14.110 --> 18:18.070
<b><i>I can't believe he dared to 
raise his blade against me.</i></b>

18:21.450 --> 18:22.530
<b>I did it!</b>

18:22.990 --> 18:27.330
<b>You're not a real assassin until you've completed your first job and made your report.</b>

18:27.660 --> 18:28.790
<b>Oh, that's right.</b>

18:29.250 --> 18:31.290
<b>I have to report this at once.</b>

18:39.010 --> 18:40.300
<b>Did you think that I,</b>

18:40.300 --> 18:41.600
<b>the great Ogre,</b>

18:41.600 --> 18:45.140
<b>would fall so easily to a weakling like you?!</b>

18:46.890 --> 18:52.440
<b>I bet you're one of those anti-imperial dogs, 
Night Raid, aren't you?</b>

18:52.900 --> 18:55.980
<b>You weaklings can yap all you like about injustice,</b>

18:55.980 --> 18:58.650
<b>but in this city, might makes right!</b>

18:58.650 --> 19:00.990
<b>I'm the one who holds the fate of others in my hands!</b>

19:00.990 --> 19:02.950
<b>You will never hold mine in yours!</b>

19:04.990 --> 19:07.000
<b>Stop spewing nonsense!</b>

19:15.840 --> 19:18.010
<b>Who hired you, I wonder?</b>

19:18.010 --> 19:21.930
<b>Given the timing, I'm guessing it was the fiancÃ©e of the guy I just disposed of.</b>

19:22.510 --> 19:24.350
<b>Nailed it, huh?</b>

19:24.350 --> 19:28.390
<b>I knew I shoulda taken care of her too.</b>

19:28.390 --> 19:31.310
<b>But hey, I guess it's not too late even now.</b>

19:31.560 --> 19:34.020
<b>I'm gonna hunt down that bitch,</b>

19:34.020 --> 19:36.940
<b>have her entire family arrested,</b>

19:36.940 --> 19:40.200
<b>and then execute them 
one by one before her very eyes!</b>

19:40.450 --> 19:42.910
<b>But first, I'll cut you down where you stand!</b>

19:45.580 --> 19:47.790
<b><i>These guys are all the same.</i></b>

19:47.790 --> 19:50.370
<b><i>They take power granted by authority</i></b>

19:50.370 --> 19:52.920
<b><i>and exploit it for personal gain.</i></b>

19:53.420 --> 19:55.540
<b><i>I will eradicate...</i></b>

19:56.460 --> 19:57.380
<b><i>trash like you...</i></b>

19:58.630 --> 19:59.920
<b><i>from this world!</i></b>

20:14.230 --> 20:16.730
<b>I commend you for successfully eliminating the target.</b>

20:16.730 --> 20:17.730
<b>Excellent work.</b>

20:17.730 --> 20:18.440
<b>Thanks!</b>

20:18.440 --> 20:19.740
<b>What do you think, Akame?</b>

20:19.740 --> 20:21.570
<b>I completed the job and made my report.</b>

20:21.570 --> 20:23.990
<b>Not a scratch on me.</b>

20:23.990 --> 20:25.740
<b>Come, let me hear your approval!</b>

20:26.780 --> 20:27.370
<b>Huh?</b>

20:28.870 --> 20:29.540
<b>What is this?</b>

20:29.540 --> 20:30.580
<b>What are you doing?!</b>

20:30.580 --> 20:32.080
<b>Leone, Boss, restrain him.</b>

20:32.710 --> 20:34.120
<b>No!</b>

20:34.620 --> 20:35.880
<b>What? What is it?</b>

20:41.470 --> 20:42.550
<b>Thank goodness.</b>

20:46.640 --> 20:49.010
<b>I once had a friend who was 
too proud to report his wounds.</b>

20:49.010 --> 20:51.890
<b>They were poisoned, and he died.</b>

20:51.890 --> 20:54.060
<b>I'm glad to see you're unhurt.</b>

20:54.060 --> 20:56.980
<b>First missions have a high mortality rate.</b>

20:57.400 --> 20:58.320
<b>You've done well.</b>

20:58.320 --> 21:00.530
<b>Th-Thanks.</b>

21:03.280 --> 21:07.490
<b>Akame was hard on you 
because she didn't want you to die.</b>

21:07.990 --> 21:10.080
<b>Cooking is all about communication,</b>

21:10.580 --> 21:13.080
<b>and hunting prey is the most 
basic element of assassination.</b>

21:13.080 --> 21:16.880
<b>Haven't you realized that everything she did was part of your training?</b>

21:16.880 --> 21:19.000
<b>Huh? R-Really?</b>

21:19.800 --> 21:21.380
<b>I'm sorry, Akame.</b>

21:21.380 --> 21:23.420
<b>I misunderstood.</b>

21:23.880 --> 21:24.630
<b>It's fine.</b>

21:25.630 --> 21:28.220
<b>Just keep coming back alive, Tatsumi.</b>

21:28.220 --> 21:31.680
<b>Right. I hope we can build a strong relationship together, Akame.</b>

21:32.720 --> 21:36.560
<b>What kind of relationship were you planning to build with your clothes off?</b>

21:36.560 --> 21:38.980
<b>You guys are the ones who stripped me!</b>

21:38.980 --> 21:39.730
<b>Okay.</b>

21:39.730 --> 21:42.730
<b>Next, you'll be trained by Mine. Good luck.</b>

21:42.730 --> 21:43.320
<b>Eh?</b>

21:43.690 --> 21:46.070
<b>Out of the frying pan and into the fire, huh?</b>

21:47.530 --> 21:49.570
<b>Her?!</b>

21:51.490 --> 21:53.910
<b>I just got a chill.</b>

musekinin yo shitteru

22:33.200 --> 22:37.660
I know your kindness lacks any responsibility

22:38.670 --> 22:43.990
tsuyoku nakya atashi wa ikiru imi mo nai

22:38.670 --> 22:43.990
If I can't be stronger, I have no reason to live

22:43.990 --> 22:48.720
isso kowashite yo

22:43.990 --> 22:48.720
So just break me already

22:50.640 --> 22:55.950
itoshisa de kokoro wa moroku nari

22:50.640 --> 22:55.950
Love makes my heart grow brittle

22:55.950 --> 23:01.420
nigiritsubuseru hodo yasashikutte

22:55.950 --> 23:01.420
So gentle it threatens to crush it

23:01.420 --> 23:11.730
dare ni mo mise ta koto nai yowa sa ga hitotsu dake kobore ta

23:01.420 --> 23:11.730
Of the weaknesses I've never shown anyone, one has come tumbling out

23:13.040 --> 23:17.920
donna itami mo gaman dekita no yo

23:13.040 --> 23:17.920
I've persevered through every sort of pain

23:17.920 --> 23:23.890
shiritaku nanka nakatta

23:17.920 --> 23:23.890
And I wish I'd never known any of it

23:35.100 --> 23:40.020
Kill   Your   Worries

23:35.100 --> 23:40.020
Kill   Your   Worries

23:35.100 --> 23:40.020
Kill   Your   Worries
