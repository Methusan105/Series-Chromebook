<b>She is on a completely different level.</b>

03:39.190 --> 03:41.240
<b>It's awe-inspiring!</b>

03:41.240 --> 03:42.280
<b>Water Spirit Cannon!</b>

03:43.660 --> 03:44.950
<b>How brazen!</b>

03:47.910 --> 03:49.830
<b>Ow, ow, ow...</b>

03:49.830 --> 03:53.040
<b>That armored guy is second only to Lady Esdeath in strength.</b>

03:53.460 --> 03:56.500
<b>But with all this water around, 
Liver can defeat him.</b>

03:56.960 --> 03:58.210
<b>I should back him up.</b>

03:58.210 --> 03:59.420
<b>Hold it!</b>

04:02.630 --> 04:06.300
<b>I'm not gonna hide behind him the whole time!</b>

04:06.600 --> 04:08.220
<b>This guy...</b>

04:08.220 --> 04:09.770
<b>Butt out!</b>

04:10.730 --> 04:12.060
<b>Night Raid...</b>

04:12.060 --> 04:13.480
<b>You're getting cocky!</b>

04:31.500 --> 04:34.080
<b><i>Damn! He's ridiculously fast!</i></b>

04:37.000 --> 04:37.790
<b><i>However...</i></b>

04:44.340 --> 04:46.010
<b>Akame is faster!</b>

04:46.300 --> 04:48.850
<b>Hmph! Don't compare me to some assassin!</b>

04:56.100 --> 04:59.770
<b><i>If I wasn't wounded already, 
this guy would be nothing.</i></b>

05:00.230 --> 05:03.950
<b><i>He's absurdly fast, given the condition he's in.</i></b>

05:03.950 --> 05:05.320
<b><i>The Three Beasts...</i></b>

05:05.320 --> 05:08.490
<b><i>Ogre was a pushover compared to these guys.</i></b>

05:20.040 --> 05:23.300
<b>Whoa, he's not messing around.</b>

05:24.130 --> 05:27.390
<b>As long as there's water around, Liver has the advantage!</b>

05:27.390 --> 05:30.810
<b>Yeah, right. Bro has this in the bag.</b>

05:30.810 --> 05:32.060
<b>Liver's gonna win!</b>

05:32.060 --> 05:33.310
<b>No, Bro's gonna win!</b>

05:33.310 --> 05:36.980
<b>Prepare to be crushed, Bulat!</b>

05:41.110 --> 05:42.860
<b>Ravine Serpent!</b>

05:58.250 --> 06:01.840
<b>I figured you'd attack the serpent head-on instead of dodging it,</b>

06:02.340 --> 06:05.880
<b>given the casualties it'd cause if it hit the boat.</b>

06:06.340 --> 06:11.970
<b>However, now that you're off the deck and in the air,</b>

06:11.970 --> 06:13.930
<b>there's no way you can dodge this!{how can he be airborne for the duration of an entire explanatory monologue}</b>

06:16.310 --> 06:17.980
<b>Dark Dragon Spear!</b>

06:26.360 --> 06:28.320
<b>A splash of water here and there</b>

06:28.320 --> 06:30.450
<b>isn't enough to quench my resolve!</b>

06:32.070 --> 06:33.200
<b>Indeed.</b>

06:33.200 --> 06:36.410
<b>That attack was hardly enough to defeat you.</b>

06:38.330 --> 06:40.460
<b>I am well aware of that.</b>

06:41.170 --> 06:44.670
<b>We have survived countless battles together.</b>

06:44.670 --> 06:49.590
<b>I understand your strength and your determination better than anyone.</b>

06:49.970 --> 06:52.050
<b>And that's precisely why...</b>

06:52.050 --> 06:56.470
<b>I'll have you taste my greatest technique!</b>

06:57.140 --> 06:59.140
<b>Water Dragon's Divine Conquest! {>screaming in high pressure water}</b>

07:14.160 --> 07:15.330
<b>Did I get him?</b>

07:16.950 --> 07:20.160
<b>If you have to ask yourself that question,</b>

07:20.160 --> 07:22.670
<b>the answer is always no!{lol}</b>

07:22.670 --> 07:24.000
<b>He survived it!</b>

07:35.930 --> 07:37.850
<b>Too bad.</b>

07:37.850 --> 07:40.640
<b>You missed your chance to take Liver out.</b>

07:42.850 --> 07:44.270
<b>Bro...</b>

07:45.270 --> 07:46.360
<b>Tatsumi?</b>

07:46.360 --> 07:48.900
<b>Forgive me, Bro.</b>

07:49.570 --> 07:53.200
<b>I wasn't able to hold him off long enough.{useless bitch}</b>

07:53.530 --> 07:54.570
<b>What's this?</b>

07:54.570 --> 07:56.330
<b>You can still move?</b>

07:56.950 --> 08:01.330
<b>I told you I'd play with you later if you kept still like a good boy.</b>

08:01.330 --> 08:02.960
<b>Don't worry about it.</b>

08:06.040 --> 08:09.300
<b>Surviving as long as you have 
with no Relic is impressive enough.{ah but doesn't having a relic make it easier to die}</b>

08:09.760 --> 08:10.800
<b>Bro...</b>

08:11.630 --> 08:14.260
<b><i>Even with all that armor, 
he's pretty badly wounded.</i></b>

08:14.640 --> 08:19.770
<b>Looks like your Relic deactivates 
when it receives enough damage.</b>

08:20.470 --> 08:21.930
<b>It's clear who's come out on top.</b>

08:23.230 --> 08:25.150
<b>I wouldn't call the match just yet.</b>

08:25.690 --> 08:28.400
<b>You're bleeding from your ears, Liver.</b>

08:30.990 --> 08:35.570
<b>All those crazy techniques must have torn your body apart.</b>

08:36.370 --> 08:39.580
<b>That means you're in no condition to use your Relic either.</b>

08:40.750 --> 08:42.910
<b>You've seen right through me, huh?</b>

08:42.910 --> 08:46.130
<b>I was hoping to negotiate 
from a higher vantage point,</b>

08:47.920 --> 08:49.050
<b>but I'll simply ask.</b>

08:49.300 --> 08:53.550
<b>Bulat, can I interest you in joining Lady Esdeath's army?</b>

08:53.550 --> 08:56.720
<b>With your strength, you could rise to second-in-command.</b>

08:56.720 --> 09:00.390
<b>I have absolutely no desire 
to serve the empire again.</b>

09:00.390 --> 09:01.720
<b>Not the empire.</b>

09:01.720 --> 09:04.060
<b>Think of it as serving Lady Esdeath.</b>

09:04.940 --> 09:07.100
<b>That is how I was saved.</b>

09:07.100 --> 09:08.860
<b>You could do anything you pleased,</b>

09:08.860 --> 09:11.280
<b>and all would fear you.</b>

09:11.280 --> 09:12.070
<b>That's right.</b>

09:12.070 --> 09:16.610
<b>Even those filthy officials, 
spreading their poisonous ideals,</b>

09:16.610 --> 09:18.780
<b>would bow down before you!</b>

09:20.790 --> 09:23.200
<b>Come with me, Bulat!</b>

09:23.200 --> 09:26.290
<b>Lady Esdeath can absolve your crimes!</b>

09:26.750 --> 09:28.040
<b>I refuse.</b>

09:28.920 --> 09:31.000
<b>You may be comfortable with your current position,</b>

09:31.000 --> 09:33.800
<b>considering how you feel about the officials.</b>

09:35.340 --> 09:38.180
<b>But my job is to defend the citizens.</b>

09:38.180 --> 09:41.100
<b>If I were to join the Esdeath Army, in service of the prime minister...</b>

09:41.560 --> 09:43.520
<b>I wouldn't be able to say that anymore.</b>

09:44.480 --> 09:46.190
<b>Defend the citizens?</b>

09:46.190 --> 09:49.310
<b>That's not something I'd expect to hear from an assassin.</b>

09:50.310 --> 09:53.150
<b>I try not to play it up too much.</b>

09:53.530 --> 09:55.740
<b><i>He can't take much more of this either.</i></b>

09:55.740 --> 09:58.410
<b><i>But we still have our trump card.</i></b>

09:58.910 --> 10:00.570
<b><i>And that's how we'll win!</i></b>

10:01.410 --> 10:02.660
<b>Bro...</b>

10:03.370 --> 10:06.160
<b><i>If two Imperial Relic users battle one another,</i></b>

10:06.160 --> 10:07.960
<b><i>they cannot both survive.</i></b>

10:08.540 --> 10:10.920
<b>Since neither of us can use our Imperial Relic...</b>

10:10.920 --> 10:13.380
<b>...we'll settle this with our swords.</b>

10:21.890 --> 10:24.810
<b>I've taken the liberty of boosting my strength.{NANOMACHINES, SON}</b>

10:24.810 --> 10:26.890
<b>I'll need every advantage to win against you.</b>

10:26.890 --> 10:28.350
<b>Hey, Bro!</b>

10:28.350 --> 10:30.350
<b>Looks like he means business!</b>

10:30.350 --> 10:33.360
<b>I'm well aware this won't be easy.</b>

10:38.070 --> 10:39.030
<b>Here I come!</b>

10:50.250 --> 10:54.090
<b>How can they fight like that despite their injuries?</b>

11:13.770 --> 11:14.610
<b>Yes!</b>

11:19.950 --> 11:22.950
<b>Hidden Ability: Blades of Blood!</b>

11:24.950 --> 11:26.830
<b>So you had something up your sleeve!</b>

11:28.330 --> 11:29.330
<b>Bro!</b>

11:38.760 --> 11:40.590
<b>Are you all right, Bro?</b>

11:40.590 --> 11:43.010
<b>It'll take more than this to put me down.</b>

11:43.010 --> 11:44.430
<b>Don't worry.</b>

11:44.720 --> 11:47.510
<b><i>That attack was charged with my very life force...</i></b>

11:47.930 --> 11:49.810
<b><i>and yet, he withstood it.</i></b>

11:49.810 --> 11:51.060
<b><i>Incredible.</i></b>

11:55.940 --> 11:58.400
<b>If I'd moved even a second too late,</b>

11:58.400 --> 12:00.190
<b>I would've lost.</b>

12:01.030 --> 12:03.240
<b>The moment I saw him spewing blood,</b>

12:03.240 --> 12:05.740
<b>I realized that blood, too, is a liquid.{that's some mahoukadude tier thinking}</b>

12:07.240 --> 12:08.870
<b>Good thinking, Bro!</b>

12:09.660 --> 12:12.080
<b><i>I may have just been slowing him down...</i></b>

12:12.080 --> 12:15.420
<b><i>But to think we fought such powerful opponents and lived to tell the tale!{uh, i think one's still left}</i></b>

12:15.960 --> 12:17.090
<b><i>I'm so relieved.</i></b>

12:18.210 --> 12:19.300
<b>Bulat...</b>

12:21.590 --> 12:23.930
<b>I have one last thing to tell you.</b>

12:24.260 --> 12:29.470
<b>The real reason I decided to join Lady Esdeath's army.</b>

12:33.520 --> 12:37.770
<b>It'd be a dreadful shame for one 
of your repute to die in obscurity.</b>

12:37.770 --> 12:41.280
<b>I've been looking for a competent right-hand man.</b>

12:41.650 --> 12:43.240
<b>Join my army.</b>

12:46.490 --> 12:51.200
<b>I am a criminal. I cannot return to the army, 
whether I want to or not.</b>

12:52.200 --> 12:53.830
<b>Don't be so hesitant.</b>

12:53.830 --> 12:55.540
<b>Of course you can return.</b>

12:55.540 --> 12:57.880
<b>I want you to join my army,</b>

12:57.880 --> 13:01.340
<b>and I always get what I want.</b>

13:01.710 --> 13:03.880
<b>And what of the prime minister?</b>

13:03.880 --> 13:07.010
<b>It is my army that keeps him in power.</b>

13:07.010 --> 13:10.680
<b>He will be happy for you to swell our ranks.</b>

13:11.060 --> 13:13.310
<b>Come to my side, Liver.</b>

13:13.310 --> 13:15.440
<b>If there's anything else troubling you,</b>

13:15.440 --> 13:17.190
<b>I will make it all disappear.</b>

13:21.820 --> 13:24.900
<b>Simply put, I idolized her.</b>

13:25.530 --> 13:27.070
<b>That is all.</b>

13:28.240 --> 13:29.370
<b>Liver...</b>

13:29.990 --> 13:30.950
<b>Therefore...</b>

13:31.620 --> 13:35.000
<b>As someone who exists solely to serve Lady Esdeath,</b>

13:35.000 --> 13:37.620
<b>I will take your life!</b>

13:39.710 --> 13:40.790
<b>Bro!</b>

13:41.250 --> 13:44.880
<b>That vial before wasn't just a strength booster.</b>

13:45.720 --> 13:48.930
<b>It was also a deadly poison!</b>

13:49.850 --> 13:54.220
<b>You have no resistance to that poison. It will make short work of you.</b>

13:54.560 --> 13:55.890
<b>You cannot be saved.</b>

13:56.560 --> 13:57.690
<b>I'll see you...</b>

13:58.230 --> 14:00.270
<b>on the other side.</b>

14:08.280 --> 14:11.080
<b>I should have expected no less.</b>

14:11.580 --> 14:13.240
<b>We fell on each other's blades.{ok not literally but it sounds cool}</b>

14:15.540 --> 14:17.290
<b>We have to get you help!</b>

14:18.750 --> 14:20.000
<b>Tatsumi...</b>

14:20.750 --> 14:24.800
<b>The battle isn't over yet.</b>

14:27.840 --> 14:31.010
<b>Did you think the Blades of Blood were our trump card?</b>

14:31.550 --> 14:33.180
<b>I've got news for you.</b>

14:33.720 --> 14:36.680
<b>The real trump card... is me.</b>

14:36.680 --> 14:40.440
<b>Hidden Ability: Fierce Deity Rising.</b>

14:52.830 --> 14:58.040
<b>My Relic, Scream, isn't just for manipulating others.</b>

14:58.040 --> 15:02.880
<b>I can also use it on my own body.</b>

15:04.380 --> 15:08.380
<b>He boosted his own strength. 
So that's his hidden ability.{everyone 'roiding like fuck in this group}</b>

15:10.010 --> 15:14.600
<b>Ah, it's been some time since I last changed into this form.</b>

15:15.100 --> 15:16.560
<b><i>This is bad.</i></b>

15:16.560 --> 15:19.020
<b><i>He's already bested me once.</i></b>

15:19.730 --> 15:21.850
<b><i>What can I do on my own?</i></b>

15:22.480 --> 15:23.520
<b>Tatsumi...</b>

15:25.150 --> 15:28.610
<b>Tatsumi, I bequeath this unto you.</b>

15:29.900 --> 15:31.360
<b>That's...</b>

15:31.360 --> 15:33.820
<b>It's Incursio's key.</b>

15:34.410 --> 15:37.830
<b>Its rightful owner can use it to call forth the armor.</b>

15:37.830 --> 15:41.040
<b>Y-You want me to wield your Relic?</b>

15:42.750 --> 15:45.040
<b>That's impossible. Impossible!</b>

15:45.040 --> 15:47.590
<b>Incursio places immense strain upon its wielder.</b>

15:47.590 --> 15:51.300
<b>Any normal person who dons it dies instantly, right?</b>

15:51.300 --> 15:53.840
<b>I wouldn't push my luck if I were you.</b>

15:53.840 --> 15:56.930
<b>It'd be a shame if you died before our fight.</b>

15:56.930 --> 15:59.060
<b>Let's just battle it out, man to man.</b>

16:05.940 --> 16:10.280
<b>Don't let your enemy tell you what to think, dumbass!</b>

16:11.200 --> 16:14.320
<b>Think about your training 
and all you've been through!</b>

16:14.320 --> 16:17.490
<b>You're more than qualified to use that Relic, Tatsumi!</b>

16:18.700 --> 16:20.040
<b>Bro...</b>

16:21.710 --> 16:25.420
<b><i>I want to cut these two into pieces to avenge my friends.</i></b>

16:25.420 --> 16:28.090
<b><i>But it'll be no fun if I kill them right away.</i></b>

16:28.840 --> 16:32.010
<b>Don't forget that you also need 
to be compatible with the Relic!</b>

16:32.010 --> 16:34.010
<b>If you're not, you'll die instantly!</b>

16:34.890 --> 16:40.560
<b>Compatibility with a Relic is all about the feelings it inspires when you see it for the first time.</b>

16:41.270 --> 16:43.270
<b>That's what really matters.</b>

16:50.030 --> 16:51.900
<b>Wow! That was awesome!</b>

16:52.320 --> 16:54.150
<b>You can do it.</b>

16:54.660 --> 16:56.450
<b>Go, Tatsumi!</b>

16:58.410 --> 16:59.410
<b>Bro...</b>

17:07.170 --> 17:10.800
<b>That means a lot to me, coming from you.</b>

17:11.590 --> 17:14.590
<b>What kind of man would I be if I didn't live up to your expectations?</b>

17:16.510 --> 17:18.430
<b>So you're gonna try it on, huh?</b>

17:18.890 --> 17:19.930
<b>Well, then.</b>

17:19.930 --> 17:22.810
<b>I'll kill you before you can kill yourself!</b>

17:24.480 --> 17:26.140
<b>Shout it out, Tatsumi!</b>

17:26.140 --> 17:27.810
<b>Fill it with your raging spirit!</b>

17:31.940 --> 17:36.150
<b>Incursio!</b>

17:42.080 --> 17:43.370
<b><i>The armor...</i></b>

17:43.370 --> 17:47.000
<b><i>It's changing form to suit Tatsumi's body!</i></b>

17:49.920 --> 17:51.710
<b>What's with that armor?</b>

17:52.170 --> 17:54.800
<b>Don't tell me... Its raw form is still alive?</b>

17:55.800 --> 18:00.220
<b>Incursio was created by purifying 
raw materials taken from the Tyrant,</b>

18:00.220 --> 18:03.810
<b>a dragon-type Danger Beast with 
life force stronger than any other.</b>

18:04.640 --> 18:08.100
<b>That dragon could wander any land, 
whether burning desert or freezing tundra.</b>

18:08.100 --> 18:11.570
<b>It could survive any environment by evolving itself and adapting.</b>

18:12.110 --> 18:14.110
<b>Even after being formed into a Relic,</b>

18:14.110 --> 18:16.740
<b>the dragon's flesh is still alive!</b>

18:17.320 --> 18:19.450
<b>Wh-What an incredible Relic.{what a beautiful duwang}</b>

18:21.740 --> 18:22.950
<b>Tatsumi...</b>

18:23.450 --> 18:24.790
<b>I see.</b>

18:24.790 --> 18:26.460
<b>Your burning passion...</b>

18:26.460 --> 18:29.370
<b>has caused Incursio to evolve once more!</b>

18:32.880 --> 18:37.590
<b>You of Esdeath's army have committed 
multiple assassinations in Night Raid's name!</b>

18:37.970 --> 18:40.340
<b>It's time to accept your punishment!</b>

18:41.470 --> 18:43.890
<b>You're awfully cocky all of a sudden.</b>
