<b>I wonder if it's really okay to put Sheele in charge.</b>

03:17.380 --> 03:18.970
<b>I'm sure it will be.</b>

03:18.970 --> 03:21.180
<b>Those two will probably be just fine together.</b>

03:21.180 --> 03:22.890
<b>What makes you say that?</b>

03:22.890 --> 03:25.100
<b>Tatsumi seems to get along with older women.</b>

03:25.100 --> 03:25.970
<b>Me too!</b>

03:25.970 --> 03:28.350
<b>I call dibs on training him next!</b>

03:28.350 --> 03:30.140
<b>See? Even this is a skill.</b>

03:30.140 --> 03:32.690
<b>What the hell? That's so unfair!</b>

03:33.600 --> 03:35.270
<b>You could say that for an assassin,</b>

03:35.270 --> 03:36.690
<b>he's a real ladykiller.</b>

03:38.280 --> 03:39.150
<b>What'd you think?</b>

03:39.820 --> 03:41.150
<b>Pretty funny, huh? {wasn't that funny? busting a gut yet? think you'll die of laughter?}</b>

03:45.120 --> 03:47.120
<b>I guess not.{>seinfeld music resumes}</b>

03:47.830 --> 03:51.540
<b>So, for lunch, I'll be making mabo tofu 
over beef over rice. What do you think?{merged}</b>

03:51.960 --> 03:55.210
<b>Uh, wouldn't it be better to serve the tofu 
and beef over rice separately?</b>

03:55.210 --> 03:57.040
<b>Sounds great!</b>

03:57.040 --> 03:59.670
<b>And I was thinking of topping it off 
with some fried chicken.</b>

03:59.670 --> 04:00.420
<b>Thoughts?</b>

04:00.420 --> 04:03.180
<b>Isn't that a bit heavy? I don't think we need even more meat—</b>

04:03.180 --> 04:04.680
<b>Sounds great!</b>

04:04.680 --> 04:07.510
<b>Night Raid women sure are voracious.</b>

04:16.810 --> 04:19.440
<b>You did well to swim in that armor.</b>

04:22.400 --> 04:25.360
<b>It's so heavy... This is really hard.</b>

04:25.360 --> 04:29.700
<b>It's an important part of the 
assassin-training curriculum.</b>

04:29.700 --> 04:32.710
<b>Since I don't have a specific job at the hideout,</b>

04:32.710 --> 04:34.710
<b>I can concentrate on training you.</b>

04:34.710 --> 04:36.130
<b>Why don't you have a job?</b>

04:38.920 --> 04:40.380
<b>When I tried cooking...</b>

04:41.050 --> 04:44.050
<b>I burned the meat, and Akame lost her cool.</b>

04:43.630 --> 04:44.840
The meat...

04:43.630 --> 04:44.840
The meat...

04:44.050 --> 04:44.840
<b>The meat...</b>

04:45.800 --> 04:50.310
<b>When I tried cleaning, I only made a bigger mess, 
which meant more work for Bulat.</b>

04:51.850 --> 04:53.060
<b>Don't worry about it!</b>

04:54.140 --> 04:58.520
<b>When I tried shopping, I mistook sugar for salt, 
and Leone laughed at me.</b>

04:59.730 --> 05:01.900
<b>You bought so much!</b>

05:02.780 --> 05:04.070
<b>And when I tried doing laundry...</b>

05:05.610 --> 05:09.200
<b>I accidentally put Mine in with the wash.</b>

05:09.200 --> 05:10.990
<b>Uh, I wouldn't worry about that last one.</b>

05:10.990 --> 05:12.700
<b><i>In fact, good job.</i></b>

05:13.080 --> 05:14.620
<b>By the way, Sheele...</b>

05:15.500 --> 05:19.040
<b>You weren't with the others when I met them at the end of the first mission, were you?</b>

05:20.550 --> 05:21.750
<b>Hmm...</b>

05:21.750 --> 05:25.260
<b>I feel like there was a reason for that...</b>

05:25.260 --> 05:26.970
<b>But I can't remember.</b>

05:27.390 --> 05:28.640
<b>Oh.</b>

05:28.640 --> 05:30.180
<b>I'm sorry for being so—</b>

05:31.350 --> 05:32.850
<b>My glasses, my glasses...</b>

05:37.650 --> 05:40.060
<b>Why are you in this line of work, Sheele?</b>

05:43.530 --> 05:45.530
<b>If I were to start from the beginning...</b>

05:46.700 --> 05:49.820
<b>I grew up in the capital's industrial district.</b>

05:56.580 --> 06:00.080
<b>I've been clumsy and disaster-prone ever since I was a child.</b>

06:00.080 --> 06:03.880
<b>I lived life without ever 
taking pride in anything.</b>

06:04.960 --> 06:08.340
<b>"She probably has a screw loose somewhere."</b>

06:08.340 --> 06:11.180
<b>Or so they used to say about me.</b>

06:15.430 --> 06:16.390
<b>However...</b>

06:19.350 --> 06:23.690
<b>There was one girl who was kind to me.</b>

06:24.610 --> 06:26.860
<b>She never made fun of me,</b>

06:26.860 --> 06:30.780
<b>no matter what mistakes I made.</b>

06:30.780 --> 06:35.660
<b>The time I spent with her was 
the only time I was truly happy.</b>

06:36.500 --> 06:37.960
<b>Until that day...</b>

06:40.710 --> 06:43.380
<b>I was with her, as usual, at her house.</b>

06:44.710 --> 06:46.710
<b>A man appeared at the door—</b>

06:47.970 --> 06:50.380
<b>her former boyfriend.</b>

06:50.380 --> 06:52.800
<b>He resented her for leaving him,</b>

06:52.930 --> 06:54.310
<b>and things got violent.</b>

06:54.760 --> 06:58.060
<b>Eventually, he grabbed her neck and started to strangle her.</b>

06:58.060 --> 07:01.020
<b>He was high on drugs at the time.</b>

07:01.020 --> 07:04.150
<b>I thought to myself, "I have to save her."</b>

07:12.200 --> 07:14.410
<b>I felt strangely calm.</b>

07:15.200 --> 07:17.540
<b>The man died immediately.</b>

07:18.960 --> 07:21.750
<b>My friend was trembling 
from what had just happened,</b>

07:22.540 --> 07:25.920
<b>but in contrast, my mind was clear.</b>

07:27.760 --> 07:31.970
<b>In the end, it was ruled that I acted in self-defense.</b>

07:32.510 --> 07:35.970
<b>But I never saw my friend again.</b>

07:37.060 --> 07:38.390
<b>And then...</b>

07:40.310 --> 07:44.400
<b>A few days later, the man's friends came to avenge his death.</b>

07:44.400 --> 07:48.900
<b>They told me that they'd already killed my parents, and that I was next.</b>

07:48.900 --> 07:50.860
<b>Although I was being threatened,</b>

07:51.610 --> 07:54.320
<b>again, I felt strangely calm.</b>

08:02.960 --> 08:07.090
<b>I killed the men, one after another, 
with the knife I kept for protection.</b>

08:24.650 --> 08:27.980
<b>That was when I realized...</b>

08:29.230 --> 08:31.530
<b>that the screw I had loose in my mind...</b>

08:31.530 --> 08:33.280
<b>made me a talented killer.</b>

08:34.030 --> 08:36.620
<b>I could help rid society of its garbage.</b>

08:36.620 --> 08:39.700
<b>I had finally found a way I could be useful.</b>

08:40.830 --> 08:45.960
<b>When the Revolutionary Army recruited me, 
I was a freelance assassin in the capital.</b>

08:47.080 --> 08:49.590
<b><i>Everyone's been through so much.</i></b>

08:50.500 --> 08:52.970
<b>I wonder if I'm really up to this.</b>

08:52.970 --> 08:54.720
<b>Don't worry.</b>

08:58.640 --> 09:02.310
<b>You're much better at cooking than me.</b>

09:02.310 --> 09:03.850
<b><i>That's what this was about?</i></b>

09:04.390 --> 09:05.690
<b>Nice going, Tatsumi!</b>

09:11.030 --> 09:13.030
<b><i>I wonder if I'm really up to this.</i></b>

09:13.900 --> 09:16.740
<b>Tatsumi, your wounds have pretty much healed, right?</b>

09:16.740 --> 09:19.280
<b>This is the Imperial Relic we took from Zank.</b>

09:19.870 --> 09:20.950
<b>Try it on.</b>

09:21.450 --> 09:23.120
<b>Can I?</b>

09:23.120 --> 09:24.160
<b>Don't you guys want to?</b>

09:24.160 --> 09:26.170
<b>Each person can only wield one Relic.</b>

09:26.170 --> 09:29.750
<b>Operating them takes a lot of 
mental and physical strength.</b>

09:30.420 --> 09:32.050
<b><i>It's kinda uncool,</i></b>

09:32.590 --> 09:35.970
<b><i>but this eye has incredible abilities!</i></b>

09:37.640 --> 09:39.890
<b>It wasn't in any of the documents,</b>

09:39.890 --> 09:41.220
<b>so we don't know a lot about it.</b>

09:41.220 --> 09:43.640
<b>It has the power to read minds, right?</b>

09:43.640 --> 09:45.310
<b>Try reading mine.</b>

09:46.640 --> 09:47.230
<b>You...</b>

09:54.320 --> 09:56.400
<b>You want to eat meat tonight!</b>

09:56.990 --> 09:57.860
<b>It's perfect!</b>

09:57.860 --> 09:58.820
<b>Nah.</b>

09:58.820 --> 10:00.910
<b>It hasn't even activated yet.</b>

10:00.910 --> 10:03.790
<b>I don't want you peeking inside my mind.</b>

10:03.790 --> 10:06.870
<b>If it's got five perception abilities, 
why not test another?</b>

10:07.830 --> 10:08.830
<b>Never happy, are you?</b>

10:09.250 --> 10:10.000
<b>All right, then.</b>

10:12.090 --> 10:15.090
<b>The final, unknown ability...</b>

10:15.090 --> 10:16.590
<b>Activate!</b>

10:22.640 --> 10:24.060
<b>Well?</b>

10:25.560 --> 10:27.140
<b>What's the matter?</b>

10:27.140 --> 10:29.560
<b><i>What an incredible power!</i></b>

10:27.390 --> 10:29.020
<b>He's acting weird.</b>

10:29.560 --> 10:30.810
<b><i>Imperial Relics are amazing!</i></b>

10:33.020 --> 10:34.980
<b>This is bad. It's rejecting him!</b>

10:34.980 --> 10:36.030
<b>Take it off at once.</b>

10:36.780 --> 10:38.360
<b>I suddenly lost all my strength.</b>

10:38.360 --> 10:39.950
<b>You weren't compatible.</b>

10:39.950 --> 10:41.490
<b>I guess you just didn't suit each other.</b>

10:41.490 --> 10:44.830
<b>I bet you were worried about how lame you looked.</b>

10:44.830 --> 10:49.250
<b>They say first impressions count when it comes to Relics.</b>

10:49.870 --> 10:52.500
<b>We'll send it to the 
Revolutionary Army's headquarters.</b>

10:52.500 --> 10:55.170
<b>They'll analyze how best 
we can use it to our advantage.</b>

10:55.920 --> 10:58.420
<b>Although we are primarily a team of assassins,</b>

10:58.420 --> 11:01.550
<b>collecting the Imperial Relics is an important sub-mission.</b>

11:01.550 --> 11:05.140
<b>We take Relics from those 
who wield them, such as Zank.</b>

11:05.140 --> 11:07.730
<b>Those we can't take, we destroy.</b>

11:07.730 --> 11:10.230
<b>So basically, the more Imperial Relics we get,</b>

11:10.230 --> 11:12.060
<b>the stronger the Revolutionary Army?</b>

11:12.060 --> 11:13.560
<b>Exactly.</b>

11:13.560 --> 11:16.110
<b>Read this book. It covers all the Relics we know of.</b>

11:18.360 --> 11:19.860
<b>Wow.</b>

11:19.860 --> 11:21.450
<b>There are so many.</b>

11:21.450 --> 11:22.570
<b>And this is just some of them?</b>

11:23.120 --> 11:26.370
<b>Learn as much as you can, 
if only about the ones in there.</b>

11:26.740 --> 11:29.870
<b>Speaking of that, which is 
the strongest Imperial Relic?</b>

11:29.870 --> 11:32.540
<b>That would depend on compatibility and how it was used.</b>

11:32.540 --> 11:34.750
<b>But if I had to choose one...</b>

11:36.170 --> 11:38.300
<b>I'd say the Relic that controls ice.</b>

11:38.920 --> 11:40.840
<b>I believe it to be the strongest.</b>

11:40.840 --> 11:44.300
<b>Fortunately, its user isn't in the capital.</b>

11:44.300 --> 11:46.430
<b>They're busy subjugating the northern race.</b>

11:46.890 --> 11:48.810
<b>The northern race?</b>

11:48.810 --> 11:50.890
<b>Have you heard of the hero Numa Seika?</b>

11:52.020 --> 11:54.270
<b>He is their prince.</b>

11:54.270 --> 11:56.860
<b>Spear in hand, he has yet to taste defeat.</b>

11:56.860 --> 12:01.650
<b>A fierce, brilliant strategist in whom the northern race has invested their faith.</b>

12:01.650 --> 12:03.410
<b>As you might imagine, 
he's a threat to the empire.</b>

12:04.700 --> 12:08.700
<b>He has gathered a powerful army based in their most fortified city,</b>

12:08.700 --> 12:11.250
<b>where they are rallying their forces to invade the capital.</b>

12:11.960 --> 12:13.670
<b>As a pre-emptive measure,</b>

12:13.670 --> 12:18.250
<b>the empire has struck out to invade the North.</b>

12:19.590 --> 12:21.130
<b>There's nothing to worry about.</b>

12:22.010 --> 12:26.220
<b>It'll take them at least a year to conquer the North, 
even with that woman leading the charge.</b>

12:26.220 --> 12:27.100
<b>That's true.</b>

12:30.020 --> 12:31.930
<b>The more the merrier, I say!</b>

12:31.930 --> 12:33.690
<b>Let's add their Relics to our collection!</b>

12:33.690 --> 12:35.810
<b>You're rather enthusiastic all of a sudden.</b>

12:35.810 --> 12:37.230
<b>Where'd that come from?</b>

12:37.230 --> 12:40.070
<b>Well, there are still many unknown Relics out there, right?</b>

12:40.440 --> 12:42.070
<b>When I thought of that, 
it suddenly struck me.</b>

12:42.530 --> 12:44.280
<b>Based on what I've seen,</b>

12:44.660 --> 12:45.910
<b>maybe—</b>

12:45.910 --> 12:47.240
<b>just maybe—</b>

12:47.660 --> 12:50.700
<b>there might be a Relic out there that can resurrect the dead! {this guy's a baka}</b>

12:50.700 --> 12:51.660
<b>Right?</b>

12:52.960 --> 12:55.830
<b>If I find it, I can bring Sayo and Ieyasu back!</b>

12:55.830 --> 12:57.250
<b>So I'll collect as many Imperial—</b>

12:57.250 --> 12:58.210
<b>You can't.</b>

12:59.250 --> 13:00.630
<b>Bro?</b>

13:00.630 --> 13:03.720
<b>Not even Imperial Relics can bring back the dead.</b>

13:04.800 --> 13:06.720
<b>You only get one life.{#YOLO}</b>

13:07.970 --> 13:09.720
<b>You can't say that for sure!</b>

13:09.720 --> 13:11.270
<b>Not until you try!</b>

13:11.270 --> 13:12.850
<b>The current emperor is perfect evidence.</b>

13:13.480 --> 13:16.650
<b>If such a Relic existed, the first emperor would still be on the throne.</b>

13:16.650 --> 13:20.230
<b>The whole reason he created them was 
because he knew he'd die one day, right?</b>

13:23.650 --> 13:25.150
<b>Abandon your fantasies.</b>

13:25.150 --> 13:28.570
<b>If you do not, that weakness in your heart 
will be used against you.</b>

13:29.410 --> 13:31.950
<b>And you will die.</b>

13:50.390 --> 13:51.510
<b>Tatsumi?</b>

13:51.510 --> 13:52.890
<b>You're still awake?</b>

13:53.930 --> 13:55.640
<b>For one brief moment...</b>

13:55.640 --> 13:58.270
<b>I thought maybe I could bring them back, 
and it made me happy.</b>

13:58.770 --> 14:02.320
<b>As long as the slightest 
possibility existed, it gave me hope.</b>

14:05.530 --> 14:09.160
<b>But now I guess it really is goodbye.</b>

14:10.070 --> 14:11.990
<b>I thought I'd already given up,</b>

14:13.740 --> 14:14.790
<b>but...</b>

14:17.370 --> 14:18.960
<b>Tatsumi...</b>

14:30.220 --> 14:33.180
<b>Cry as much as you need to.</b>

14:33.180 --> 14:35.390
<b>I won't tell the others.</b>

14:38.440 --> 14:41.650
<b>Should you really be so easy on your subordinate?</b>

14:41.650 --> 14:43.110
<b>Who can say?</b>

14:43.110 --> 14:44.980
<b>I think it's fine.</b>

14:44.980 --> 14:45.900
<b>Probably.</b>

14:47.110 --> 14:48.400
<b>That's just like you, Sheele.</b>

14:50.990 --> 14:53.160
<b>Thanks, Sheele.</b>

14:57.250 --> 14:59.500
<b><i>I should be thanking you, Tatsumi.</i></b>

15:01.040 --> 15:05.710
<b><i>You've shown me another way I can be useful.</i></b>

15:25.650 --> 15:28.610
<b>The northerners were defeated in an instant.</b>

15:28.610 --> 15:30.200
<b>Another magnificent victory, General Esdeath.</b>

15:31.610 --> 15:33.870
<b>And the North called this dog their hero.</b>

15:33.870 --> 15:35.030
<b>How boring.</b>

15:35.030 --> 15:35.870
<b>Die.</b>

15:38.950 --> 15:43.330
<b>Is there no opponent powerful enough to satisfy me?</b>

15:49.090 --> 15:51.380
<b>The slums are pretty lively.</b>

15:51.380 --> 15:53.470
<b>That's 'cos you can't keep the poor down.</b>

15:53.470 --> 15:56.390
<b>Those who are born into terrible poverty come out stronger for it.</b>

15:56.390 --> 15:57.510
<b>Hi, Leone!</b>

15:57.510 --> 15:59.390
<b>I'd love another of your shoulder massages!</b>

15:59.930 --> 16:01.640
<b>How about a drink tonight, Leone?</b>

16:01.640 --> 16:04.810
<b>Leone! Come play with me!</b>

16:04.810 --> 16:07.230
<b>You're really popular here.</b>

16:07.230 --> 16:10.360
<b>Well, I was born and raised here.</b>

16:10.360 --> 16:13.200
<b>I also made a name for myself around here as a masseuse—</b>

16:13.200 --> 16:14.490
<b>There she is! It's Leone!</b>

16:14.490 --> 16:16.830
<b>I'm gonna wring that tab out of you!</b>

16:16.240 --> 16:17.120
<b>Shoot!</b>

16:16.830 --> 16:18.950
<b>Time to pay off your gambling debts!</b>

16:18.040 --> 16:18.950
<b>Ah, hey!</b>

16:18.950 --> 16:22.410
<b>Pay back the money you scammed from my brother!</b>

16:22.410 --> 16:24.790
<b>What do you think? Isn't this place fun?</b>

16:24.790 --> 16:28.380
<b>What's so fun about running for your life?!</b>

16:30.170 --> 16:31.090
<b>I have news to report.</b>

16:31.670 --> 16:37.470
<b>General Nakakido and General Hemi 
have defected to the Revolutionary Army.</b>

16:37.470 --> 16:39.560
<b>General Nakakido is a brilliant strategist.</b>

16:39.560 --> 16:43.350
<b>The Revolutionary Army is gaining power at an alarming rate.</b>

16:43.350 --> 16:45.440
<b>If we don't put a stop to this soon, the empire...</b>

16:45.440 --> 16:46.940
<b>Calm yourselves!</b>

16:47.480 --> 16:49.980
<b>They remain encamped in the south.</b>

16:49.980 --> 16:52.030
<b>We can deal with them at any time!</b>

16:52.030 --> 16:56.910
<b>Gathering together as they have 
simply makes them easier to eliminate!</b>

16:57.410 --> 16:59.410
<b>Isn't that right, Prime Minister?</b>

17:00.830 --> 17:02.450
<b>You are wise as always, my lord.</b>

17:02.450 --> 17:04.920
<b>Once again, you are the voice of reason.</b>

17:04.920 --> 17:06.630
<b>Right now...{#hamuhamumogumogu}</b>

17:12.170 --> 17:14.930
<b>we must concentrate on a more immediate threat.</b>

17:15.260 --> 17:17.260
<b>Ogre of the imperial police,</b>

<b>my own relative Iokal,</b>

<b>and even Zank the Executioner</b>

<b>were struck down by Night Raid, 
who made off with one of our Relics.</b>

17:24.310 --> 17:27.650
<b>They are assailing us left and right!</b>

17:27.650 --> 17:31.440
<b>The stress is doing terrible things to my weight!</b>

17:34.860 --> 17:37.160
<b>We will call for General Esdeath to return.</b>

17:39.660 --> 17:43.450
<b>B-But Commander-in-Chief Budo is in charge of the capital!</b>

17:43.450 --> 17:48.080
<b>Tasking the commander-in-chief with mere pest control would be an insult.</b>

17:48.080 --> 17:49.540
<b>Esdeath, huh?</b>

17:51.000 --> 17:53.630
<b>She is a strategist rivaling the 
commander-in-chief in ability.</b>

17:53.630 --> 17:54.800
<b>We are in safe hands.</b>

17:54.800 --> 18:00.100
<b>With her dominion over ice, she buried over four hundred thousand northerners alive.</b>

18:00.930 --> 18:03.060
<b>It's no longer a question of life or death.</b>

18:03.060 --> 18:07.100
<b>She will hunt down and 
exterminate them without fail!</b>

18:14.360 --> 18:16.650
<b>We must have lost them by now.</b>

18:16.650 --> 18:18.240
<b>Right, Leo—</b>

18:18.990 --> 18:20.990
<b>Hey... Huh?</b>

18:21.830 --> 18:23.080
<b>Leone?</b>

18:24.490 --> 18:26.040
<b><i>This is bad! We've been separated!</i></b>

18:26.960 --> 18:29.000
<b><i>And I have no idea where I am!</i></b>

18:31.290 --> 18:34.760
<b>What's this? My Justice Radar's picking up something!{merged}</b>

18:35.130 --> 18:36.300
<b>You, over there!</b>

18:38.300 --> 18:40.180
<b>Is there something I can help you with?</b>

18:41.180 --> 18:42.140
<b>That uniform...</b>

18:42.680 --> 18:44.470
<b>I'm Seryu, from the imperial police—</b>

18:44.470 --> 18:45.520
<b>a soldier of justice!</b>

18:45.520 --> 18:46.980
<b><i>Imperial police...</i></b>

18:52.940 --> 18:55.400
<b>What's up, Coro? Hungry?</b>

18:55.400 --> 18:57.110
<b>Hang in there, okay?</b>

18:57.110 --> 18:59.400
<b>Um, what's that?</b>

19:00.410 --> 19:02.370
<b>The Imperial Relic Hecatoncheir.</b>

19:02.370 --> 19:03.620
<b>But don't worry.</b>

19:03.620 --> 19:05.240
<b>He only harms evildoers.</b>

19:06.700 --> 19:08.910
<b><i>He was in that book.</i></b>

19:09.290 --> 19:11.580
<b>Anyway, are you in need of assistance?</b>

19:11.580 --> 19:15.090
<b>Uh, well... I kinda lost my way.</b>

19:15.090 --> 19:17.760
<b>But I know the name of the area I was in earlier.</b>

19:17.760 --> 19:19.130
<b>What a predicament!</b>

19:19.130 --> 19:20.800
<b>I'll take you there on my patrol.</b>

19:21.930 --> 19:22.800
<b>This way!</b>

19:22.800 --> 19:24.430
<b>Don't get separated from me, okay?</b>

19:29.180 --> 19:33.230
<b>Do all imperial police have creatures like him?</b>

19:33.230 --> 19:33.860
<b>Nope.</b>

19:34.730 --> 19:37.150
<b>I'm the only one with this Relic.</b>

19:37.150 --> 19:37.690
<b>If Coro—</b>

19:38.900 --> 19:41.450
<b>that's the name I gave him—</b>

19:41.450 --> 19:45.830
<b>doesn't like his user, he won't even move.</b>

19:47.040 --> 19:51.420
<b>No one higher up was compatible with Coro.</b>

19:51.420 --> 19:54.840
<b>So they tested the lower ranks, too.</b>

19:54.840 --> 19:59.720
<b>That was when he reacted to my passion for justice.</b>

20:00.340 --> 20:03.340
<b>And now, he's my beloved partner.</b>

20:03.890 --> 20:04.930
<b>Right, Coro?</b>

20:07.220 --> 20:09.350
<b>O-Oh.</b>

20:12.310 --> 20:15.770
<b>Um, I believe this is the area you mentioned earlier.</b>

20:16.610 --> 20:17.730
<b>Thank you very much.</b>

20:18.150 --> 20:19.150
<b>Don't mention it!</b>

20:19.150 --> 20:21.700
<b>If you encounter any evil, just let me know!</b>

20:21.700 --> 20:23.610
<b>The two of us will wipe it out for good!</b>

20:24.660 --> 20:26.580
<b>That's good to hear.</b>

20:26.990 --> 20:28.120
<b>Let's go, Coro.</b>

20:28.120 --> 20:29.410
<b>I bet you're hungry.</b>

20:29.410 --> 20:31.710
<b>How does five death-row inmates sound?</b>

20:40.170 --> 20:42.800
<b><i>An imperial police officer with a Relic of her own, huh?</i></b>

20:42.800 --> 20:44.130
<b><i>Sounds like trouble.</i></b>

20:44.890 --> 20:47.100
<b><i>I should report this to the boss.</i></b>

20:47.430 --> 20:49.680
<b><i>Helping people is important.</i></b>

20:49.680 --> 20:52.020
<b><i>But I have to hurry and find Night Raid!</i></b>

20:53.980 --> 20:55.310
<b><i>Captain Ogre...</i></b>

<b>Nice form, Seryu.</b>

<b>You've grown stronger, haven't you?</b>

21:09.370 --> 21:11.580
<b>That Imperial Relic chose me of all people for a reason!</b>

21:12.120 --> 21:14.920
<b>I must become stronger!</b>

21:16.920 --> 21:19.290
<b>Justice will never yield to evil!</b>

21:19.290 --> 21:21.760
<b>That's what my father said 
before he died in the line of duty!</b>

21:22.090 --> 21:23.090
<b>Oh?</b>

21:23.630 --> 21:26.090
<b>If your desire to grow stronger is that great,</b>

21:26.090 --> 21:28.260
<b>I can give you the trump card you need.</b>

21:28.260 --> 21:29.260
<b>Really?</b>

21:29.260 --> 21:32.810
<b>I know a doctor who's been wanting to try out some new technology.</b>

21:33.350 --> 21:36.140
<b>It's an incredibly painful procedure, though.</b>

21:36.480 --> 21:38.100
<b>That doesn't matter!</b>

21:38.100 --> 21:41.150
<b>I'll sacrifice anything to bring down evil!</b>

21:41.820 --> 21:45.360
