<b>Now, then. Let us begin this battle between Relic-wielders.</b>

00:06.400 --> 00:08.020
<b>I wonder how many will die?</b>

00:13.030 --> 00:17.330
<b>The strain of controlling eight
dead bodies should dull her reactions.</b>

00:17.330 --> 00:19.200
<b>I won't waste this opportunity!</b>

00:39.140 --> 00:40.560
<b>Let him rest in peace!</b>

00:41.060 --> 00:42.810
<b>Wasn't he an old friend of yours?</b>

00:43.390 --> 00:45.690
<b>What do you mean, Sis?</b>

00:48.190 --> 00:52.740
<b>I want to always be with him
<i>because</i> he's my friend.</b>

00:53.320 --> 00:56.280
<b>I'll add you to my collection as well, Sis.</b>

00:56.740 --> 01:00.540
<b>That way, we can be together again.</b>

01:01.330 --> 01:02.450
<b>Shut up!</b>

01:04.370 --> 01:05.830
<b>Too bad.</b>

01:08.080 --> 01:09.880
<b>Magma Drive!</b>

01:12.800 --> 01:15.470
<b><i>That Imperial Relic has a long-ranged attack?</i></b>

01:18.720 --> 01:20.050
<b>Don't rush in alone!</b>

01:20.430 --> 01:21.970
<b>This isn't like you, Akame!</b>

01:23.850 --> 01:24.810
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

01:27.190 --> 01:31.940
<b>It doesn't look like these guys
are going down without a fight.</b>

03:08.410 --> 03:11.540
<b>You betrayed us and threw

03:11.540 --> 03:13.880
<b>Get them, Destaghoul!</b>

03:28.680 --> 03:31.730
<b>So this is what an ultra-class
Danger Beast can do.</b>

03:31.730 --> 03:33.230
<b>This is crazy!</b>

03:35.230 --> 03:37.190
<b>The very landscape's changed.</b>

03:37.440 --> 03:38.480
<b>However,</b>

<b>you don't have your reputation for nothing, Night Raid.</b>

03:43.200 --> 03:44.910
<b>It didn't even touch you.</b>

03:48.200 --> 03:50.500
<b>The battle's begun, huh?</b>

03:50.960 --> 03:54.460
<b><i>I've got to do my part too.</i></b>

<b><i>If I don't act soon, Su might take her from me.</i></b>

04:06.720 --> 04:09.020
<b>What destructive power.</b>

04:09.020 --> 04:11.680
<b>All right. We'll stop him together!</b>

04:11.680 --> 04:15.150
<b>I would not advise that order, Najenda.</b>

04:15.150 --> 04:17.650
<b>He is certainly powerful.</b>

04:18.190 --> 04:19.070
<b>However...</b>

04:21.650 --> 04:23.740
<b>I can deal with him myself.</b>

04:23.740 --> 04:25.280
<b>Have everyone else go after the others.</b>

04:27.280 --> 04:28.910
<b>That's my Relic for you.</b>

04:30.410 --> 04:32.080
<b>If I can just bring down Kurome...</b>

04:32.410 --> 04:34.170
<b>This time, I won't miss!</b>

04:42.380 --> 04:43.720
<b>A gunslinger, huh?</b>

04:43.720 --> 04:44.720
<b>Bring it!</b>

04:49.890 --> 04:52.390
<b><i>So this is another Danger Beast carcass.</i></b>

04:52.390 --> 04:54.440
<b><i>It's a type I've never seen before.</i></b>

05:02.190 --> 05:03.400
<b><i>Another enemy?</i></b>

<b>Unskilled, skilled, skilled...{idk}</b>

05:12.700 --> 05:15.410
<b><i>If not for the armor, he would've gotten me.</i></b>

05:15.410 --> 05:17.080
<b><i>What the hell is that thing?</i></b>

05:17.080 --> 05:19.130
<b>I failed. Failed.{oh, it's migi}</b>

05:20.920 --> 05:22.670
<b><i>That fire is dangerous.</i></b>

05:23.050 --> 05:23.880
<b>Eliminate.</b>

05:23.880 --> 05:26.300
<b>Straight from the front?</b>

<b><i>Murasame won't work on a corpse puppet!</i></b>

<b>Akame!</b>

05:54.370 --> 05:58.000
<b>You're in for it now, old man.</b>

06:00.960 --> 06:02.840
<b>I can see through your moves, clear as...</b>

06:04.340 --> 06:05.210
<b>mud!</b>

06:06.840 --> 06:09.840
<b><i>My kinetic perception can't keep up!</i></b>

06:09.840 --> 06:11.720
<b><i>He isn't even using an Imperial Relic!</i></b>

06:11.720 --> 06:13.310
<b><i>This guy...</i></b>

06:13.680 --> 06:16.770
<b>Wow, it's a battle royal!</b>

06:16.770 --> 06:17.810
<b>How fun!</b>

06:17.810 --> 06:19.060
<b>Kurome...</b>

06:19.060 --> 06:22.690
<b>See? Aren't my toys great?</b>

06:23.360 --> 06:26.780
<b>Doya's an assassin from the northern race.</b>

06:27.400 --> 06:31.070
<b>She's super-confident. You can tell from the expression on her face.</b>

06:31.490 --> 06:37.080
<b>Woll was a famous bodyguard, but he was
protecting one of my targets, so I killed him.</b>

06:37.500 --> 06:41.580
<b>Apeman's a real muscle-brain, but he's easy to use, so he's one of my favorites.</b>

06:42.080 --> 06:45.210
<b>Hentarr was a survivor of a savage tribe.</b>

06:45.210 --> 06:49.590
<b>His moves are tricky, so I had a tough time killing him. He's my pride and joy.</b>

06:49.930 --> 06:52.930
<b>Rokgough was an imperial general.</b>

06:52.930 --> 06:55.850
<b>He tried to defect to the Revolutionary Army, 
so I assassinated him.</b>

06:56.850 --> 07:00.140
<b>And I found Destaghoul while he was hibernating.</b>

07:00.140 --> 07:01.350
<b>Lucky catch, huh?</b>

07:01.770 --> 07:02.440
<b>Lastly...</b>

07:03.110 --> 07:06.030
<b>My childhood friend, Natala!</b>

07:06.480 --> 07:09.700
<b>He does a great job of defending me 
while I'm using Yatsufusa.</b>

07:10.150 --> 07:15.030
<b>Actually, I have one more, 
but you'll have to wait a bit for their debut.</b>

07:15.030 --> 07:18.830
<b><i>There's another one we haven't even seen yet?</i></b>

07:20.960 --> 07:22.420
<b><i>Damn it!</i></b>

07:24.750 --> 07:25.750
<b><i>What?</i></b>

07:25.750 --> 07:28.090
<b>It's no use. They're puppets.</b>

07:28.550 --> 07:31.260
<b>Not even skewering their hearts will stop them.</b>

07:31.550 --> 07:33.760
<b>As long as I'm still standing, anyway.</b>

07:39.770 --> 07:42.650
<b>You're certainly strong, old man.</b>

07:42.650 --> 07:43.730
<b>But...</b>

07:45.770 --> 07:47.900
<b>I've figured out your game!</b>

07:47.900 --> 07:50.570
<b>Using the same move over
and over won't work on me!</b>

07:50.570 --> 07:52.200
<b>Don't let go, Leone!</b>

07:55.160 --> 07:56.410
<b>General Rokgough...</b>

07:57.870 --> 07:59.330
<b>As a former colleague,</b>

07:59.330 --> 08:03.420
<b>I will free you from this curse as quickly as possible.</b>

08:03.420 --> 08:06.920
<b>I-It's been a while since I've seen you fight.</b>

08:07.550 --> 08:09.340
<b>All right, my turn!</b>

08:17.300 --> 08:21.020
<b>Letting me out of your sight is a bad idea.</b>

08:21.680 --> 08:24.350
<b>I won't hesitate to take
advantage of the situation.</b>

08:24.730 --> 08:26.770
<b>That does it.</b>

08:26.770 --> 08:28.190
<b>You...</b>

08:28.650 --> 08:31.530
<b>Taking advantage of the situation?</b>

08:32.900 --> 08:35.530
<b>Two can play at that game.</b>

08:40.910 --> 08:44.170
<b>Wow! Stopping your own bleeding is rather impressive!</b>

08:47.790 --> 08:52.260
<b>I'll show you what happens when you enrage a lion!</b>

08:54.720 --> 08:56.340
<b>Don't rush in, Leone!</b>

08:57.140 --> 08:59.010
<b>Kurome has guards.</b>

08:59.010 --> 09:01.350
<b>First, support Akame.</b>

09:01.720 --> 09:04.140
<b>Then go after Kurome together.</b>

09:04.440 --> 09:06.600
<b>We'll settle this, general to general.</b>

09:06.600 --> 09:09.980
<b>He doesn't even have a Relic of his own. I'll be fine.</b>

09:10.650 --> 09:12.190
<b>Understood.</b>

09:13.360 --> 09:15.030
<b><i>Just you wait.</i></b>

09:15.030 --> 09:16.820
<b><i>I'll be back for you.</i></b>

09:17.700 --> 09:21.740
<b>I'm starting to think I could
do with you in my collection.{end of part a}</b>

09:27.290 --> 09:31.170
<b>We should have caught up to
them by now. Something's off.</b>

09:31.630 --> 09:34.050
<b>It is indeed strange.</b>

09:34.050 --> 09:37.380
<b>Could this be a setup? Perhaps they were aiming for Kurome's party all along.</b>

09:43.350 --> 09:46.640
<b>So this territory is overrun by bandits.</b>

09:46.640 --> 09:48.440
<b>I doubt this was a coincidence.</b>

09:48.440 --> 09:50.900
<b>They're here, just as we were told!</b>

09:50.900 --> 09:52.150
<b>It's General Esdeath.</b>

09:52.150 --> 09:53.360
<b>She's irresistible!</b>

09:53.360 --> 09:56.530
<b>They must be in league with Night Raid.{or "Night Raid's gurus" as that one cr tl would put it}</b>

09:56.530 --> 09:58.610
<b>Seryu, Run...</b>

09:59.120 --> 10:00.870
<b>We will trample them underfoot.</b>

10:00.870 --> 10:03.870
<b>Leave a few alive, but break all their bones.</b>

10:05.250 --> 10:06.910
<b>I have some questions for them.</b>

10:10.670 --> 10:12.500
<b><i>I can't jump in carelessly.</i></b>

10:12.500 --> 10:13.300
<b><i>However...</i></b>

10:17.680 --> 10:21.470
<b><i>She's circling us, looking for a chance to strike.</i></b>

10:21.470 --> 10:24.180
<b><i>I'll give her the opening she wants!</i></b>

10:28.600 --> 10:29.690
<b><i>I can do it!</i></b>

10:35.730 --> 10:37.740
<b><i>He has armor plates on his wrists!</i></b>

10:37.740 --> 10:39.030
<b><i>Anti-Murasame equipment.</i></b>

10:41.950 --> 10:43.950
<b>What an incredible flip!</b>

10:49.540 --> 10:53.170
<b>May I ask you one thing?</b>

10:53.670 --> 10:57.970
<b>Akame, why did you join the Revolutionary Army?</b>

10:58.670 --> 11:02.220
<b>I would have been glad to have you as my ally.</b>

11:15.480 --> 11:19.860
<b>Because I knew in my heart that this was the right path.</b>

11:19.860 --> 11:22.110
<b>I merely chose to walk the path I believed in.</b>

11:23.320 --> 11:25.490
<b>A straightforward explanation.</b>

11:25.490 --> 11:26.740
<b>Thank you.</b>

11:27.490 --> 11:28.080
<b>However...</b>

11:28.080 --> 11:33.330
<b>It is my job to incinerate you,
along with your ideals!</b>

11:36.460 --> 11:38.090
<b>I want a piece of the action!</b>

11:38.090 --> 11:39.470
<b>Now it's two against two.</b>

11:40.300 --> 11:41.090
<b>Leone!</b>

11:41.090 --> 11:43.640
<b>Don't worry about me.</b>

11:43.640 --> 11:45.760
<b>Just focus on the battle!</b>

11:46.180 --> 11:48.060
<b>They're strong. Be careful.</b>

11:48.060 --> 11:49.100
<b>Yeah.</b>

11:49.100 --> 11:52.020
<b>Let's defeat Bols and head straight for Kurome!</b>

11:54.230 --> 11:56.360
<b><i>The injuries Esdeath inflicted upon me</i></b>

11:56.360 --> 12:00.320
<b><i>have left me at around forty percent of my full strength.</i></b>

12:02.320 --> 12:03.780
<b><i>But I'm more agile than I thought!</i></b>

12:09.080 --> 12:10.290
<b>That's Earth Shaker!</b>

12:17.090 --> 12:18.840
<b>I'm well aware of your moves.</b>

12:18.840 --> 12:21.380
<b>They've been ingrained in me from training!</b>

12:24.510 --> 12:25.890
<b>Reel Assault!</b>

12:34.600 --> 12:36.690
<b>Wanna get a drink, Naje?</b>

12:46.280 --> 12:49.870
<b>Wh-What Relic could desecrate people so grossly?!</b>

13:17.900 --> 13:22.150
<b>Looks like we're both pretty hard to kill.</b>

13:22.990 --> 13:24.530
<b>It's decaying, but it's still ultra-class.</b>

13:24.530 --> 13:26.200
<b>A tough opponent even for you.</b>

13:26.200 --> 13:27.740
<b>That's true, but...</b>

13:28.120 --> 13:29.530
<b>Take a look, Najenda.</b>

13:31.580 --> 13:34.710
<b>That protrusion bothers me very much.</b>

13:35.370 --> 13:37.710
<b>That area is asymmetrical.</b>

13:38.460 --> 13:41.750
<b>I got hit just then because I was paying too much attention to it.</b>

13:41.750 --> 13:42.590
<b>You...</b>

13:43.050 --> 13:46.380
<b>How can you be so impressive
and so bizarre at the same time?</b>

13:46.970 --> 13:50.600
<b><i>Anyway, if we don't deal with Kurome soon,</i></b>

13:50.600 --> 13:52.560
<b><i>someone may actually die.</i></b>

13:53.020 --> 13:56.730
<b>Susanoo! As your master, 
I authorize the use of your hidden ability.</b>

13:57.640 --> 13:59.190
<b>Understood.</b>

14:03.400 --> 14:05.150
<b><i>Together, they're a formidable foe!</i></b>

14:05.150 --> 14:07.400
<b><i>If one of them slowed down, even for a second...</i></b>

14:20.500 --> 14:21.290
<b>A...</b>

14:23.710 --> 14:24.510
<b>A...</b>

14:25.800 --> 14:27.970
<b>Ally...</b>

14:35.470 --> 14:37.520
<b>It's exactly as Akame said.</b>

14:38.480 --> 14:42.730
<b>The dead bodies that Yatsufusa controls don't have a will of their own.</b>

14:42.730 --> 14:46.150
<b>But deep-seated habits and strong emotions remain.</b>

14:47.030 --> 14:51.990
<b>Unfortunately for you,
I'm no survivor of your dead race.</b>

14:59.620 --> 15:00.710
<b>Nice.</b>

15:00.710 --> 15:02.380
<b>That should put a stop to him.</b>

15:02.880 --> 15:04.550
<b>You saved me, Chelsea!</b>

15:05.300 --> 15:08.300
<b>I'll leave the monkey to you, Tatsumi!</b>

15:10.720 --> 15:13.970
<b><i>That plan was pretty bold, even for me.</i></b>

15:13.970 --> 15:18.100
<b><i>I can hardly call Sheele or Bulat unqualified anymore.</i></b>

15:18.600 --> 15:23.940
<b><i>Later, I'll have him take responsibility for making me feel this way.</i></b>

15:26.070 --> 15:29.150
<b><i>You should be easy enough on your own.
I already know your moves.</i></b>

15:29.610 --> 15:32.280
<b><i>To think this Relic turns dead people into mere toys.</i></b>

15:32.990 --> 15:35.030
<b><i>How utterly repulsive!</i></b>

15:35.870 --> 15:37.740
<b>Rest in peace!</b>

15:47.960 --> 15:51.970
<b><i>My snack times have felt shorter and shorter lately.</i></b>

15:55.010 --> 15:57.680
<b><i>I wonder if Wave is okay.</i></b>

15:58.810 --> 16:02.190
<b><i>Though I can't imagine him giving up without a fight.</i></b>

16:04.100 --> 16:05.190
<b><i>Huh?</i></b>

16:05.190 --> 16:07.730
<b><i>Rokgough and Hentarr aren't moving.</i></b>

16:07.730 --> 16:09.150
<b><i>Apeman's down too!</i></b>

16:10.110 --> 16:11.610
<b><i>Well, then.</i></b>

16:11.900 --> 16:14.660
<b><i>It's almost time for the eighth
to make its appearance.</i></b>

16:14.660 --> 16:16.740
<b><i>I'd better head back too.</i></b>

16:20.080 --> 16:22.290
<b><i>What an intense attack.</i></b>

16:22.290 --> 16:26.210
<b><i>If I hadn't absorbed the shock with
Grand Chariot, I'd have died instantly.</i></b>

16:26.630 --> 16:30.550
<b><i>If I don't hurry, Bols and Kurome will be in danger.</i></b>

16:30.550 --> 16:34.260
<b><i>Kurome's strong, but it's like she's not all there.</i></b>

16:34.260 --> 16:37.010
<b><i>She has an almost childlike quality to her.</i></b>

16:37.010 --> 16:38.350
<b><i>I have to do my part.</i></b>

16:40.310 --> 16:41.600
<b>Damn it.</b>

16:41.600 --> 16:45.350
<b>How far did he launch me?</b>

16:49.150 --> 16:51.110
<b>You were pretty skilled.</b>

16:51.110 --> 16:53.150
<b>But you're up against the wrong girl.</b>

16:53.900 --> 16:56.240
<b>I'm a master sniper.</b>

16:59.240 --> 16:59.990
<b>Huh?</b>

17:01.330 --> 17:03.290
<b>Wh-What the hell is this?!</b>

17:03.290 --> 17:06.040
<b>Oh, I see he already got to you.</b>

17:06.040 --> 17:09.130
<b>This newcomer's Kaiser Frog.</b>

17:09.130 --> 17:13.380
<b>He's a deadly amphibian whose
stomach acid can disintegrate anything.</b>

17:13.380 --> 17:14.260
<b>Stop—</b>

17:14.590 --> 17:19.720
<b>I heard from Seryu that Coro ate your friend.</b>

17:20.390 --> 17:23.640
<b>So I thought it'd only be fitting if you met a similar end.</b>

17:24.600 --> 17:27.150
<b>Y-You think I'll let you?</b>

17:27.150 --> 17:30.360
<b>Like hell I will!</b>

17:32.230 --> 17:35.360
<b>Death comes swiftly for us all.</b>

17:35.360 --> 17:36.660
<b>Bye-bye.</b>

17:37.700 --> 17:39.990
<b>Now, then. We'll move on to—</b>

17:40.990 --> 17:43.040
<b>I found you.</b>

17:43.040 --> 17:45.040
<b>Don't think I'll go easy on you</b>

17:45.040 --> 17:47.460
<b>just because you're Akame's sister, Kurome!</b>

17:47.750 --> 17:50.040
<b>You've got guts.</b>

17:50.040 --> 17:54.670
<b>But Natala is ten times stronger than that ape.</b>

17:57.380 --> 17:59.180
<b>Magatama Manifestation!</b>

18:00.680 --> 18:03.180
<b><i>Susanoo also possesses a Berserker-type ability.</i></b>

18:03.180 --> 18:07.770
<b><i>He absorbs his master's life force into the stone on his chest,</i></b>

18:07.770 --> 18:10.150
<b><i>manifesting his power.</i></b>

18:11.360 --> 18:15.740
<b><i>His master will die upon the 
third activation of this move,</i></b>

18:18.280 --> 18:20.070
<b><i>but the power it grants him is tremendous.</i></b>

18:26.000 --> 18:27.290
<b>Yata-no-Kagami!{these are actual things, and if we can leave esdeath's moves in german i don't see why not}</b>

18:46.310 --> 18:48.270
<b>Ame-no-Murakumo!</b>

18:55.860 --> 18:58.490
<b><i>He's as strong as I am, even with Incursio's help!</i></b>

18:58.490 --> 19:00.820
<b><i>No, maybe even stronger!</i></b>

19:03.530 --> 19:05.290
<b>Everything seems to be going well.</b>

19:07.540 --> 19:08.660
<b>What's wrong?</b>

19:11.420 --> 19:13.710
<b>She's still struggling from within.</b>

19:13.710 --> 19:16.670
<b>The stomach acid should stop her, though.</b>

19:18.670 --> 19:20.590
<b>Aw, he's leaking.</b>

19:21.050 --> 19:23.350
<b>Well, that puts a hole in things.{o u}</b>

19:37.940 --> 19:40.240
<b>I went through hell, no thanks to you.</b>

19:40.700 --> 19:43.070
<b>Huh? What's wrong?</b>

19:43.070 --> 19:45.620
<b>I was in trouble! Couldn't you have helped?</b>

19:45.620 --> 19:46.580
<b>Jeez.</b>

19:46.580 --> 19:48.790
<b>I mean, don't look this way, you pervert!</b>

19:48.790 --> 19:50.660
<b>Gimme a break!</b>

19:50.660 --> 19:53.000
<b>Save the squabbling for later, you two.</b>

19:53.420 --> 19:55.460
<b>The battle isn't over yet.</b>

19:55.460 --> 19:56.710
<b>Boss!</b>

19:57.670 --> 19:59.460
<b>What's that? Su, you look awesome!</b>

20:00.090 --> 20:03.260
<b>You wondered how many would die.</b>

20:03.260 --> 20:05.680
<b>You're about to find out, Kurome.</b>

20:07.390 --> 20:08.560
<b>I see.</b>

20:08.560 --> 20:10.270
<b>In that case,</b>

20:11.520 --> 20:14.230
<b>I'll kill you all, here and now.</b>

20:14.230 --> 20:17.610
<b>And maybe I'll turn you into a fresh set of puppets.</b>

20:23.320 --> 20:24.490
<b>Here we go!</b>

20:24.490 --> 20:24.820
<b>Right!</b>

20:28.660 --> 20:31.160
<b>Attacking from above won't save you!</b>

20:33.620 --> 20:35.880
<b>Go!</b>

20:36.210 --> 20:37.000
<b>What?</b>

20:38.000 --> 20:40.880
<b><i>So he's put his bodyguard between us.</i></b>

20:40.880 --> 20:44.630
<b><i>But we'll slip past and go straight for the target!</i></b>

20:47.050 --> 20:48.510
<b>Woll!</b>

20:50.640 --> 20:52.600
<b>You're paying too much attention to Akame!</b>

20:52.600 --> 20:54.850
<b>We've disabled your bodyguard.</b>

20:54.850 --> 20:55.770
<b>You're mine!</b>

20:57.110 --> 20:57.560
<b>What?</b>

21:01.150 --> 21:02.490
<b><i>A hidden bowgun?</i></b>

21:03.240 --> 21:04.030
<b><i>My arm...</i></b>

21:17.920 --> 21:19.800
<b>Your flamethrower tastes terrible.</b>

21:21.250 --> 21:23.510
<b>She took a bite out of my Relic?</b>

21:26.680 --> 21:27.800
<b>Woll!</b>

21:27.800 --> 21:31.220
<b>Your Imperial Relic's useless now, isn't it?</b>

21:31.890 --> 21:34.060
<b><i>She's right. I can't fire it like this.</i></b>

21:34.730 --> 21:35.230
<b><i>In that case...</i></b>

21:41.320 --> 21:42.860
<b><i>I'll blow us all to kingdom come.</i></b>

21:44.690 --> 21:45.860
<b>Wait, don't tell me...</b>

21:54.960 --> 21:55.000
<b>{first frame of ED}</b>

Not wanting to lose
