04:32.790 --> 04:34.750
<b>Tatsumi's still green,</b>

04:34.750 --> 04:36.750

<b><i>I've been recruited to join a

<b><i>Basically, it's a promotion.</i></b>

06:08.760 --> 06:12.560
<b><i>Since this is my first time in the big city, 
I don't want to stroll in looking like a hick.</i></b>

06:12.560 --> 06:14.640
<b><i>These super-cool clothes should help me blend in.</i></b>

06:15.270 --> 06:16.930
<b><i>They were a real hit back home!</i></b>

06:18.100 --> 06:20.980
<b><i>Plus, my mom loaded me up with all this seafood to give as gifts.</i></b>

06:20.980 --> 06:22.610
<b><i>It's top-grade stuff. All bases covered!</i></b>

06:22.610 --> 06:25.280
<b>It's mighty rude to turn up at a new job without gifts! Take these, y'hear?</b>

06:26.190 --> 06:26.940

06:26.940 --> 06:28.700
<b>Wow, what a hick.</b>

06:27.650 --> 06:28.700
<b>Total country bumpkin.</b>

<b><i>It might just be my imagination, but I can't help but feel like people are looking at me funny.</i></b>

<b><i>Did I do something rude?</i></b>

06:33.830 --> 06:34.910
<b>A hillbilly.</b>

06:34.910 --> 06:35.950
<b>Yeah, fresh out of the sticks.</b>

06:38.870 --> 06:39.870
<b><i>Well...</i></b>

06:39.870 --> 06:44.000
<b>I've clashed with pirates

08:47.420 --> 08:49.880
<b>Valuing one's first impression...</b>

08:49.880 --> 08:52.380
<b>The very definition of "stylish."</b>

<b>It's a guy thing.</b>

<b><i>He swings </i>that<i> way?!</i></b>

08:57.640 --> 08:58.510
<b>Oh, my.</b>

08:58.510 --> 09:00.390
<b>I can see you're a country boy.</b>

09:00.390 --> 09:02.270
<b>But you're quite the looker.</b>

09:02.270 --> 09:04.940
<b>In my hands, you'll shine.</b>

09:04.940 --> 09:06.480
<b>Looking forward to it.</b>

09:06.940 --> 09:08.440
<b><i>And he's taken a liking to me.</i></b>

09:08.440 --> 09:09.820
<b>Hello.</b>

09:11.480 --> 09:14.030
<b>Looks like I'm the last to arrive.</b>

09:14.950 --> 09:17.280
<b>Nice to meet you. Name's Wave.</b>

09:17.280 --> 09:20.700
<b>I'm Run. The pleasure is all mine.</b>

09:22.870 --> 09:25.660
<b><i>Finally! A normal person!</i></b>

09:25.660 --> 09:26.670
<b>Um...</b>

09:26.670 --> 09:29.590
<b>I've made some tea for everyone.</b>

09:30.670 --> 09:31.920
<b>I'm really sorry.</b>

09:31.920 --> 09:34.670
<b>I was the first one here, but I didn't say a thing.</b>

09:35.300 --> 09:38.090
<b>I'm what you'd call "painfully shy,"</b>

09:38.090 --> 09:39.890
<b>so I was nervous.</b>

09:40.300 --> 09:43.390
<b>And I probably have the most seniority here, too.</b>

09:43.390 --> 09:45.180
<b>I have to get it together!</b>

09:45.180 --> 09:48.480
<b>I'm sure we'll all get along as fellow Relic-wielders!</b>

09:48.480 --> 09:51.150
<b>I'm Bols, of the Incineration Squad.</b>

09:52.530 --> 09:55.240
<b><i>"Shy" isn't how I'd describe him.</i></b>

09:55.650 --> 09:57.950
<b><i>The Incineration Squad...</i></b>

09:57.950 --> 10:02.620
<b><i>The stylish squadron that burns anything to ashes, be it man, beast, or object.</i></b>

10:02.620 --> 10:04.910
<b><i>No wonder he looks like that.</i></b>

10:05.450 --> 10:07.040
<b><i>He's not my type.</i></b>

10:12.340 --> 10:13.710
<b>Huh? Who are you?</b>

10:13.710 --> 10:15.920
<b>What are you all doing here?</b>

10:16.300 --> 10:17.010
<b>Hey, hey...</b>

10:17.010 --> 10:18.550
<b>We were told to meet here.</b>

10:22.970 --> 10:24.770
<b>The rebels employ many assassins.</b>

10:24.770 --> 10:26.600
<b>Don't ever let your guard down!</b>

10:28.270 --> 10:30.020
<b>Commendable reflexes.</b>

10:35.230 --> 10:38.700
<b>You were far too conspicuous for someone attempting a sneak attack.</b>

10:41.280 --> 10:44.120
<b>Even if you're just messing around, I won't hold back.</b>

10:47.080 --> 10:49.290
<b>So that's the Imperial Relic Yatsufusa, is it?</b>

10:49.290 --> 10:51.380
<b>What an impressive blade.</b>

10:52.750 --> 10:54.710
<b>General Esdeath!</b>

10:55.300 --> 10:56.920
<b>Ouch.</b>

10:58.800 --> 11:01.340
<b><i>Even our boss is weird!</i></b>

11:03.180 --> 11:05.470
<b>Did I surprise you earlier?</b>

11:05.470 --> 11:08.180
<b>I figured a normal greeting would be uninteresting.</b>

11:08.180 --> 11:10.480
<b>I'm used to harsh training.</b>

11:10.480 --> 11:12.440
<b>In fact, thank you for the lesson!</b>

11:12.810 --> 11:13.770
<b>All right, then.</b>

11:13.770 --> 11:16.570
<b>We have a party to attend 
after we meet with the emperor.</b>

11:16.570 --> 11:18.440
<b>W-We're already meeting him?</b>

11:18.440 --> 11:20.990
<b>This is a pretty fast-paced schedule for our first day of work.</b>

11:21.450 --> 11:23.740
<b>I believe in getting the tedious parts out of the way first.</b>

11:23.740 --> 11:25.830
<b>But before that, Lady Esdeath...</b>

11:25.830 --> 11:28.500
<b>What shall we call ourselves?</b>

11:30.000 --> 11:32.750
<b>We are a unique organization,</b>

11:32.750 --> 11:35.750
<b>ordered to mercilessly hunt down 
and eliminate traitorous elements.</b>

11:36.460 --> 11:39.510
<b>We are the special unit known as...</b>

11:39.880 --> 11:41.340
<b>the Jaegers!{ughhh japan}</b>

11:41.970 --> 11:48.850
<b><i>I'm glad the seafood I brought 
is being served up as the main course.</i></b>

11:48.850 --> 11:51.890
<b><i>But isn't it kinda off that 
</i>we're<i> the ones who can cook here?</i></b>

11:51.890 --> 11:53.310
<b>Wave.</b>

11:53.310 --> 11:55.690
<b>The spinach should go in last.</b>

11:55.690 --> 11:57.480
<b>If you add it too early, it'll get soft.</b>

11:57.480 --> 11:58.820
<b>Oh, sorry.</b>

11:59.280 --> 12:03.490
<b>By the way, I was relieved to 
find out you're a nice guy after all.</b>

12:04.870 --> 12:08.200
<b>I'm not... nice at all...</b>

12:08.870 --> 12:09.660
<b>General!</b>

12:10.160 --> 12:13.420
<b>What do you like to do in your free time here?{did they dress up in fancy suits for a single scene or what}</b>

12:13.830 --> 12:15.290
<b>Mostly hunting, torturing,</b>

12:15.290 --> 12:17.000
<b>and research thereof.</b>

12:17.800 --> 12:19.000
<b>But at the moment...</b>

12:20.010 --> 12:22.930
<b>I'm interested in falling in love.</b>

12:23.260 --> 12:23.800
<b><i>Love?</i></b>

12:25.640 --> 12:26.640
<b>On another note,</b>

12:26.640 --> 12:29.680
<b>I've been informed that we have a spare Relic at our disposal.</b>

12:29.680 --> 12:30.720
<b>Oh, uh... That's right.</b>

12:31.390 --> 12:35.060
<b>We recovered a Relic shaped like a giant pair of scissors from the forces of evil. It's at HQ.</b>

12:35.060 --> 12:37.730
<b>They haven't found anyone 
compatible with it yet, though.</b>

12:37.730 --> 12:41.240
<b>If no one is found, the prime minister will claim it as his own.</b>

12:41.240 --> 12:42.650
<b>Which would be a shame.</b>

12:42.650 --> 12:46.120
<b>Perhaps we should put on a show to help us find a capable wielder.{end of part a}</b>

12:53.660 --> 12:54.670
<b>Hey.</b>

12:54.670 --> 12:55.500
<b>Yo.</b>

12:58.790 --> 13:00.050
<b>Whoa!</b>

13:02.880 --> 13:05.260
<b>This really does feel like a secret base!</b>

13:05.260 --> 13:06.180
<b>Right?</b>

13:06.180 --> 13:07.470
<b>It's my pride and joy!</b>

13:07.470 --> 13:09.470
<b>But you didn't make it or anything, did you?</b>

13:09.470 --> 13:10.930
<b>Hey there!</b>

13:10.930 --> 13:13.310
<b>Welcome to our secret base in the capital!</b>

13:13.310 --> 13:14.560
<b>You're taking it way too easy!</b>

13:14.940 --> 13:17.840
<b>Anyway, Mine's now showing up on the wanted posters as well,</b>

13:17.840 --> 13:22.190
<b>so only the three of us 
can walk around outside.</b>

13:22.190 --> 13:24.700
<b>And that new special unit's the talk of the town.</b>

13:24.700 --> 13:28.740
<b>They call themselves the Jaegers.</b>

13:28.740 --> 13:31.120
<b>Makes sense, given that Esdeath is their leader.</b>

13:31.120 --> 13:32.540
<b>Infamy is a sure way to get noticed,</b>

13:33.000 --> 13:34.500
<b>and everyone fears her name.</b>

13:35.540 --> 13:38.130
<b>What is it that makes her so fearsome?</b>

13:38.790 --> 13:40.460
<b>Let's see...</b>

13:40.460 --> 13:42.500
<b>Here's one example.</b>

13:43.590 --> 13:45.260
<b>A few years ago,</b>

13:45.260 --> 13:50.100
<b>a tribe to the southwest rebelled 
against the empire's tyrannical rule.</b>

13:50.100 --> 13:52.770
<b>In response, the empire dispatched a special force to subjugate them.</b>

13:52.770 --> 13:54.890
<b>The tribe had about 10,000 warriors,</b>

13:54.890 --> 13:56.560
<b>and the empire sent 120,000 soldiers.</b>

13:56.560 --> 13:58.850
<b>People assumed the battle 
would be over before it begun.</b>

13:59.440 --> 14:00.360
<b>However...</b>

14:00.360 --> 14:02.820
<b>The land was harsh and fraught with danger.</b>

14:03.570 --> 14:05.940
<b>The soldiers, who had grown up 
coddled by the capital,</b>

14:05.940 --> 14:08.950
<b>were soon overwhelmed by the raw brutality of nature.</b>

14:09.700 --> 14:14.240
<b>On top of that, they had to fend off 
guerrilla attacks from the tribe every night.</b>

14:14.240 --> 14:15.950
<b>Feeling pressured, the empire</b>

14:15.950 --> 14:20.830
<b>dispatched the young but capable 
Generals Najenda and Esdeath as reinforcements.</b>

14:22.170 --> 14:23.460
<b>General Esdeath,</b>

14:23.460 --> 14:24.840
<b>you seem gloomier than usual.</b>

14:25.260 --> 14:26.920
<b>Of course I am.</b>

14:26.920 --> 14:31.300
<b>The prime minister has ordered us to end the insurgence swiftly with our Relics.</b>

14:31.300 --> 14:35.100
<b>Withstanding the harsh conditions 
which routed even our special forces</b>

14:35.100 --> 14:37.350
<b>would be a thrilling challenge for us.</b>

14:37.350 --> 14:38.980
<b>This directive robs us of that enjoyment.</b>

14:39.850 --> 14:40.980
<b>But orders are orders.</b>

14:45.610 --> 14:49.150
<b>Whether they be beast, insect,</b>

14:49.150 --> 14:51.120
<b>epidemic, or virus,</b>

14:52.780 --> 14:55.540
<b>all in my path</b>

14:55.540 --> 14:56.700
<b>shall freeze.</b>

14:59.750 --> 15:02.670
<b>Wh-What power...</b>

15:04.670 --> 15:06.550
<b>Make a beeline for the enemy HQ and destroy them!</b>

15:08.550 --> 15:10.930
<b>My strikes are as destructive as any siege engine!</b>

15:10.930 --> 15:12.680
<b>Musket troops, fire!</b>

15:18.140 --> 15:20.060
<b>Now that the enemy's wiped out,</b>

15:20.060 --> 15:21.810
<b>it's time to have some fun.</b>

15:22.650 --> 15:25.230
<b>Ravage this town to your hearts' content.</b>

15:27.190 --> 15:28.440
<b>Are you watching?</b>

15:28.440 --> 15:30.820
<b>Can you see your homes burn?</b>

15:30.820 --> 15:32.360
<b>Damn you! Just kill us!</b>

15:32.360 --> 15:34.530
<b>I'm a merciful woman.</b>

15:34.530 --> 15:36.240
<b>I feel pity for you, if nothing else.</b>

15:36.240 --> 15:38.290
<b>So I'll let you guys go.</b>

15:38.290 --> 15:39.160
<b>Like hell you will!</b>

15:39.160 --> 15:42.460
<b>If you don't kill us now, we <i>will</i> get our revenge—</b>

15:43.130 --> 15:44.250
<b>Remember this.</b>

15:44.250 --> 15:47.420
<b>The weak are destined to lie 
beneath the boots of the strong.</b>

15:47.420 --> 15:49.630
<b>If that angers you, overcome your deficits.</b>

15:49.630 --> 15:51.260
<b><i>I won't stand for this.</i></b>

15:51.260 --> 15:53.970
<b><i>Not the empire's orders to make an example of them,</i></b>

15:53.970 --> 15:56.510
<b><i>and not those who relish in this savagery.</i></b>

15:58.810 --> 16:00.270
<b>So that's what happened.</b>

16:00.270 --> 16:04.060
<b>Letting the tribesmen live after all that 
must have been the ultimate humiliation.</b>

16:04.060 --> 16:06.270
<b>In fact, from the empire's perspective,</b>

16:06.270 --> 16:08.570
<b>isn't it basically adding fuel to the fire?</b>

16:08.570 --> 16:11.450
<b>That's exactly what Esdeath wants.</b>

16:11.450 --> 16:13.570
<b>The more rebellions she can spark,</b>

16:13.570 --> 16:16.330
<b>the more battle she can relish.</b>

16:16.910 --> 16:18.040
<b>That's insane.</b>

16:19.240 --> 16:20.500
<b>She's one nasty customer.</b>

16:20.500 --> 16:24.000
<b>I'm glad I decided not to mess with her on my own.</b>

16:24.830 --> 16:28.500
<b>I wonder how many hundreds of thousands of kills it took for her to gain that evil aura.</b>

16:28.500 --> 16:32.010
<b>She even scared <i>you</i> off? 
How monstrous can she be?</b>

16:32.590 --> 16:34.340
<b>If you're curious, why not find out first-hand?{no why would you do this}</b>

16:34.840 --> 16:37.300
<b>Esdeath's sponsoring a city-wide martial arts tournament.</b>

16:37.300 --> 16:39.560
<b>The winner gets a cash reward.</b>

16:39.560 --> 16:41.980
<b>Maybe you can earn some money to send back to your hometown.</b>

16:44.650 --> 16:45.770
<b>Say, Prime Minister...</b>

16:46.190 --> 16:49.980
<b>Why do you think General Esdeath said she wants to fall in love?</b>

16:49.980 --> 16:54.200
<b>Everyone desires the opposite sex once they reach a certain age.</b>

16:54.780 --> 16:58.740
<b>General Esdeath was practically born to fight.</b>

16:58.740 --> 17:01.620
<b>Until now, she's always chosen battle over everything else. {ha ha, hana yori ikusen}</b>

17:01.620 --> 17:04.160
<b>But it seems different desires have blossomed within her.</b>

17:04.160 --> 17:05.580
<b>I see.</b>

17:05.580 --> 17:08.170
<b>I'd like to help her find someone suitable.</b>

17:08.170 --> 17:10.750
<b>She is a very proud woman.</b>

17:10.750 --> 17:14.420
<b>I'm sure she won't accept anyone less than perfect for her.</b>

17:14.930 --> 17:17.140
<b>But no man like this exists.</b>

17:17.590 --> 17:21.770
<b><i>Above all, he must possess great potential.{or great future prospects}</i></b>

17:21.770 --> 17:24.690
<b><i>I would like to personally train him into a highly ranked general.</i></b>

17:24.690 --> 17:29.150
<b><i>Second, he must be fearless 
and able to hunt Danger Beasts.</i></b>

17:29.150 --> 17:34.030
<b><i>Third, much like myself, he must have been raised far outside the capital.</i></b>

17:34.030 --> 17:37.780
<b>"Fourth, I require a younger man who is easier to control."</b>

17:37.780 --> 17:41.790
<b>"Fifth, it would be nice for him to have a pure, innocent smile."</b>

17:43.580 --> 17:46.790
<b>Most men wouldn't even make it 
past the first requirement.</b>

17:47.540 --> 17:50.790
<b>And not just anyone can be trained 
into a highly ranked general, either.</b>

18:00.800 --> 18:03.220
<b>What do you think of them?</b>

18:03.220 --> 18:06.310
<b>Dull warriors make for a dull fight.</b>

18:06.310 --> 18:10.360
<b>I guess I was overly optimistic to hope someone fit to wield a Relic would show up.</b>

18:10.360 --> 18:12.270
<b>Oh, it seems they've chosen the winner.</b>

18:12.270 --> 18:14.740
<b>The winner is Nobunaga the Dried-Goods Merchant!</b>

18:14.740 --> 18:15.900
<b>I did it!</b>

18:16.240 --> 18:18.860
<b>Next up is the final match.</b>

18:20.160 --> 18:21.330
<b>On the east side...</b>

18:21.330 --> 18:22.620
<b>Kalbi the Butcher!</b>

18:22.620 --> 18:23.790
<b>And on the west side...</b>

18:23.790 --> 18:25.080
<b>Tatsumi the Blacksmith!</b>

18:25.080 --> 18:27.250
<b>That's an interesting title.</b>

18:27.250 --> 18:28.500
<b>How is he at striking iron?</b>

18:28.500 --> 18:30.040
<b>Not as good as me,</b>

18:30.040 --> 18:32.130
<b>but he's not half bad.</b>

18:32.130 --> 18:34.130
<b>It looks like one of them is a young man.</b>

18:36.840 --> 18:39.090
<b>Who's this shrimp?</b>

18:39.090 --> 18:41.550
<b>The prize money's as good as mine!</b>

18:43.100 --> 18:45.020
<b>I may have been excommunicated,</b>

18:45.020 --> 18:47.560
<b>but I'm still a ninth-level master at Koukenji.</b>

18:47.560 --> 18:49.100
<b><i>This old guy...</i></b>

18:49.100 --> 18:51.770
<b><i>He's got the bite to match his bark.</i></b>

18:51.770 --> 18:55.030
<b><i>These fights used to scare the hell out of me,</i></b>

18:55.030 --> 18:56.820
<b><i>but now I'm perfectly calm.</i></b>

18:57.240 --> 19:01.200
<b><i>Compared to the Three, 
this guy doesn't intimidate me at all!</i></b>

19:03.200 --> 19:04.330
<b>Begin!</b>

19:04.950 --> 19:07.410
<b>I'll serve you a full course of my fists!</b>

19:07.410 --> 19:10.120
<b><i>I don't even need Incursio for the likes of him.</i></b>

19:40.200 --> 19:40.860
<b>Whoa!</b>

19:40.860 --> 19:42.160
<b>Wow!</b>

19:43.570 --> 19:46.160
<b>That young man is outstandingly talented.</b>

19:46.160 --> 19:47.160
<b>Yeah.</b>

19:47.160 --> 19:48.620
<b>That'll be all!</b>

19:49.160 --> 19:50.460
<b>The winner is Tatsumi!</b>

19:54.580 --> 19:57.130
<b><i>Everyone is cheering for me.</i></b>

19:58.050 --> 19:59.340
<b>I did it!</b>

20:03.760 --> 20:05.390
<b>We've found him.</b>

20:05.390 --> 20:07.350
<b>A potential Relic-wielder, I take it?</b>

20:07.350 --> 20:08.770
<b>That too.</b>

20:08.770 --> 20:09.730
<b>But more importantly...{aaaaaaa}</b>

20:10.560 --> 20:11.560
<b>Commander?</b>

20:14.900 --> 20:17.320
<b><i>She's entering the ring herself?</i></b>

20:21.490 --> 20:24.160
<b>Tatsumi. That's your name, right?</b>

20:24.160 --> 20:25.120
<b>I like it.</b>

20:25.120 --> 20:26.580
<b>Th-Thanks.</b>

20:26.580 --> 20:28.580
<b><i>So this is Esdeath,</i></b>

20:28.580 --> 20:30.540
<b><i>former commander of the Three.</i></b>

20:32.750 --> 20:35.880
<b><i>If it weren't for her, Bro would still...</i></b>

20:35.880 --> 20:38.210
<b>Your victory just now was magnificent.</b>

20:38.210 --> 20:39.710
<b>I'd like to reward you for your efforts.</b>

20:40.460 --> 20:42.260
<b>Thank you very much.</b>

20:42.260 --> 20:45.220
<b><i>Regardless of the source, money is money.</i></b>

20:45.220 --> 20:46.890
<b><i>I'll be glad to accept it.</i></b>

20:49.060 --> 20:50.100
<b>Huh?</b>

20:50.100 --> 20:53.060
<b>From now on, you belong to me.</b>

20:53.060 --> 20:54.520
<b>Wh-What?</b>

20:54.520 --> 20:56.610
<b>There are too many distractions out here.</b>

20:56.610 --> 20:57.610
<b>Come to my palace.</b>

20:57.610 --> 20:58.360
<b>Wait!</b>

20:58.360 --> 20:59.940
<b>I simply can't.</b>

21:00.320 --> 21:02.190
<b><i>What did she do to me?</i></b>

21:04.030 --> 21:06.360
<b>Let us take this to my chambers.</b>

21:06.360 --> 21:07.700
<b>Just the two of us.</b>

21:08.580 --> 21:12.620
<b>Wh-What the hell is going on?!</b>

21:13.080 --> 21:14.830
<b>Tatsumi's been taken by Esdeath?{if you know what i mean wink wink}</b>

21:14.830 --> 21:17.500
<b>Did she find out he was a Night Raid member?</b>

21:17.500 --> 21:19.250
<b>I don't really know...</b>

21:19.250 --> 21:21.550
<b>Maybe, maybe not.</b>

21:21.550 --> 21:24.970
<b>We saw them go into the palace, but that's it.</b>

21:24.970 --> 21:26.090
<b>What do we do, acting boss?</b>

21:27.890 --> 21:29.050
<b>Tatsumi...</b>

21:29.050 --> 21:30.720
<b>I will not die!</b>

21:32.640 --> 21:35.690
<b>It better not be something stupid like rescuing him, Akame.</b>

21:36.810 --> 21:39.900
<b>For the time being, let's move our hideout further into the mountains.</b>

21:39.900 --> 21:40.860
<b>That's a good idea.</b>

21:40.860 --> 21:42.650
<b>They might find us here.</b>

21:42.650 --> 21:44.900
<b>So what do we do about Tatsumi?</b>

21:44.900 --> 21:46.660
<b>We may not be able to save him.</b>

21:46.660 --> 21:47.660
<b>I'm aware of that.</b>

21:48.030 --> 21:50.120
<b>We won't rush in without a plan,</b>

21:50.120 --> 21:53.040
<b>but Tatsumi is a valued comrade of ours!</b>

21:53.040 --> 21:54.410
<b>We'll do whatever we can!</b>

21:54.410 --> 21:56.410
<b></b>

21:55.040 --> 21:55.080
{ED first frame}

22:06.060 --> 22:11.770
utsuro na me wo shite

22:06.060 --> 22:11.770
Your eyes look empty

22:11.770 --> 22:15.200
nani wo tsutaetai no

22:11.770 --> 22:15.200
What is it you want to say

22:17.290 --> 22:26.360
ukande wa kiete iku anata no zanzou

22:17.290 --> 22:26.360
Your after-image  floats away and disappears into nothingness

22:28.150 --> 22:33.250
hikitomenaide sono yasashisatte douse

22:28.150 --> 22:33.250
Please don't hold me back

22:33.250 --> 22:37.710

22:33.250 --> 22:37.710
I know your kindness lacks any responsibility

22:38.720 --> 22:44.040
tsuyoku nakya atashi wa ikiru imi mo nai

22:38.720 --> 22:44.040
If I can't be stronger, I have no reason to live

22:44.040 --> 22:48.770
isso kowashite yo

22:44.040 --> 22:48.770
So just break me already

22:50.690 --> 22:56.000
itoshisa de kokoro wa moroku nari

22:50.690 --> 22:56.000
Love makes my heart grow brittle

22:56.000 --> 23:01.470
nigiritsubuseru hodo yasashikutte

22:56.000 --> 23:01.470
So gentle it threatens to crush it

23:01.470 --> 23:11.780
dare ni mo mise ta koto nai yowa sa ga hitotsu dake kobore ta

23:01.470 --> 23:11.780
Of the weaknesses I've never shown anyone, one has come tumbling out

23:13.090 --> 23:17.970
donna itami mo gaman dekita no yo

23:13.090 --> 23:17.970
I've persevered through every sort of pain

23:17.970 --> 23:23.940
shiritaku nanka nakatta

23:17.970 --> 23:23.940
And I wish I'd never known any of it

Kill   the   Temptation

23:33.140 --> 23:40.060
Kill   the   Temptation
