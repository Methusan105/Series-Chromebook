00:01.690 --> 00:02.900
Here's our chance!

00:08.950 --> 00:11.320
All right!

00:11.320 --> 00:12.410
Nice spike!

00:12.780 --> 00:14.120
Nice spike!

00:14.120 --> 00:16.830
Karasuno               Date Tech

00:14.120 --> 00:16.830
Karasuno               Date Tech

00:14.740 --> 00:16.830
Tsukishima, serve up another point!

00:19.250 --> 00:25.670
If they keep trading momentum back and forth, Karasuno will probably take the first set.

00:19.620 --> 00:20.960
Nice receive!

00:20.960 --> 00:22.290
Watch out for number seven!

00:22.290 --> 00:23.090
Right side!

00:26.210 --> 00:28.340
But in order to get that vital lead...

00:29.930 --> 00:30.550
you need this!

00:30.550 --> 00:31.760
Nice job getting a hand on it!

00:31.760 --> 00:32.970
Counter!

00:32.970 --> 00:34.220
This is our chance to score!

00:35.010 --> 00:35.890
<i>C Quick!</i>

00:35.890 --> 00:36.850
I don't think so!

00:39.980 --> 00:46.150
This is the first time they've put two blockers on Hinata and Kageyama's fast attack.

00:47.610 --> 00:49.610
Karasuno               Date Tech

00:47.610 --> 00:49.610
Karasuno               Date Tech

00:50.610 --> 00:51.610
Wow.

00:52.570 --> 00:55.870
Set point for us against the famous Date Tech?

00:57.040 --> 00:57.040
{OP}

01:01.670 --> 01:07.010
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

01:01.670 --> 01:07.010
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

01:11.680 --> 01:18.060
I take two deep breaths and calm my heart

01:18.310 --> 01:24.730
I take a step with my left foot to break the silence

01:25.440 --> 01:31.900
Get your nervousness in check and reign in your mind

01:32.240 --> 01:35.450
You have it in you

01:35.450 --> 01:38.290
You can cast out the demons

01:39.160 --> 01:45.420
Fate? Random chance? Questions? Answers? It's all one

01:45.420 --> 01:47.710
This is the sign

01:52.050 --> 01:53.890
Oh, yeah!

01:53.890 --> 01:56.510
The world is opening to us

01:56.510 --> 01:59.560
We pass the door,

01:59.560 --> 02:05.730
look straight ahead, and never look back

02:05.730 --> 02:07.650
Oh, yeah!

02:07.650 --> 02:13.360
I put my hand to my chest

02:13.360 --> 02:19.490
I can feel the proof that I exist

02:19.490 --> 02:23.620
It is my beating heart

02:27.000 --> 02:27.000
{Part A}

02:32.760 --> 02:34.220
Nice receive!

02:32.880 --> 02:36.140
Episode Eighteen: 
Back Protection

02:32.880 --> 02:36.140
Episode Eighteen: 
Back Protection

02:34.220 --> 02:36.140
Karasuno's really in the groove!

02:36.140 --> 02:37.600
Give me a set!

02:47.940 --> 02:49.400
Right on!

02:55.240 --> 02:57.490
Karasuno               Date Tech

02:55.240 --> 02:57.490
Karasuno               Date Tech

02:56.860 --> 03:00.120
Whoa! Karasuno seriously took the set.

03:00.790 --> 03:04.210
Karasuno can be scary once they get their groove on.

03:04.210 --> 03:07.290
Do you think they'll keep it up 
and take the second set as well?

03:04.790 --> 03:06.210
Thank you!

03:08.630 --> 03:11.460
Kunimi, wake up! Move your feet! Warm up properly!

03:09.340 --> 03:13.840
I doubt we'll see the same developments we saw in the first set.

03:15.050 --> 03:16.590
That was close, Aone!

03:15.050 --> 03:18.720
Date Tech, or rather their bulky number seven in particular,

03:17.510 --> 03:18.720
We can take the next one!

03:18.720 --> 03:22.520
is getting over the initial shock of the surprise fast attack.

03:23.180 --> 03:30.730
Their big number seven, and also their number six toward the end, actually touched our fast attack.

03:30.730 --> 03:32.480
Yeah, they're good.

03:33.280 --> 03:36.780
<i>In our current state, our attack axis is the deviant fast attack.</i>

03:37.410 --> 03:41.160
<i>We can't have it contained like
 it was when we played Nekoma.</i>

03:42.580 --> 03:47.670
{=0}Azumane

03:42.740 --> 03:47.170
Which is why we will start our rotation two places ahead for the second set.

03:48.540 --> 03:49.380
The first set rotation

03:50.460 --> 03:55.550
matched up number seven, 
AKA "No Brows," head-on with Hinata.

03:55.550 --> 03:58.510
So we're starting the set two positions ahead.

03:58.510 --> 03:59.840
I get it.

03:59.840 --> 04:06.100
Then Hinata can avoid being marked by number seven as closely as he was in the first set.

04:08.190 --> 04:11.020
But he won't go completely unmarked.

04:11.020 --> 04:13.900
The test is to keep them as separated as possible.

04:13.900 --> 04:14.530
Besides...

04:15.320 --> 04:21.370
The less Hinata is marked, and this is obvious, the more the others will be marked.

04:21.370 --> 04:23.910
We can't keep depending on Hinata either.

04:24.870 --> 04:27.620
Keeping Hinata in play keeps the rest of us in play.

04:28.290 --> 04:31.460
I'll prove to you that I'm up to the task of being the ace.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.130
Asahi, you're so cool!

04:35.130 --> 04:36.880
How you've grown, Asahi.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.130
Are we family?!

04:38.130 --> 04:39.180
Same here!

04:40.840 --> 04:45.520
I can't do back attacks like you, Asahi,

04:45.520 --> 04:48.140
so I'll score lots of points while I'm up front!

04:48.480 --> 04:51.480
And I'll be the greatest decoy!

04:53.150 --> 04:55.110
Great. I'm counting on it.

04:55.110 --> 04:56.610
And you can count on me!

04:57.940 --> 04:58.740
Yes, sir!

04:59.570 --> 05:03.030
Go, go, let's go! Let's go, Date Tech!

04:59.570 --> 05:03.030
<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

04:59.570 --> 05:03.030
<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

05:04.950 --> 05:06.740
The second set is starting.

05:07.870 --> 05:09.790
You've got it rough too, Tsukishima.

05:10.460 --> 05:15.040
You'll be opposite their number seven a lot more in this set.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.460
Not at all.

05:16.460 --> 05:22.130
No one is expecting me to face off against number seven and win.

05:22.930 --> 05:25.510
Rocking the house is Hinata's job.

05:26.430 --> 05:32.230
My job is to hold down the fort as much as possible while he's in the back row.

05:32.940 --> 05:34.940
It's no different from the norm.

05:35.310 --> 05:41.150
Besides, no matter how you look at it, their blockers have singled you out.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.120
Give us a good serve, Tanaka!

05:46.370 --> 05:47.290
Nice receive!

05:47.290 --> 05:50.000
Karasuno has moved up their rotation.

05:48.160 --> 05:49.000
Left side!

05:50.000 --> 05:54.080
Did they do it to avoid matchups 
between their number ten and Aone?

05:56.960 --> 06:00.010
Nice spike, Sasaya!

05:58.340 --> 06:03.180
No matter the matchup, we just have to stop the spiker in front of us.

06:02.050 --> 06:03.180
Go, go, Sasaya!

06:03.760 --> 06:07.600
We're your average, snotty delinquents when we're out of uniform.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.560
We have to be good juniors for the duration of the match.

06:13.230 --> 06:14.150
Kageyama!

06:14.150 --> 06:15.860
Yes!

06:21.360 --> 06:25.030
<i>Hinata had him on the hook, 
but he dropped it and went left!</i>

06:27.030 --> 06:29.040
Date Tech              Karasuno

06:27.030 --> 06:29.040
Date Tech              Karasuno

06:30.750 --> 06:31.450
Nice, Tanaka!

06:31.830 --> 06:32.790
Nice receive!

06:32.790 --> 06:33.290
I'm open!

06:33.790 --> 06:34.830
Watch for number three!

06:36.750 --> 06:38.420
Yes!

06:38.420 --> 06:42.920
It's only because they were targeting the long-haired guy.

06:43.630 --> 06:47.430
Only Short-stuff can do fast attacks
 when the receives are all over the place.

06:47.760 --> 06:48.890
Nice, Aone!

06:48.890 --> 06:51.390
All right! We'll stop the next one too!

06:53.520 --> 06:54.850
Nice, Sawamura!

06:57.270 --> 06:59.570
Date Tech                   Karasuno

06:57.270 --> 06:59.570
Date Tech                   Karasuno

06:57.730 --> 06:58.900
All right!

06:59.940 --> 07:03.490
Hey, Karasuno's number ten has come up to the front row.

07:00.860 --> 07:02.440
All right, bring it!

07:05.780 --> 07:06.950
It's up! Nice going!

07:06.950 --> 07:08.530
Kageyama, cover it!

07:09.120 --> 07:10.240
Send it my way!

07:13.080 --> 07:14.410
Yes!

07:13.830 --> 07:16.620
He's even faster when he's right in front of you!

07:14.410 --> 07:16.120
Nice, Hinata, Kageyama!

07:16.620 --> 07:18.080
Is he a monster?!

07:26.050 --> 07:27.430
Yes!

07:27.430 --> 07:31.390
Date Tech              Karasuno

07:27.430 --> 07:31.390
Date Tech              Karasuno

07:29.140 --> 07:31.390
Do you suppose Karasuno's surprise fast attack

07:32.100 --> 07:36.640
got new life when they moved up their rotation?

07:36.640 --> 07:39.900
But the effect will wear off as time passes.

07:39.900 --> 07:44.360
If Date Tech can take this set
 and carry it over to a third set,

07:44.820 --> 07:46.820
Karasuno will lose the advantage.

07:47.610 --> 07:50.320
The question is, how well will Karasuno fight Date Tech's number seven

07:50.320 --> 07:53.830
while their number ten isn't in the front row?

07:54.540 --> 08:00.420
The outcome of the match could very well depend on 
how well they can fight the Iron Wall without their decoy.

08:02.290 --> 08:04.050
Hinata, give us a good serve!

08:04.510 --> 08:07.090
I heard that Karasuno's number ten has an amazing fast attack.

08:04.960 --> 08:06.050
Nice receive!

08:06.050 --> 08:07.090
I'm open!

08:07.090 --> 08:07.930
Who is he?

08:07.930 --> 08:09.510
He's in the back row now.

08:08.340 --> 08:09.510
Yes!

08:09.510 --> 08:11.970
Date Tech              Karasuno

08:09.510 --> 08:11.970
Date Tech              Karasuno

08:11.180 --> 08:11.970
Hey, Tsukishima.

08:13.140 --> 08:19.560
You know how you said it was your job to hold down the fort while Hinata is in the back row?

08:20.270 --> 08:23.900
It's pretty amazing to accomplish that against an opponent like Date Tech.

08:24.980 --> 08:30.610
I know that Hinata and Kageyama are pivotal to our current offense,

08:30.610 --> 08:34.660
but it's also vital to endure while that combination can't be used.

08:35.410 --> 08:40.620
It's just like having to receive to set up the spike even if you can't make the hit directly.

08:41.250 --> 08:46.170
Holding down the fort right now is directly linked to our victory.

08:51.090 --> 08:52.510
Sorry! Kageyama, cover it!

08:52.510 --> 08:53.470
Got it!

08:53.470 --> 08:56.720
<i>When the going gets tough, 
it's the ace who gets all the sets.</i>

08:57.140 --> 08:57.980
I'm open!

08:57.980 --> 08:58.930
Azumane!

08:59.730 --> 09:00.640
The left spiker's coming!

09:01.190 --> 09:02.810
<i>No Iron Wall...</i>

09:06.530 --> 09:07.860
<i>can keep me out!</i>

09:13.820 --> 09:17.040
<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

09:13.820 --> 09:17.040
<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

09:18.080 --> 09:20.500
Date Tech's blocking is awesome!

09:20.500 --> 09:22.250
Asahi, do it again!

09:21.580 --> 09:25.710
Number ten is their middle blocker, but it's almost like he's their ace.

09:22.250 --> 09:23.960
Shake it off!

09:26.340 --> 09:30.050
<i>Number seven's block is the strongest in the Iron Wall.</i>

09:30.840 --> 09:34.140
<i>They need him up front quick or they'll be in trouble.</i>

09:33.090 --> 09:34.680
Let's go for another!

09:34.680 --> 09:36.180
Yeah!

09:36.180 --> 09:40.020
<i>Can you endure, Karasuno's ace?</i>

09:42.100 --> 09:44.100
Date Tech              Karasuno

09:42.100 --> 09:44.100
Date Tech              Karasuno

09:45.310 --> 09:47.110
Daichi, nice receive!

09:47.110 --> 09:47.780
I'm open!

09:47.780 --> 09:48.940
Number three!

09:51.280 --> 09:52.820
<i>I won't be broken twice!</i>

09:55.160 --> 09:55.740
He made contact!

09:55.740 --> 09:57.030
Counter!

09:57.330 --> 09:59.250
You're not the only ones!

10:01.120 --> 10:02.540
Our team has a wall too!

10:03.960 --> 10:04.750
Yeah!

10:04.750 --> 10:06.960
Whoa, they stopped a fast attack!

10:06.960 --> 10:11.130
Numbers three and eleven are the two tallest in Karasuno.

10:07.750 --> 10:09.550
Nice block, Tsukishima!

10:09.550 --> 10:10.340
You're welcome.

10:11.670 --> 10:14.260
Yes! They scored off a block!

10:14.260 --> 10:17.640
Good! Now if Date Tech gets the next point,

10:18.060 --> 10:20.720
their huge number seven will go to the back row!

10:20.720 --> 10:21.680
Next, next!

10:21.680 --> 10:22.770
One more!

10:22.770 --> 10:23.980
Okay!

10:23.980 --> 10:25.480
Now widen the gap!

10:26.730 --> 10:28.400
Yeah!

10:26.730 --> 10:28.940
Date Tech                   Karasuno

10:26.730 --> 10:28.940
Date Tech                   Karasuno

10:27.310 --> 10:30.570
Ooh, Karasuno's number ten is up front!

10:30.570 --> 10:31.990
Okay!

10:32.530 --> 10:34.320
Six more points.

10:34.320 --> 10:37.450
Nail those suckers while you're in the front row, Short-stuff!

10:40.160 --> 10:41.160
Number twelve!

10:42.870 --> 10:44.460
It's up! Kageyama, get it!

10:44.460 --> 10:45.250
Right!

10:45.250 --> 10:46.630
Send it my way!

10:48.250 --> 10:50.550
It really is incredible.

10:50.550 --> 10:55.180
He goes for a fast attack where you'd normally use the left wing spiker.

10:55.590 --> 10:56.760
Take that!

10:57.340 --> 11:00.220
Yes! No getting cocky for you!

11:00.220 --> 11:01.640
Nice, Kamacchi!

11:00.220 --> 11:03.680
<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

11:00.220 --> 11:03.680
<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

11:03.680 --> 11:06.690
Date Tech              Karasuno

11:03.680 --> 11:06.690
Date Tech              Karasuno

11:04.770 --> 11:06.690
It's difficult to widen the lead.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.900
Patience. Proceed carefully.

11:11.780 --> 11:12.990
Nice, Asahi!

11:12.990 --> 11:13.690
Here's our chance!

11:13.690 --> 11:15.450
Give me a set!

11:17.740 --> 11:18.370
<i>Damn—</i>

11:20.700 --> 11:21.580
All right!

11:21.580 --> 11:22.450
Nice spike!

11:22.450 --> 11:23.410
One more!

11:24.160 --> 11:26.120
One more point to match point!

11:26.120 --> 11:27.630
Go! One more point!

11:28.790 --> 11:29.590
Nice receive!

11:29.590 --> 11:33.210
Now Date Tech's huge number seven is in the back row...

11:29.590 --> 11:31.210
Nice receive, Noya!

11:31.210 --> 11:32.340
Here's our chance!

11:33.210 --> 11:35.550
And Short-stuff is still in the front.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.550
This is their chance to widen the lead!

11:39.050 --> 11:44.270
Kamasaki, are you hiding behind Aone and letting him hog the glory?

11:44.270 --> 11:45.020
Huh?!

11:45.020 --> 11:48.230
Screw you! All of us together...

11:50.940 --> 11:52.270
make the Iron Wall!

11:53.940 --> 11:55.780
Yes!

11:56.360 --> 11:57.490
Shit.

11:57.820 --> 11:59.030
Go for the next one!

11:59.030 --> 11:59.740
I'm sorry.

12:00.700 --> 12:04.200
Now their number seven has his turn in the front row.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.450
We're counting on you.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.160
It's okay.

12:05.830 --> 12:07.710
The deviant fast attack will still work!

12:08.830 --> 12:09.630
<i>But...</i>

12:11.670 --> 12:12.540
Nishinoya!

12:12.540 --> 12:13.250
Nice receive!

12:13.630 --> 12:14.590
Send it my way!

12:19.890 --> 12:22.180
That was close. A waterfall ball!

12:22.180 --> 12:24.220
But now it's match point!

12:23.100 --> 12:25.560
Date Tech              Karasuno

12:23.100 --> 12:25.560
Date Tech              Karasuno

12:25.930 --> 12:27.520
Go for the point!

12:27.890 --> 12:29.310
All right!

12:31.230 --> 12:34.020
I know you can stop the next one!

12:34.020 --> 12:35.400
This is only the beginning!

12:38.150 --> 12:40.410
It's match point for Karasuno.

12:40.410 --> 12:42.870
Now number ten is in the back row.

12:44.160 --> 12:48.080
<i>This is Date Tech's strongest turn for blocking.</i>

12:49.670 --> 12:50.540
Give us a good one!

12:54.710 --> 12:55.960
Nice judgment call!

12:55.130 --> 12:57.170
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

12:55.960 --> 12:57.170
We were lucky!

12:57.170 --> 12:58.970
It's okay. Don't sweat it.

12:58.130 --> 13:00.130
Hinata, you moronic, klutzy shit!

12:58.970 --> 13:02.140
Regret it for a second and let it go!

13:00.130 --> 13:01.550
Stop that, you idiot.

13:02.140 --> 13:02.970
Yes, sir!

13:02.970 --> 13:09.440
Date Tech              Karasuno

13:02.970 --> 13:09.440
Date Tech              Karasuno

13:03.470 --> 13:06.060
If Date Tech gets two more points, it'll go to deuce.

13:06.810 --> 13:09.440
It's a distinct possibility in the current rotation.

13:09.890 --> 13:14.400
If it goes to deuce while number ten is out,
 won't Karasuno be in trouble?

13:14.690 --> 13:16.530
Go for the next one! Shake it off!

13:16.530 --> 13:18.740
Date Tech's number seven is amazing.

13:18.740 --> 13:21.610
Yeah. I thought he stopped that last one.

13:22.450 --> 13:26.330
But Asahi is in the front row now.

13:23.160 --> 13:24.870
Now, bring on the point!

13:27.290 --> 13:28.250
<i>Asahi!</i>

13:29.290 --> 13:30.370
<i>Azumane.</i>

13:31.460 --> 13:33.880
The ace is there, so it'll be fine!

13:35.130 --> 13:35.170
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

13:35.170 --> 13:35.210

Tsukishima!

13:55.020 --> 13:56.150
Nice receive!

13:56.150 --> 13:57.150
Watch for the fast attack!

13:56.480 --> 13:59.490
The placement is good, but they're on the lookout.

13:57.150 --> 13:58.440
Number seven!

14:01.570 --> 14:02.400
Cover it!

14:02.400 --> 14:03.160
Azumane!

14:03.160 --> 14:03.780
Right!

14:04.410 --> 14:07.240
<i>What kind of ace can't make the last hit count?!</i>

14:07.240 --> 14:12.160
It has to hold back a spiker it once defeated,
 or it's not worthy of the name "The Iron Wall"!

14:13.170 --> 14:15.130
Moniwa, nice block!

14:16.250 --> 14:18.340
<i>Crap! Nobody's in the back!</i>

14:23.380 --> 14:24.130
It's in the air!

14:24.130 --> 14:24.800
Cover it!

14:25.800 --> 14:28.100
<i>Every set is a chance!</i>

14:28.100 --> 14:30.020
Left! Give me one more!

14:30.600 --> 14:31.480
Azumane!

14:31.810 --> 14:34.270
Is the set a little too close to the net?

14:36.310 --> 14:37.480
It's a joust!

14:37.480 --> 14:39.440
Don't let him beat you, long-haired guy!

14:57.460 --> 14:59.040
<i>I'm not gonna make it!</i>

15:07.590 --> 15:08.930
His foot?!

15:09.680 --> 15:10.220
Amazing!

15:11.060 --> 15:12.140
Unbelievable!

15:12.140 --> 15:13.600
One more time!

15:14.020 --> 15:15.310
Nishinoya, nice save!

15:15.730 --> 15:17.770
<i>Get back! Get back immediately!</i>

15:18.810 --> 15:22.650
<i>Secure enough approach runway, and jump your highest!</i>

15:23.360 --> 15:25.740
<i>Do it as many times as it takes!</i>

15:26.070 --> 15:28.700
<i>Don't stop thinking! Don't stop moving!</i>

15:29.160 --> 15:31.910
<i>If you stop wanting it, the ball will hit the floor!</i>

15:32.660 --> 15:33.910
Kageyama, cover it!

15:33.910 --> 15:34.410
Right!

15:35.460 --> 15:36.620
One more time!

15:37.040 --> 15:38.080
One more time!

15:38.420 --> 15:39.840
Until I make the point!

15:42.420 --> 15:45.760
<i>Asahi's favorite set is placed slightly in front of the net.</i>

15:46.130 --> 15:47.470
A high set.

15:49.220 --> 15:51.680
What? What is Kageyama doing?

15:52.510 --> 15:53.600
It's all right.

15:54.770 --> 15:57.770
This is our best set.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.150
Go, Asahi!

16:02.150 --> 16:03.650
Blast through 'em, Asahi!

16:03.650 --> 16:07.530
Go!

16:48.320 --> 16:50.530
Date Tech                   Karasuno

16:48.320 --> 16:50.530
Date Tech                   Karasuno

16:59.040 --> 17:00.830
All right!

17:02.000 --> 17:04.090
We did it! We did it!

17:05.250 --> 17:06.800
We have to line up.

17:08.670 --> 17:10.760
Thank you for the match!

17:31.240 --> 17:32.700
You did it, Asahi!

17:32.700 --> 17:36.240
Asahi, Date Tech's block went boom!

17:36.240 --> 17:38.620
And then they went wobble-wobble!

17:38.620 --> 17:40.620
If it was me, I would've schwoomed!

17:40.620 --> 17:42.330
Are we even speaking the same language?

17:44.960 --> 17:46.630
If I'm the ace,

17:47.340 --> 17:49.010
you guys are the heroes.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.590
Ooh, heroes!

17:53.760 --> 17:55.430
I like the sound of that!

18:00.600 --> 18:04.730
You did good against that insane fast attack.

18:05.060 --> 18:05.520
Just chalk it—

18:05.520 --> 18:06.190
The spring!

18:06.610 --> 18:08.570
He's right, Moniwa!

18:08.570 --> 18:11.650
Let's take our revenge in the spring tourney prelims!

18:12.070 --> 18:13.780
The prelims start in September, right?!

18:13.780 --> 18:15.570
Let's get back home, formulate a plan of attack,

18:15.570 --> 18:18.330
and take down Karasuno if we hit them in the spring tourney prelims!

18:18.330 --> 18:20.870
The third-years won't stick around until the spring tournament.

18:22.290 --> 18:25.920
Why not?! Are we too much of a burden for you?!

18:25.920 --> 18:28.250
What're you talking about?

18:28.250 --> 18:30.010
We've discussed this many times.

18:30.010 --> 18:32.170
The third-years are done after the interhigh.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.510
But...

18:34.510 --> 18:36.600
You guys are tough.

18:36.600 --> 18:45.770
{=13}<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

18:36.600 --> 18:45.770
{=12}<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

18:37.350 --> 18:40.890
Our school is called a powerhouse,

18:40.890 --> 18:44.350
but us third-years have been called the odd ones out.

18:44.350 --> 18:45.770
We're the chaff.

18:45.770 --> 18:50.940
It's only thanks to you guys that we stayed a team that didn't dishonor the Iron Wall name.

18:52.110 --> 18:55.700
That's why when you guys are third-years, stay on until the spring tournament!

18:56.280 --> 18:59.280
Start prepping for it right now with a new team,

18:59.280 --> 19:02.080
and if you can't win this year's prelims, win next year!

19:02.080 --> 19:05.790
Take on Aoba Jousai and Shiratorizawa and Karasuno!

19:05.790 --> 19:08.170
Beat them all and go to nationals!

19:09.090 --> 19:09.710
But—

19:09.710 --> 19:10.500
Got it?!

19:12.920 --> 19:13.630
Yessir.

19:14.260 --> 19:16.640
We can't hear you, Futakuchi!

19:19.890 --> 19:20.850
Yessir!

19:22.390 --> 19:24.770
Sawamura, Sugawara, Azumane!

19:25.730 --> 19:27.480
Congrats on advancing to the third round!

19:27.810 --> 19:29.150
Michimiya!

19:29.150 --> 19:31.400
I thought I heard a lot of girls' voices.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.490
Didn't you notice them?

19:33.490 --> 19:34.820
Aya!

19:36.070 --> 19:37.910
You got your revenge.

19:43.450 --> 19:44.370
Yeah!

19:44.370 --> 19:45.870
And we'll keep on winning!

19:47.290 --> 19:49.170
Say, Ukai?

19:49.580 --> 19:51.250
About that last set.

19:51.250 --> 19:54.260
What did you mean when you said it was our best?

19:55.260 --> 19:59.590
When the receives are crazy and you can't attack the way you want to,

19:59.590 --> 20:04.140
the last ball always ends up on the left, where the ace is.

20:04.850 --> 20:07.980
In what they call the last bastion of the attack,

20:07.980 --> 20:13.110
I wanted him to experience how it feels to wrench a point out of that wall with his own two hands.

20:08.520 --> 20:12.520
Thank you!

20:13.570 --> 20:14.860
I get it.

20:14.860 --> 20:18.070
It leads to confidence for the next play.

20:18.700 --> 20:23.790
I heard it was bad for Azumane in particular after having his ass handed to him by Date Tech once before.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.410
But he should be all better now.

20:27.080 --> 20:30.540
He fought against the Iron Wall without flinching with or without a decoy.

20:31.380 --> 20:37.380
Besides, the act of having a set sent your way is a source of pride for a spiker.

20:38.130 --> 20:42.390
It's the greatest proof that you still have the trust of your setter.

20:43.760 --> 20:48.730
He has two setters trusting him with the set, so how could it not give him confidence?

20:50.600 --> 20:53.520
Date Tech's block was seriously terrifying.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.690
Yeah.

20:55.780 --> 21:02.200
Still, did you figure out how the Karasuno first-year duo differentiated their ridiculous fast attack?

21:02.620 --> 21:05.740
I didn't see any tell-tale signals during the rally.

21:08.370 --> 21:11.210
Our opponents didn't notice our signals, huh?

21:11.210 --> 21:14.130
Yeah. We're gonna get some use out of them.

21:14.130 --> 21:18.840
Yeah, it's a wonder you meat-heads thought those up.

21:18.840 --> 21:21.090
W-We didn't think them up.

21:21.090 --> 21:22.760
Thought as much.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.600
So, who came up with them for you?

21:25.350 --> 21:26.600
Sugawara.

21:28.730 --> 21:31.310
You did it. You got your revenge.

21:31.310 --> 21:32.100
Yeah.

21:33.810 --> 21:35.070
But of course,

21:36.440 --> 21:39.240
I would've liked to beat them with my own sets.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.490
Sorry! Let's keep that between us.

21:46.490 --> 21:47.370
That's a relief.

21:49.500 --> 21:53.000
I'm glad you haven't given up on playing yet.

21:54.460 --> 21:55.790
We've got another match tomorrow.

21:55.790 --> 21:56.880
We're gonna go as far as we can.

21:57.710 --> 21:58.380
Yeah.

22:00.220 --> 22:02.470
Ooh, Oikawa!

22:03.220 --> 22:04.970
Oikawa!

22:04.970 --> 22:07.510

Aoba Jousai

22:04.970 --> 22:07.510
Aoba Jousai

22:05.510 --> 22:10.140
Fight, Seijou! Work it, work it, Seijou! Go!

22:08.640 --> 22:10.140
Aoba Jousai's...

22:10.140 --> 22:11.480
...first win.

22:12.810 --> 22:15.400
Guess who's going to chew up and spit out king and dark horse alike...

22:17.190 --> 22:20.030
and make it to nationals?

22:24.240 --> 22:25.410
We are!
