00:22.340 --> 00:24.630
What are you up to?!

00:24.630 --> 00:26.050
I won't let you!

00:26.050 --> 00:27.470
Hinata, you're acting too scared!

00:27.470 --> 00:29.930
Shouyou, he's not up to anything!

00:29.930 --> 00:31.140
He's trying to smile! I think!

00:31.140 --> 00:33.430
I think it's rude, Nishinoya!

00:33.430 --> 00:34.760
Hinata, you're dead meat!

00:35.180 --> 00:36.720
<i>Ooh!</i>

00:36.720 --> 00:39.560
<i>Our grumpy Kageyama is making the effort to smile.</i>

00:40.770 --> 00:43.730
You know the signals we talked about? It's time to change our strategy.

00:44.190 --> 00:45.190
Thank you.

00:45.190 --> 00:47.610
Did you hear about the signals from Sugawara?

00:47.610 --> 00:49.070
He told me between sets.

00:52.160 --> 00:53.030
All right!

00:53.660 --> 00:54.780
We're going hard and fast.

00:55.490 --> 00:56.370
You got it!

00:57.040 --> 00:57.040
{OP}

01:01.670 --> 01:07.010
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

01:01.670 --> 01:07.010
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

01:11.680 --> 01:18.060
I take two deep breaths and calm my heart

01:18.310 --> 01:24.730
I take a step with my left foot to break the silence

01:25.440 --> 01:31.900
Get your nervousness in check and reign in your mind

01:32.240 --> 01:35.450
You have it in you

01:35.450 --> 01:38.290
You can cast out the demons

01:39.160 --> 01:45.420
Fate? Random chance? Questions? Answers? It's all one

01:45.420 --> 01:47.710
This is the sign

01:52.050 --> 01:53.890
Oh, yeah!

01:53.890 --> 01:56.510
The world is opening to us

01:56.510 --> 01:59.560
We pass the door,

01:59.560 --> 02:05.730
look straight ahead, and never look back

02:05.730 --> 02:07.650
Oh, yeah!

02:07.650 --> 02:13.360
I put my hand to my chest

02:13.360 --> 02:19.490
I can feel the proof that I exist

02:19.490 --> 02:23.620
It is my beating heart

02:27.000 --> 02:27.000
{Part A}

02:27.250 --> 02:29.960
Episode Twenty-two: 
Evolution

02:27.250 --> 02:29.960
Episode Twenty-two: 
Evolution

02:32.130 --> 02:34.380
Hey, it's not that unusual.

02:34.380 --> 02:36.550
That was really nerve-wracking.

02:36.550 --> 02:37.930
Really?

02:38.850 --> 02:45.400
Up till last year's interhigh, I didn't get to play in many official matches because third-years had seniority.

02:46.060 --> 02:49.900
I hate to say it, but Kageyama has more actual match experience.

02:50.530 --> 02:54.450
For all his so-called experience, he sure got riled up.

02:54.450 --> 02:58.320
So anyway, His Majesty has to serve straight off.

02:58.320 --> 03:00.200
You think he can manage?

03:00.200 --> 03:01.490
Give us a good serve, Kageyama!

03:01.490 --> 03:03.040
Serve up a point!

03:05.290 --> 03:07.170
Kageyama looks happy.

03:07.170 --> 03:08.210
Yeah.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.750
That's a relief.

03:10.750 --> 03:11.920
What do you mean?

03:12.630 --> 03:19.140
I was thinking that all of us seem to have the same sort of pride when we're put in a match.

03:19.720 --> 03:22.310
Prodigies and Average Joes alike.

03:23.430 --> 03:25.810
Kageyama, remember to relax!

03:28.810 --> 03:30.730
I think he's okay.

03:37.570 --> 03:39.120
One point and he's gone!

03:39.410 --> 03:40.580
Yeah!

03:47.580 --> 03:48.830
Watari!

03:51.460 --> 03:53.050
A service ace!

03:53.050 --> 03:54.260
And they got it off the libero!

03:54.260 --> 03:56.220
Karasuno                   Aoba Jousai

03:54.260 --> 03:56.220
Karasuno                   Aoba Jousai

03:54.590 --> 03:56.220
Now they're tied up!

03:56.550 --> 03:57.220
Yes!

03:57.720 --> 03:59.220
I'm sorry!

03:59.220 --> 04:01.300
Don't fret it. Let's get the next point!

04:01.300 --> 04:03.260
Yay!

04:05.100 --> 04:06.770
Yay!

04:07.230 --> 04:07.890
What?

04:08.640 --> 04:09.940
Double high five, you dummy!

04:11.190 --> 04:12.480
Yay!

04:13.070 --> 04:15.490
Kageyama is doing double high fives.

04:15.490 --> 04:16.440
Yeah.

04:23.330 --> 04:24.330
Sorry, cover it!

04:24.330 --> 04:24.910
Right!

04:25.410 --> 04:26.370
They're scattered!

04:26.370 --> 04:27.330
It's coming back!

04:28.500 --> 04:29.620
Here's our chance!

04:31.750 --> 04:32.710
<i>Send it?</i>

04:32.710 --> 04:33.670
<i>Give me?</i>

04:33.670 --> 04:34.630
<i>Which?</i>

04:36.800 --> 04:38.300
<i>He didn't say anything!</i>

04:38.590 --> 04:39.760
There it is!

04:39.760 --> 04:42.260
That fast attack is totally ridiculous!

04:42.260 --> 04:45.520
Okay! Now Karasuno is in the lead!

04:43.970 --> 04:45.930
Karasuno                   Aoba Jousai

04:43.970 --> 04:45.930
Karasuno                   Aoba Jousai

04:46.560 --> 04:50.390
When I make a ball count, 
Sugawara showers me with compliments!

04:51.520 --> 04:52.650
Hey, Hinata.

04:54.690 --> 04:55.530
Good work.

04:55.530 --> 04:56.650
Who are you, my boss?

04:57.900 --> 05:00.530
Now Hinata is in his element, dammit!

05:00.530 --> 05:03.780
And Kageyama is like a fish in water!

05:05.370 --> 05:06.450
<i>Kageyama?</i>

05:06.450 --> 05:07.330
<i>A fish?</i>

05:07.620 --> 05:08.450
Shit.

05:08.450 --> 05:10.790
Okay, calm down.

05:11.290 --> 05:14.500
There's no need to panic and 
mess up our plays like they did.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.340
Once we take a point back, we're all good.

05:18.260 --> 05:19.010
Yes, sir!

05:19.300 --> 05:21.970
Hey. Stop striking that pose.

05:21.970 --> 05:23.140
It pisses me off.

05:23.140 --> 05:24.220
You're mean!

05:28.180 --> 05:29.680
Okay!

05:29.680 --> 05:31.890
Iwaizumi, nice receive!

05:34.860 --> 05:38.150
<i>Has Kageyama gotten his rhythm back?</i>

05:35.190 --> 05:36.230
I'm sorry.

05:36.230 --> 05:36.980
Shake it off!

05:38.860 --> 05:40.780
<i>No, there's more to it.</i>

05:41.530 --> 05:43.910
I should've made it closer to the sideline.

05:41.530 --> 05:44.240
<i>He devoted his full attention to the opponent blockers before,</i>

05:43.910 --> 05:46.780
Don't sweat it! Those were all good serves.

05:44.240 --> 05:49.000
<i>but now he's being slightly more attentive to his teammates as well.</i>

05:47.620 --> 05:49.000
Thank you.

05:54.920 --> 05:57.630
<i>Okay, don't start holding back!</i>

05:57.630 --> 05:59.880
<i>We're screwed unless we take this set!</i>

06:00.550 --> 06:02.510
<i>Make those deviant fast attacks hard and fast!</i>

06:00.550 --> 06:02.010
Kunimi, give us a good one!

06:03.090 --> 06:04.090
Okay!

06:05.260 --> 06:06.550
Nice receive!

06:07.390 --> 06:11.770
<i>Kageyama told Hinata that "as long as I'm around, you're the greatest,"</i>

06:16.360 --> 06:17.320
<i>but it goes both ways.</i>

06:22.190 --> 06:23.950
<i>Your and Hinata's combined attack</i>

06:25.200 --> 06:26.620
<i>is the greatest.</i>

06:26.950 --> 06:29.580
Okay, we hit 20 points first!

06:29.580 --> 06:32.290
Karasuno                   Aoba Jousai

06:29.580 --> 06:32.290
Karasuno                   Aoba Jousai

06:30.040 --> 06:32.290
Now we're in the final stretch.

06:36.710 --> 06:39.170
<i>Okay, we've hit the 20 point mark.</i>

06:37.210 --> 06:38.540
That hurt!

06:38.540 --> 06:39.920
It's for motivation!

06:39.170 --> 06:43.880
<i>Here's where the real challenge starts.</i>

06:45.800 --> 06:48.720
Why is this turning into Tsukishima versus Kageyama?!

06:49.930 --> 06:50.810
One point!

06:50.810 --> 06:52.680
Hinata, give us a good one!

06:53.520 --> 06:54.140
It's over the net!

06:55.350 --> 06:56.150
Here's our chance!

06:56.150 --> 06:56.980
Mattsun, nice cover!

06:56.980 --> 06:57.610
Kageyama!

07:01.400 --> 07:02.690
Yes!

07:03.940 --> 07:04.900
How was the set?

07:04.900 --> 07:06.570
A little higher, please.

07:06.570 --> 07:07.280
Yes, sir!

07:07.280 --> 07:09.240
Karasuno                   Aoba Jousai

07:07.280 --> 07:09.240
Karasuno                   Aoba Jousai

07:09.830 --> 07:12.200
Seijou had to call for a timeout sometime.

07:17.170 --> 07:20.710
When number ten goes back and 
number eleven comes to the front row,

07:20.710 --> 07:23.090
Karasuno does less center attacks.

07:23.090 --> 07:24.090
Yeah.

07:24.090 --> 07:27.640
It could simply be that Tobio doesn't like the beanpole.

07:28.800 --> 07:33.600
Just like in yesterday's match, they don't seem to be communicating in today's match.

07:33.600 --> 07:39.110
I think that among all of Karasuno's spikers,
 Tobio finds the beanpole the hardest to work with.

07:39.730 --> 07:42.440
Now I know I never want to be friends with you.

07:42.440 --> 07:43.530
How come?!

07:43.530 --> 07:45.400
You'd ferret out my weaknesses.

07:45.400 --> 07:48.110
Why would I want to learn the weakness of a teammate?!

07:49.530 --> 07:53.990
<i>I think he talks to each spiker to read their faces and emotional states more</i>

07:51.080 --> 07:55.450
Tsukishima, I think you might be jumping to block too soon. Delay it more.

07:53.990 --> 07:57.670
<i>and to get a bearing on how well they feel on a given day.</i>

07:55.450 --> 07:56.330
Understood.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.870
Yamaguchi, keep yelling things out!

07:58.870 --> 07:59.540
Right!

08:00.040 --> 08:00.920
What?

08:02.880 --> 08:05.010
<i>How am I supposed to read his face?</i>

08:05.010 --> 08:07.840
<i>All I know is that his face pisses me off!</i>

08:07.840 --> 08:08.720
Kageyama.

08:09.260 --> 08:11.470
Start with a conversation.

08:11.470 --> 08:12.680
With a guy like Tsukishima,

08:13.390 --> 08:15.390
you need direct communication.

08:17.440 --> 08:18.480
Yes, sir.

08:24.190 --> 08:24.900
I've got it!

08:30.070 --> 08:32.240
They retrieved it! Look out for the counter!

08:30.360 --> 08:31.740
Nice receive!

08:32.700 --> 08:35.700
Tsukishima seems to be having trouble hitting it.

08:38.370 --> 08:39.670
They caught up to us!

08:39.670 --> 08:41.250
Shit, we're tied!

08:41.250 --> 08:42.080
They scored!

08:42.080 --> 08:43.340
Yeah.

08:43.710 --> 08:44.420
Sir!

08:44.420 --> 08:45.590
Right!

08:47.170 --> 08:48.340
All right!

08:48.340 --> 08:50.760
Do they need a stronger offense?

08:51.510 --> 08:55.470
Karasuno has it rough without 
their number ten in this situation.

08:55.720 --> 08:57.560
Come on, guys!

08:57.560 --> 08:58.930
You look too tense!

09:00.140 --> 09:01.400
Stay calm!

09:01.400 --> 09:02.350
You're moving well!

09:02.350 --> 09:03.610
Yessir.

09:04.770 --> 09:05.480
Hey.

09:07.610 --> 09:09.990
How was that last set for you? Eh?

09:11.910 --> 09:13.990
Why are you talking like Tanaka?

09:13.990 --> 09:15.410
What's that? Eh?

09:17.910 --> 09:21.960
It pisses me off 'cause it's like being told,
 "Shut up and hit it, you pleb."

09:21.960 --> 09:22.710
Huh?!

09:23.000 --> 09:24.460
<i>There you go again, Tsukishima!</i>

09:24.460 --> 09:25.960
<i>You're such a child!</i>

09:25.960 --> 09:28.170
<i>There's no time to bicker like that!</i>

09:28.550 --> 09:29.760
What do you mean?

09:32.970 --> 09:36.760
I have my own way of doing things, so I want sets to be consistent.

09:38.430 --> 09:40.560
Um, what's going on?

09:40.560 --> 09:47.110
My best guess is that when Kageyama sets a quick attack for Tsukishima, he also signals where the ball should go.

09:47.440 --> 09:53.660
m 0 0 l 150 0 150 150 0 150

09:47.440 --> 09:53.660
<b>Cross</b>

09:47.940 --> 09:51.240
A set near the setter means cross-court.

09:51.240 --> 09:53.660
Away from the setter means turn-swing.

09:51.950 --> 09:53.660
m 0 0 l 150 0 150 150 0 150

09:51.950 --> 09:53.660
<b>Turn</b>

09:54.240 --> 09:58.120
Kageyama obviously places it where he thinks it would be easiest to hit.

09:58.740 --> 10:02.370
However, Tsukishima probably
 finds it hard to hit sets like that.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.330
You're not the only one who's thinking about stuff.

10:06.090 --> 10:10.210
Whether it's the opponent's defense formation or the attacks that work for us that day,

10:10.760 --> 10:12.800
everyone is always thinking.

10:13.340 --> 10:16.100
Even Hinata thinks occasionally.

10:16.100 --> 10:19.140
That's how he learned how to do regular fast attacks.

10:19.140 --> 10:20.520
Barely, anyway.

10:20.520 --> 10:21.890
What do you mean, "even"?

10:21.890 --> 10:23.390
What do you mean, "barely"?!

10:23.390 --> 10:24.400
There, there.

10:24.730 --> 10:25.650
Understood.

10:26.610 --> 10:28.730
You're awfully compliant today.

10:28.730 --> 10:29.860
Are you feeling okay?

10:30.320 --> 10:33.110
You never know what works until you try it.

10:38.410 --> 10:44.160
<i>Tsukishima probably isn't used to dealing with anyone with a head-on approach, so he's stuck listening.</i>

10:41.290 --> 10:43.830
Okay! We're taking this set!

10:43.830 --> 10:44.750
Yeah!

10:47.250 --> 10:48.630
Nice, Noya!

10:49.840 --> 10:53.920
I have my own way of doing things, so I want sets to be consistent.

11:00.350 --> 11:01.180
<i>A diversion?</i>

11:02.680 --> 11:04.230
Right on!

11:04.230 --> 11:06.190
It landed in the empty zone right behind the blockers!

11:06.190 --> 11:07.610
He did it!

11:07.980 --> 11:09.940
<i>God, he pisses me off!</i>

11:10.570 --> 11:13.530
I thought he was gonna smash it at the last second.

11:11.230 --> 11:12.530
Nice!

11:13.530 --> 11:17.110
Tsukishima seems to glow when he gets the ball past an opponent!

11:17.110 --> 11:18.490
Glow?

11:18.490 --> 11:21.580
It's hard to tell, but that's how he looks when he's really into the match.

11:21.580 --> 11:22.540
Ooh!

11:24.790 --> 11:25.540
Here's our chance!

11:28.250 --> 11:29.380
<i>Another diversion!</i>

11:30.920 --> 11:32.340
Nice, Watari!

11:32.340 --> 11:33.130
It's coming back!

11:33.460 --> 11:35.340
Number eleven is really good at that.

11:33.760 --> 11:34.760
We have another chance!

11:35.340 --> 11:40.260
But isn't he avoiding direct confrontation with Seijou's high blockers?

11:40.260 --> 11:43.100
Diversions allow him to avoid dealing with it.

11:43.100 --> 11:46.060
So isn't number eleven actually avoiding the blockers?

11:48.350 --> 11:50.310
Yes!

11:52.940 --> 11:54.230
Nice, Mattsun!

11:54.900 --> 11:57.660
<i>Crap. They took a point right back like it was nothing.</i>

11:57.660 --> 12:00.120
Karasuno                   Aoba Jousai

11:57.660 --> 12:00.120
Karasuno                   Aoba Jousai

11:58.610 --> 12:00.120
Number eleven down the center!

12:01.990 --> 12:02.950
<i>Again?</i>

12:02.950 --> 12:04.830
<i>Okay, I can dig it out this time!</i>

12:05.580 --> 12:07.620
Nice receive, Watari!

12:07.620 --> 12:08.620
I got it!

12:08.620 --> 12:09.830
Center!

12:13.300 --> 12:14.760
Tanaka, nice receive!

12:14.760 --> 12:16.220
Shit!

12:16.220 --> 12:18.180
Tread carefully!

12:16.840 --> 12:19.180
Sorry, it's too low! Cover it for me!

12:18.180 --> 12:20.180
This is the one they have to get.

12:20.470 --> 12:21.890
Will the ace take it?

12:25.810 --> 12:28.020
<i>Everyone is always thinking.</i>

12:30.440 --> 12:31.900
<i>Number eleven again!</i>

12:32.400 --> 12:34.270
No! Hold your positions!

12:38.240 --> 12:40.200
Ooh!

12:40.200 --> 12:41.910
All right!

12:41.910 --> 12:43.660
You really piss me off, you bastard!

12:43.660 --> 12:44.950
You thug!

12:45.910 --> 12:50.330
We were watching so hard for a diversion, our defense pressed too far forward.

12:46.910 --> 12:48.120
That hurts.

12:49.620 --> 12:50.580
I'm sorry!

12:50.330 --> 12:51.670
They got us.

12:50.580 --> 12:51.670
Okay, let's get the next one!

12:53.290 --> 12:55.880
N... Ni... Nice.

12:57.550 --> 12:59.680
Don't choke on it, Kageyama!

12:59.680 --> 13:03.180
Whoa, Kageyama gave Tsukishima a compliment!

13:04.600 --> 13:07.680
<i>Kageyama is definitely starting to change.</i>

13:07.680 --> 13:10.690
How bad at compliments can you be?!

13:12.100 --> 13:15.320
Karasuno                   Aoba Jousai

13:12.100 --> 13:15.320
Karasuno                   Aoba Jousai

13:12.440 --> 13:14.400
It's set point for Karasuno!

13:14.400 --> 13:15.320
Get out!

13:15.650 --> 13:16.730
One point to go!

13:16.730 --> 13:17.780
One more point!

13:22.610 --> 13:24.030
No, you don't!

13:24.030 --> 13:28.750
Karasuno                   Aoba Jousai

13:24.030 --> 13:28.750
Karasuno                   Aoba Jousai

13:27.620 --> 13:28.750
It's okay!

13:29.040 --> 13:30.290
One point!

13:30.290 --> 13:34.210
Get one more point like all the other points, 
and you can take this set!

14:33.060 --> 14:35.400

14:35.940 --> 14:38.110

<i>Shiratorizawa Junior High, who became known as the best in the prefecture,</i>

14:53.120 --> 14:55.870

14:58.210 --> 15:00.090

15:01.090 --> 15:03.340
<i>We played against them and lost.</i>

15:03.340 --> 15:05.220
<i>We didn't even take one set.</i>

15:06.180 --> 15:07.800
<i>We wanted to keep going.</i>

15:07.800 --> 15:09.850

15:09.850 --> 15:13.640

15:13.640 --> 15:14.350
<i>And that time...</i>

15:15.230 --> 15:18.520
My name is Kageyama Tobio, 
and I went to Akiyama Elementary School.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.440
I've been playing volleyball since second grade.

15:20.440 --> 15:22.110
It's a pleasure to meet you!

15:23.110 --> 15:25.900
<i>A prodigy appeared to take our place.</i>

15:25.900 --> 15:29.070
<i>His skill was overwhelmingly obvious.</i>

15:30.200 --> 15:34.580
<i>The way he looked overjoyed to be playing the sport...</i>

15:35.080 --> 15:40.210
<i>combined with the way he was used to handling a ball was far above the rest.</i>

15:40.790 --> 15:45.720
Basically, he can do all kinds of positions, but he'll eventually be a setter.

15:45.720 --> 15:46.510
Yes.

15:47.430 --> 15:51.510
<i>After that, Oikawa started to practice even harder than before.</i>

15:53.560 --> 15:55.230
You're working too hard!

15:55.770 --> 15:58.400
Coach warned you about that just yesterday!

16:01.150 --> 16:03.780
It's all for nothing if you get injured, moron!

16:03.780 --> 16:05.440
C'mon, you're done! Stretch!

16:06.070 --> 16:08.660
<i>He was completely losing his cool.</i>

16:08.990 --> 16:14.620
<i>His lack of composure showed in a practice match in the form of several unimaginable setting mistakes.</i>

16:15.750 --> 16:16.620
<i>And then...</i>

16:20.080 --> 16:21.420
Kageyama, get in there.

16:21.420 --> 16:22.090
Yes, sir!

16:22.670 --> 16:23.670
Okay.

16:26.010 --> 16:27.050
Forward!

16:27.050 --> 16:27.880
I've got it!

16:29.470 --> 16:30.510
Nice cover!

16:31.140 --> 16:32.640

16:32.640 --> 16:33.760

16:44.730 --> 16:45.690
Oikawa?

16:47.530 --> 16:49.400
Please teach me how to serve.

16:56.620 --> 16:57.500
<i>Get away from me.</i>

16:58.750 --> 16:59.960
<i>Get away from me.</i>

17:01.040 --> 17:02.420
<i>Get away from me.</i>

17:02.830 --> 17:06.590
<i>Don't come near me!</i>

17:10.050 --> 17:12.300
Get a grip, you moron!

17:15.680 --> 17:16.970
I'm sorry.

17:16.970 --> 17:19.980
Kageyama, I'm sorry, but we're done for the day.

17:19.980 --> 17:21.270
Um, sure.

17:26.980 --> 17:31.280
We swapped you out today to give you the chance to get it together.

17:31.280 --> 17:32.950
Give yourself some credit!

17:35.200 --> 17:40.080
How can I possibly give myself credit if I'm not good enough to beat Shiratorizawa?!

17:40.080 --> 17:42.500
I want to win and go to nationals!

17:42.500 --> 17:44.840
To win, I have to work harder!

17:44.840 --> 17:48.170
It's all "me, me, me"! Just shut up!

17:50.510 --> 17:53.050
Do you think you're playing all by yourself?!

17:53.050 --> 17:55.220
That's not even funny, moron!

17:55.220 --> 17:59.980
If you believe that your performance equals team performance, I'm gonna belt you one!

17:59.980 --> 18:01.230
You already did.

18:01.560 --> 18:05.230
No one in our team can take on Ushiwaka one on one!

18:05.980 --> 18:09.860
But there are six people on a volleyball court!

18:11.070 --> 18:14.570
I don't care if we're against a
 first-year prodigy or Ushiwaka!

18:14.570 --> 18:17.580
The team with the best six players is obviously the best, moron!

18:20.370 --> 18:23.000
The team with the best six players is the best?

18:25.540 --> 18:29.130
I'm sorry. Did I headbutt you too hard?

18:30.630 --> 18:31.800
Yeah.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.510
It's like, I can't even describe this.

18:35.220 --> 18:37.220
I just suddenly feel invincible.

18:37.680 --> 18:41.020
Wait, Iwa. Is "moron" the only bad name you can call me?

18:41.020 --> 18:43.560
You wanna bleed from your other nostril too?

18:46.150 --> 18:47.230
Nice location!

18:47.810 --> 18:48.900
One more point!

18:49.520 --> 18:53.820
I'm surprised. Oikawa looks like he's over it.

18:53.820 --> 18:54.860
Yes.

18:54.860 --> 18:57.280
Oikawa, please teach me how to toss the ball up before a serve.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.490
I don't think so, you dum-dum!

18:59.490 --> 19:02.290

This award is the proof that our spikers did their very best.

19:23.270 --> 19:27.230
Doesn't that mean Ushiwaka is even better?

19:27.230 --> 19:28.060
Dammit.

19:29.150 --> 19:30.400
When I get to high school...

19:31.270 --> 19:35.650
I'm gonna humiliate Shiratorizawa instead!

19:36.490 --> 19:37.740
That's a given!

19:38.320 --> 19:40.280
And then there's you, Tobio!

19:40.950 --> 19:47.500
I don't know where you'll move on to next, 
but when I do play against you, prepare to get creamed!

19:47.790 --> 19:50.090
Big talk for someone who needs to wipe his nose.

19:50.090 --> 19:51.630
Would you like a tissue?

19:51.630 --> 19:52.710
Shut up!

19:52.710 --> 19:57.800
Go for it! Go, go, go, go, Seijou!

19:57.800 --> 19:58.550
Okay, bring it!

19:58.550 --> 19:59.220
Let's do it!

19:59.220 --> 19:59.930
Give us a good one!

20:00.470 --> 20:02.640
Now it's Oikawa's turn to serve.

20:03.970 --> 20:07.520
You're facing the guy who's second on your humiliation list!

20:10.190 --> 20:11.730
Give it all you've got.

20:12.940 --> 20:14.360
I know.

20:15.610 --> 20:19.030
Olé!

20:21.200 --> 20:22.870
Nishinoya!

20:24.830 --> 20:26.160
It's up!

20:26.790 --> 20:29.750
But it's heading right back to Seijou!

20:30.380 --> 20:34.210
<i>One mistake and that serve could've cost them the set! What a serve!</i>

20:34.550 --> 20:36.170
<i>This dude is amazing!</i>

20:36.170 --> 20:37.260
Here's our chance!

20:39.430 --> 20:41.890
<i>The receive neatly came back to the setter.</i>

20:41.890 --> 20:43.260
<i>It has a high rate of success</i>

20:43.890 --> 20:45.470
<i>due to fast attacks from the center!</i>

20:47.770 --> 20:48.940
<i>That must be it.</i>

20:48.940 --> 20:50.690
<i>That's what I would do.</i>

20:50.690 --> 20:54.440
<i>Now that his back is against the wall...</i>

20:56.150 --> 20:57.650
<i>Oikawa will set it to Iwaizumi!</i>

21:09.160 --> 21:11.630
All right!

21:11.630 --> 21:15.590
Karasuno                       Aoba Jousai

21:12.040 --> 21:13.250
For real?

21:13.250 --> 21:15.590
Karasuno took back a set.

21:15.590 --> 21:17.670
That piece of shit! I'm sorry!

21:17.670 --> 21:18.720
Shake it off.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.340
Why are you laughing?!

21:20.340 --> 21:21.430
I'll clobber you!

21:21.430 --> 21:24.600
Stop saying you're going to punch me, Iwa.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.100
Relax.

21:26.100 --> 21:28.480
You're the only one I threaten, and I won't hit you!

21:29.980 --> 21:34.270
That last fast attack from the center was one of our better attacks.

21:34.770 --> 21:35.980
Huh?

21:35.980 --> 21:37.980
I think Tobio must've predicted

21:37.980 --> 21:42.740
Good boy! Good boy!

21:38.650 --> 21:40.610
that I would set it to the left.

21:41.280 --> 21:42.740
Do you understand what this means?

21:43.530 --> 21:46.490
He wasn't thinking mechanically like he's always done.

21:46.490 --> 21:49.250
He saw that we were on the back foot toward the end...

21:49.910 --> 21:52.460
along with our relationship of absolute mutual trust.

21:52.460 --> 21:54.420
We have no such thing.

21:54.710 --> 21:58.300
Which means he made a comprehensive judgment call.

21:59.630 --> 22:04.800
What did Mr. Pleasant over there teach Tobio?

22:05.430 --> 22:10.020
A king who's nothing but a dictator is trying to become a decent king.

22:10.890 --> 22:12.190
What is this?

22:12.850 --> 22:16.230
How can I feel this way while I feel so incredibly irritated?!

22:20.110 --> 22:21.610
Now!

22:21.610 --> 22:24.860
I want to play the last set now!
