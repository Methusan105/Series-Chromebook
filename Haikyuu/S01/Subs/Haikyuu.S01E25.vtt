01:50.260 --> 01:56.680
I take a step with my left foot to break the silence

02:39.600 --> 02:45.310
I put my hand to my chest

02:45.310 --> 02:51.440

03:12.170 --> 03:13.630
Shiratorizawa!

03:13.630 --> 03:18.090
Get ready, because this is the day 
I humiliate you, my dear little Ushiwaka.

03:19.010 --> 03:21.470
Don't call me that, Oikawa.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.070
I'm starving!

03:32.070 --> 03:33.280
Let's hit the school shop.

03:33.940 --> 03:35.650
Hinata, let's eat.

03:39.200 --> 03:42.830
Right. Come to think of it,
 I heard you came close yesterday.

03:43.240 --> 03:46.080
Our team also lost in the third round last week.

03:46.080 --> 03:48.880
The guys who beat us ended up going to nationals.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.590
What's wrong? Aren't you hungry?

03:52.590 --> 03:53.550
Bathroom.

03:59.430 --> 04:03.100
The very first day Hinata and Kageyama came to practice,

04:03.100 --> 04:05.430
Daichi said we'd go to spring nationals.

04:07.350 --> 04:11.310
I forget, is the first qualifying round for that in August?

04:11.310 --> 04:13.900
He said we'd be going there one more time.

04:15.070 --> 04:17.070
There's no time to wallow in defeat.

04:19.610 --> 04:23.370
I'm thinking now would be a good time to retire.

04:26.580 --> 04:29.670
Ever since third-years could take part in the spring tournament,

04:29.670 --> 04:34.380
I've wanted us to survive the elimination and go to Tokyo to play in it.

04:35.710 --> 04:38.970
But seeing the first and second-years in action

04:39.300 --> 04:43.220
got me thinking it would be better to surrender the team to them sooner than later.

04:46.140 --> 04:50.600
It would be better for the team to have it restructured around them,

04:51.270 --> 04:52.440
the guys who show such promiseâ€”

04:52.440 --> 04:54.940
Daichi, is that what you really want?

04:57.320 --> 05:00.820
I know that being captain puts you in a position of responsibility,

05:00.820 --> 05:03.240
but I don't think you need to remove yourself entirely.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.830
If that was always your plan, I won't complain.

05:06.830 --> 05:10.670
Otherwise, you should play it out the way you want to.

05:13.920 --> 05:16.050
I'm staying on, just as I said I would!

05:16.050 --> 05:19.380
I'll only consider leaving if and when
 the younger members ask me to leave!

05:19.880 --> 05:21.720
With or without you two!

05:21.720 --> 05:24.350
But I told you I was staying on yesterday!

05:24.970 --> 05:27.350
I'm not going to college anyway.

05:27.350 --> 05:31.850
If the younger members asked me to leave, I'd take it hard.

05:31.850 --> 05:32.850
I...

05:34.560 --> 05:37.980
I still want to play too, you know!

05:38.360 --> 05:41.030
I still want to play volleyball with you guys!

05:52.830 --> 05:54.380
Mr. Takeda?

05:55.330 --> 05:57.750
Might we have a word regarding the volleyball team?

05:58.710 --> 05:59.550
Sure.

06:58.310 --> 07:00.650
So you got to play in a match, huh?

07:01.530 --> 07:02.570
How'd you like it?

07:03.530 --> 07:05.570
Did you have fun, Tadashi?

07:08.450 --> 07:09.370
No.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.040
No!

07:15.080 --> 07:16.000
I thought so.

07:16.830 --> 07:19.630
You tense up and can't move the way you want to.

07:19.630 --> 07:21.460
The ball won't fly right.

07:21.460 --> 07:23.380
There's nothing fun about that.

07:25.800 --> 07:30.810
Up until junior high, I played volleyball thinking it was a fun sort of thing to do with my friends.

07:31.470 --> 07:33.680
That's all it was to me.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.480
But it's nothing like that.

07:36.480 --> 07:37.980
It's different.

07:38.770 --> 07:41.520
I can't do what they do.

07:44.900 --> 07:46.530
I want full control of my body!

07:47.450 --> 07:49.200
I want to control the ball!

07:49.200 --> 07:51.990
I want to play as equals against good players!

07:55.080 --> 07:58.750
"To truly enjoy playing sports, you need to be strong."

08:01.710 --> 08:02.840
Coach Ukai...

08:03.250 --> 08:04.880
The older one, I mean.

08:04.880 --> 08:07.470
That's what he used to say to me.

08:07.470 --> 08:11.550
Needless to say, I wasn't the ace, and I wasn't a starter.

08:11.550 --> 08:15.310
Practicing was hard, and there were times I felt like quitting.

08:16.480 --> 08:17.520
But...

08:21.900 --> 08:25.740
When I nailed a service ace for the first time in a real match, it finally clicked.

08:26.360 --> 08:32.160
Hey, this is the play I've practiced so long for.

08:32.490 --> 08:35.370
That's when I decided that I would buckle down and practice hard,

08:35.370 --> 08:40.290
just to experience this one match, point, and moment all over again.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.800
Okay, let's get started!

08:48.220 --> 08:51.180
There isn't much time until the next match.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.600
Tsukki, let's eat!

08:57.600 --> 08:59.440
Yamaguchi, you're annoying.

09:01.190 --> 09:02.980
Sorry, Tsukki!

09:02.980 --> 09:04.020
Tsukki!

09:05.070 --> 09:07.490
Faculty Office

09:06.820 --> 09:10.150
Both Sugawara and Sawamura gave me advance notice

09:10.150 --> 09:13.950
they would be staying on the team past the interhigh despite their plans to go to college.

09:14.530 --> 09:16.160
And in Sugawara's case...

09:18.040 --> 09:19.040
Excuse me.

09:21.620 --> 09:22.880
Sugawara.

09:23.630 --> 09:27.250
I understand how you feel, 
but you really should focus on your studies.

09:27.670 --> 09:32.010
I honestly don't think you have anything to gain by staying on the team.

09:32.800 --> 09:38.060
I don't play volleyball because there's something to gain, sir.

09:38.720 --> 09:42.940
Sugawara isn't in the starting lineup for matches, is that correct?

09:42.940 --> 09:44.560
Y-Yes.

09:44.560 --> 09:47.440
He doesn't have much hope for a sports scholarship either.

09:47.440 --> 09:52.860
Both boys get excellent grades, but the question is can they maintain those grades?

09:53.610 --> 09:56.200
Would you please speak to the third-years?

09:56.200 --> 10:00.580
Be sure to address their futures rather than their current emotional state.

10:01.160 --> 10:05.040
Don't let them use what an adult told them as an excuse.

10:08.840 --> 10:09.590
I bet...

10:10.710 --> 10:11.670
What's up?

10:12.050 --> 10:15.140
I'll bet they're feeling lousy.

10:15.850 --> 10:18.720
I gave them the morning and afternoon off.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.600
It hasn't even been a day yet.

10:27.440 --> 10:30.280
Aoba Jousai sure was tough.

10:30.860 --> 10:33.650
They were tough. Really tough.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.200
We played well this time around,

10:37.200 --> 10:42.330
but who knows if we'll put up that good of a fight the next time we play them.

10:43.040 --> 10:46.920
Seijou will undoubtedly come at us again with the same consistent force.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.380
Did you see them during their timeouts?

10:50.380 --> 10:51.170
Yeah.

10:51.670 --> 10:54.760
It was mainly player-only meetings.

10:55.090 --> 10:57.760
Their coaches kept watch from the background.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.220
I'm sure they offered a few helpful words, of course.

11:02.980 --> 11:07.610
Their players are always thinking and adapting to every situation within the match.

11:08.230 --> 11:12.740
No matter what projectile weapon we bring out, they always combat it, calm and efficient.

11:12.740 --> 11:16.030
Whatever we did, they just refused to fall apart.

11:16.030 --> 11:17.780
It was really stressful.

11:18.450 --> 11:25.500
The only team capable of prying the points away from a carefully orchestrated powerhouse like Seijou...

11:33.420 --> 11:35.880
has to be Shiratorizawa.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.340
Unstoppable Force

11:38.720 --> 11:42.720
All the practicing and strategizing we've done, 
and the experience we have,

11:42.720 --> 11:45.350
is being torn apart by sheer brute force.

11:46.020 --> 11:50.310
Not like it matters how you win, really.

11:51.230 --> 11:54.690
Whoever lets the ball touch the ground loses.

11:55.990 --> 11:57.610
That's all that matters.

12:39.110 --> 12:39.150
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:39.150 --> 12:39.200
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:39.200 --> 12:39.240
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:39.200 --> 12:39.240
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:39.240 --> 12:39.280
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:39.240 --> 12:39.280
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:39.280 --> 12:39.320
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:39.280 --> 12:39.320
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:39.320 --> 12:46.000
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:39.320 --> 12:46.000
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:46.120 --> 12:46.160
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:46.160 --> 12:46.200
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:46.200 --> 12:46.250
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:46.200 --> 12:46.250
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:46.250 --> 12:46.290
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:46.250 --> 12:46.290
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:46.290 --> 12:46.330
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:46.290 --> 12:46.330
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:46.330 --> 12:53.000
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:46.330 --> 12:53.000
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

13:11.440 --> 13:17.740
If you were afflicted with an injury that could 
jeopardize your future if it wasn't allowed to heal,

13:17.740 --> 13:23.200
yet you still wanted to play for the only reason that
 you could never play again, I would have to stop you.

13:23.200 --> 13:26.790
Certain things must never be acted upon during an emotional time.

13:26.790 --> 13:33.000
But if it's something you can challenge yourselves to do many times, I believe that gives you options.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.170
Obviously, the possibility of failing 
your exams is not to be taken lightly.

13:37.920 --> 13:43.340
Overcoming obstacles requires the
 appropriate effort, patience, and sacrifice.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.510
The time you spend on your extracurricular activities

13:46.510 --> 13:51.270
is time that the other students will spend studying and working for the future.

13:51.270 --> 13:53.850
This will most definitely create a disparity.

13:54.520 --> 13:58.150
One day, you may regret that disparity deeply.

14:00.570 --> 14:02.110
Please think it over and choose.

14:02.570 --> 14:06.990
Choose the option you won't regret five or ten years from now.

14:26.430 --> 14:27.930
Squat lower.

14:28.760 --> 14:29.560
Right.

14:34.100 --> 14:36.980
The finals will be wrapping up by now.

14:39.440 --> 14:40.150
Yeah.

14:41.280 --> 14:44.530
The winners advance to nationals.

14:44.530 --> 14:46.870
The winners get to play lots of matches.

14:49.410 --> 14:50.330
Yeah.

14:53.460 --> 14:57.840
Goddammit!

15:01.670 --> 15:06.640
Goddammit!

15:15.770 --> 15:16.810
Shit.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.400
You shit!

16:10.530 --> 16:12.030
I wanna win.

16:14.120 --> 16:17.580
I will never apologize again.

16:19.960 --> 16:22.290
I will never make a set I need to apologize for...

16:23.630 --> 16:24.800
ever again!

16:32.680 --> 16:34.640
Only the strong...

16:35.930 --> 16:37.560
...get to stay on the court.

16:43.900 --> 16:45.230
There's no time.

16:47.530 --> 16:50.110
There's no time to stand still!

16:53.990 --> 16:56.120
But you have to eat your lunch.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.750
Uh...

16:59.040 --> 17:00.460
Shimizu?!

17:01.120 --> 17:05.340
And try not to scream so much. 
I heard you all the way from the clubroom.

17:05.340 --> 17:06.710
Y-You...

17:06.710 --> 17:09.050
Kiyoko!

17:10.220 --> 17:12.470
Kiyoko, you look lovely today.

17:12.470 --> 17:14.680
I crossed the seven seas to come see you!

17:15.390 --> 17:19.230
We'll faithfully follow you for life!

17:21.940 --> 17:23.690
Don't hurt yourselves.

17:23.690 --> 17:26.020
Aren't we supposed to have today off?

17:27.230 --> 17:29.320
Then explain what you guys are doing here.

17:29.320 --> 17:30.610
Afternoon!

17:34.320 --> 17:35.490
Hello.

17:36.330 --> 17:37.870
Now all we need are the third-years.

17:38.870 --> 17:41.750
But we didn't even have practice scheduled for today.

17:41.750 --> 17:43.170
Hey, hey, hey!

17:43.500 --> 17:46.040
You know the third-years would never retire!

17:46.040 --> 17:48.300
Huh? What do you mean?

17:48.300 --> 17:49.130
No way.

17:49.510 --> 17:52.590
The third-years are staying on the team, right?!

17:52.590 --> 17:55.510
They're taking part in the spring tournament, aren't they?!

18:02.140 --> 18:03.520
Crap. Hurry!

18:04.940 --> 18:05.440
That's right.

18:07.190 --> 18:08.190
They still are.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.400
You're late!

18:14.160 --> 18:15.870
Let's go to spring nationals!

18:18.950 --> 18:21.870
All right!

18:24.920 --> 18:26.750
<i>Here I am, at the school.</i>

18:27.040 --> 18:29.630
<i>I wonder if any crazy bastards have shown up?</i>

18:35.970 --> 18:37.930
Nice spike!

18:38.890 --> 18:40.100
Nice spike!

18:45.020 --> 18:46.690
Afternoon, sir!

18:47.770 --> 18:50.280
Why, you guys are doing fine.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.780
Please coach us once again!

18:54.780 --> 18:56.780
Thank you!

19:00.540 --> 19:03.790
We lost in a match to determine the superior team.

19:03.790 --> 19:05.750
Seijou was tough.

19:05.750 --> 19:07.960
We were inferior to them.

19:07.960 --> 19:10.710
That's the current resultâ€”the reality.

19:12.630 --> 19:15.380
So, the winner of today's interhigh prelims final...

19:16.130 --> 19:17.300
was...

19:21.770 --> 19:23.350
Shiratorizawa.

19:23.350 --> 19:25.810
Shiratorizawa                Aoba Jousai

19:23.350 --> 19:25.810
Shiratorizawa                Aoba Jousai

19:26.190 --> 19:27.350
Seijou...

19:28.230 --> 19:29.270
...lost?

19:34.990 --> 19:38.200
There's a team that beats Seijou within our own prefecture.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.030
We have to be stronger.

19:40.030 --> 19:42.660
I'm sure you already know our next objective.

19:43.830 --> 19:45.040
Spring nationals.

19:45.040 --> 19:49.130
Obviously, this will be the final match for the third-years.

19:50.210 --> 19:51.210
<i>Spring nationals.</i>

19:52.000 --> 19:53.920
<i>The place where the Little Giant went!</i>

19:54.710 --> 19:59.010
Okay, now let's have a word of motivation from your captain.

20:03.520 --> 20:06.390
It's the venue Karasuno has only been to once.

20:07.270 --> 20:09.810
The Orange Court in Tokyo!

20:11.520 --> 20:13.980
And we're going there once again!

20:20.320 --> 20:23.700
All right!

20:39.510 --> 20:40.890
Take five!

20:40.890 --> 20:42.100
Yessir!

21:11.120 --> 21:12.080
Kageyama.

21:14.340 --> 21:16.090
We're going to win this time.

21:18.340 --> 21:20.760
You and me and all of us!

21:23.720 --> 21:24.470
Right.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.560
Okay, break time's over!

21:27.560 --> 21:28.680
Yessir!

21:37.030 --> 21:40.650
<i>A massive, massive wall stands 
in front of me, blocking my way.</i>

21:41.240 --> 21:42.820
Time for spike practice!

21:42.820 --> 21:44.530
Yessir!

21:44.910 --> 21:46.490
Here goes!

21:48.120 --> 21:54.460
<i>The view on the other side is something I'll never be able to see alone.</i>

21:59.880 --> 22:01.260
Next! Hinata!

22:01.680 --> 22:02.930
I'm ready!

22:09.220 --> 22:11.810
Send it my way!

22:16.940 --> 22:21.030
<i>That's the view from the summit.</i>

22:26.990 --> 22:26.990
{ED}

22:33.160 --> 22:38.750
We run laps convinced that we will all make it

22:38.750 --> 22:44.680
We suffer through the nights for a vision we chose on a whim

22:38.750 --> 22:44.680
We suffer through the nights for a vision we chose on a whim

22:45.010 --> 22:50.600
If you really want fairness then we'd all look basically the same

22:45.010 --> 22:50.600
If you really want fairness then we'd all look basically the same

22:50.600 --> 22:56.560
We will suffer through more nights for a vision instead of standing still

22:50.600 --> 22:56.560
We will suffer through more nights for a vision instead of standing still

22:57.020 --> 23:02.320
Our passion burns until the morning and we advance with closed eyes

22:57.020 --> 23:02.320
Our passion burns until the morning and we advance with closed eyes

23:03.030 --> 23:08.830
I haven't forgotten you despite this passion

23:13.330 --> 23:18.460
I run with only my headlight for guidance

23:18.460 --> 23:24.550
No matter what awaits me I will laugh in this body I was born in

23:18.460 --> 23:24.550
No matter what awaits me I will laugh in this body I was born in

23:24.550 --> 23:30.260
Is there someone running with your taillight for guidance?

23:24.550 --> 23:30.260
Is there someone running with your taillight for guidance?

23:30.260 --> 23:36.350
What you call determination just means bunching up

23:30.260 --> 23:36.350
What you call determination just means bunching up

23:36.350 --> 23:42.070
Is someone going to follow up on all these impressions?

23:36.350 --> 23:42.070
Is someone going to follow up on all these impressions?

23:42.070 --> 23:50.580
Will vowing to never falter let me laugh again?

23:52.540 --> 23:53.200
Fly

23:52.540 --> 23:53.200
Fly
