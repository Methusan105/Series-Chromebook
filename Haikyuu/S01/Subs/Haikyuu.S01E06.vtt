WEBVTT

00:01.480 --> 00:02.770
Sorry!

00:02.770 --> 00:04.400
I'm so sorry, Tanaka!

00:05.690 --> 00:07.610
I told you not to worry about it.

00:07.610 --> 00:10.240
Forget me, are <i>you</i> all right?

00:10.240 --> 00:11.120
Yeah.

00:11.120 --> 00:13.700
Lying down helped. I feel fine now that I'm off the bus.

00:13.700 --> 00:14.700
That so?

00:14.700 --> 00:15.790
Good.

00:15.790 --> 00:19.540
Our match today rests on your shoulders, after all.

00:19.540 --> 00:23.420
Let me spike freely like you did in the three-on-three.

00:23.710 --> 00:24.670
Hey, Tanaka!

00:25.340 --> 00:26.510
No pressure!

00:26.510 --> 00:27.760
Huh? What?

00:27.760 --> 00:30.220
I'll... I'll do my...

00:31.590 --> 00:33.640
I-I need to use the bathroom.

00:33.640 --> 00:35.310
First the top, now the bottom?

00:35.310 --> 00:36.770
Never a moment's rest for you, huh?

00:37.390 --> 00:38.810
Not again.

00:38.810 --> 00:40.270
Pathetic!

00:40.270 --> 00:41.690
Time to beat him into shape.

00:41.690 --> 00:43.770
What are you saying?

00:43.770 --> 00:46.190
You know that won't work on Hinata!

00:46.190 --> 00:48.030
We won't know until we try.

00:48.030 --> 00:50.150
Tanaka, help me stop this fool!

00:50.150 --> 00:50.780
Okay!

00:50.780 --> 00:52.030
Knock it off!

00:51.160 --> 00:52.030
Just once...

00:52.030 --> 00:52.030
{OP}

00:56.660 --> 00:58.870
The heat flickers

00:58.870 --> 01:01.210
Sweat glitters on my skin

01:01.210 --> 01:06.090
Shouts echo and shoulders hit

01:06.090 --> 01:10.760
We asked the sky through the open window

01:06.210 --> 01:12.260
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

01:07.090 --> 01:12.260

Come on, come on, come on

01:18.600 --> 01:21.190
The chance is there

01:21.600 --> 01:23.190
Come on, come on, come on

01:23.190 --> 01:25.360
Do it together

01:27.280 --> 01:31.860
Everybody always wants to stand there,

01:31.860 --> 01:36.580
make mistakes, get angry, and struggle

01:36.580 --> 01:37.910
We'll never give up

01:37.910 --> 01:41.370
We don't want it to end

01:41.370 --> 01:46.880
I will continue on with my imagination

01:48.380 --> 01:53.090
I want to struggle and fall and become stronger

01:53.090 --> 01:57.850
I want to persevere, stand back up, do it again,

01:57.850 --> 01:59.140
and never give up

01:59.140 --> 02:02.440
Let me run

02:02.440 --> 02:08.270
I will run to where my imagination leads me

02:22.000 --> 02:22.000
{Part A}

Episode Six:
An Amusing Team

02:22.500 --> 02:26.500
Episode Six:
An Amusing Team

02:25.920 --> 02:26.920
So...

02:27.290 --> 02:29.130
We're playing Karasuno today, right?

02:29.130 --> 02:30.760
Doesn't <i>he</i> go to that school?

02:31.590 --> 02:33.630
The King of the Court, I mean.

02:33.630 --> 02:36.890
Didn't you two go to the same junior high, Kindaichi?

02:36.890 --> 02:39.220
Oh, you mean Kageyama?

02:39.220 --> 02:41.100
He's not all that special.

02:41.810 --> 02:44.690
Sure, his individual skill may've been off the charts,

02:44.690 --> 02:48.060
but he has no clue what it takes to succeed in a team sport.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.270
He's too egocentric.

02:50.780 --> 02:54.530
Oh? Not like it matters now that he's gone to Karasuno.

02:54.530 --> 02:56.950
They may've been a strong team in the past or whatever,

02:56.950 --> 03:00.910
but right now, all that comes to mind is that their manager's a real hottie.

03:00.910 --> 03:01.740
For real?

03:01.740 --> 03:02.950
Yeah.

03:02.370 --> 03:04.580
Shimizu, I think we're good to go.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.580
She's got this sultry look to her.

03:04.580 --> 03:05.460
Right.

03:05.460 --> 03:09.210
Oh, they also have this punk on their team.

03:09.210 --> 03:11.380
A cueball with a real mean look.

03:11.380 --> 03:13.210
He looks completely retarded.

03:13.710 --> 03:15.130
Oh?

03:18.430 --> 03:20.140
Uh...

03:20.140 --> 03:22.270
Keep looking down on us...

03:25.310 --> 03:27.100
and we'll eat you alive.

03:29.440 --> 03:32.610
You shouldn't threaten them like that, Tanaka.

03:33.280 --> 03:38.070
Look, now these poor elites are shaking in their boots. Don't you feel sorry for them?

03:38.320 --> 03:40.370
L-Like hell we are!

03:40.370 --> 03:41.740
<i>Who's the four-eyes?</i>

03:42.290 --> 03:44.910
<i>I don't remember Karasuno having such a tall player.</i>

03:44.910 --> 03:47.250
I guess.

03:47.250 --> 03:50.210
Gotta limit the bullying to the match proper, right?

03:50.960 --> 03:52.340
You guys!

03:52.340 --> 03:53.920
Can't take my eyes off you for a second!

03:53.920 --> 03:55.550
We're sorry!

03:55.550 --> 03:57.180
D-Don't be.

03:57.180 --> 03:58.510
Knock it off, Tanaka!

04:01.260 --> 04:03.510
Long time no see, King.

04:04.180 --> 04:06.730
Show me what kinda dictatorship you've put in place this time.

04:06.730 --> 04:08.100
I can hardly wait.

04:13.440 --> 04:14.070
Sure.

04:17.990 --> 04:19.450
What's gotten into him?

04:18.910 --> 04:20.410
What was that for?

04:19.450 --> 04:21.490
He's acting all calm and collected.

04:20.410 --> 04:22.120
You've grown up, eh?

04:22.990 --> 04:24.990
<b>Gymnasium #3</b>

04:33.130 --> 04:35.130
M-Massive!

04:35.130 --> 04:37.670
B-Both the gym <i>and</i> the players!

04:37.670 --> 04:38.800
Greet them!

04:38.800 --> 04:42.760
Let's have a good match!

04:44.180 --> 04:49.480
Aoba Jousai is a team whose players are all 
extremely good at both offense and defense.

04:49.940 --> 04:53.810
It's full of guys who would be the star player on any other team.

04:55.320 --> 04:58.190
Plus they're famous as being great blockers.

04:58.190 --> 05:00.200
What's gotten into you two?

05:00.200 --> 05:02.700
We've got Hinata here to throw a spanner in their works!

05:02.700 --> 05:03.620
Right?

05:04.030 --> 05:07.910
But we know that you suck, so we've got your back.

05:10.620 --> 05:13.790
Oh, but you'll be on your own while serving.

05:13.790 --> 05:14.920
Don't you dare screw up.

05:16.710 --> 05:18.340
Just kidding!

05:18.340 --> 05:20.510
Who cares if you mess up a serve here and there?

05:20.510 --> 05:22.800
You don't have to worry about a thing. Justâ€”

05:23.300 --> 05:25.890
Where'd Hinata go?

05:25.890 --> 05:26.970
To the bathroom.

05:26.970 --> 05:28.560
Not again!

05:34.150 --> 05:35.860
Acting like they're hot shit.

05:35.860 --> 05:37.190
Yeah.

05:38.730 --> 05:39.820
<i>This guy...</i>

05:39.820 --> 05:42.990
<i>He was the one standing next to Kageyama when I faced him in junior high.</i>

05:42.990 --> 05:46.030
<i>I remember his turnip head.</i>

05:47.080 --> 05:48.790
Are you a first-year at Karasuno?

05:49.330 --> 05:50.830
Yeah. What of it?

05:50.830 --> 05:54.880
How do you like playing with Kageyama, our king?

05:54.880 --> 05:56.630
He still seems to be up on his high horse.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.670
You've gotta be kidding me!

05:58.670 --> 06:00.840
It goes way beyond that!

06:01.380 --> 06:03.510
Under the iron-fisted rule of Kageyama the Great,

06:03.510 --> 06:06.010
plebeians like me are cruelly oppressed,

06:06.010 --> 06:08.260
our lives filled with suffering!

06:08.560 --> 06:11.810
He acts like he's God's gift to humanity 
just because he happens to be kinda good!

06:12.480 --> 06:13.810
See?

06:13.810 --> 06:15.230
He sure does hate the guy.

06:16.270 --> 06:19.690
He <i>is</i> pretty good at receiving, blocking, and serving.

06:19.690 --> 06:21.360
Yeah. It's enough to piss you off.

06:21.360 --> 06:23.650
But he's awful at setting.

06:21.360 --> 06:23.650
And he's amazing at setting.

06:25.660 --> 06:26.570
At setting?

06:27.280 --> 06:28.160
He's amazing.

06:30.160 --> 06:34.960
Oh, I know. You've never spiked his sets in an actual match before, have you?

06:34.960 --> 06:36.540
They're awful.

06:36.540 --> 06:38.380
"Difficult to spike" is an understatement.

06:38.380 --> 06:39.090
Really?

06:39.840 --> 06:42.470
He's called the egocentric king for a reason.

06:42.470 --> 06:46.800
He fails to do the most obvious thing that's expected of him as a setter: helping the spiker hit the ball.

06:47.430 --> 06:51.810
What he finds essential is pawns that'll move according to his will.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.270
And he throws away anything <i>he</i> doesn't need to win.

07:00.320 --> 07:04.860
Decide whether Kageyama's still the same as he was in junior high <i>after</i> you've watched him play, turnip head.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.200
Right, Hinata?

07:09.450 --> 07:13.200
<i>He throws away anything </i>he<i> doesn't need to win, huh?</i>

07:13.200 --> 07:15.290
<i>If I mess up in front of Kageyama...</i>

07:16.420 --> 07:18.750
Get outta here! You're useless!

07:18.750 --> 07:20.170
<i>...I'll be subbed out!</i>

07:21.670 --> 07:23.550
My tummy hurts!

07:24.670 --> 07:26.760
Okay, then. I'm looking forward to it.

07:30.350 --> 07:33.560
Don't be so nervous, Hinata.

07:33.560 --> 07:34.390
Relax.

07:34.390 --> 07:35.180
Okay!

07:35.180 --> 07:36.640
I'll do my best to relax!

07:36.980 --> 07:38.810
Hurry up and change, Hinata.

07:37.520 --> 07:41.070
Hey, could you say something to cheer that first-year up?

07:38.810 --> 07:39.810
Okay!

07:43.480 --> 07:44.990
Could I talk to you for a sec?

07:48.110 --> 07:49.240
I have high hopes for you.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.830
<i>She finished him off!</i>

07:54.830 --> 07:56.410
<i>Forgive me, Hinata.</i>

07:56.410 --> 07:58.370
Aoba Jousai          Karasuno

07:56.410 --> 07:58.370
Aoba Jousai          Karasuno

07:58.790 --> 08:03.590
The practice match between Karasuno High and Aoba Jousai High will now begin.

08:03.590 --> 08:05.590
Let's have a good match!

08:06.050 --> 08:08.550
That midget's playing middle blocker?

08:08.550 --> 08:09.890
You can't be serious.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.390
It really is Kageyama.

08:11.390 --> 08:12.470
What's he doing at Karasuno?

08:12.470 --> 08:13.310
Beats me.

08:14.100 --> 08:15.980
Pull yourself together, Hinata!

08:15.980 --> 08:16.730
Okay!

08:17.020 --> 08:18.890
I'll do my best to pull myself together!

08:18.890 --> 08:19.690
That's notâ€”

08:19.690 --> 08:21.110
Look, just calm down.

08:21.110 --> 08:22.570
Hey, Hinata!

08:22.570 --> 08:23.610
You get it, don't you?

08:24.150 --> 08:26.360
Play like you did during the three-on-three.

08:26.360 --> 08:27.650
I-I get it!

08:27.650 --> 08:28.990
<i>Do</i> you?

08:30.410 --> 08:32.070
Give us a good serve, Matsukawa!

08:32.870 --> 08:34.740
Okay, I got this!

08:35.450 --> 08:38.120
Are you retarded? That clearly wasn't yours!

08:38.120 --> 08:39.290
I'm sorry!

08:39.290 --> 08:40.250
Take care of it, Ennoshita!

08:40.250 --> 08:40.790
Tanaka!

08:40.790 --> 08:41.580
Got it!

08:45.760 --> 08:47.090
That's one down.

08:48.630 --> 08:49.680
Don't worry about it.

08:49.680 --> 08:52.050
Hinata, calm down and look around you.

08:52.050 --> 08:53.050
I'm sorry!

08:53.850 --> 08:57.520
<i>He's totally overwhelmed.</i>

09:00.940 --> 09:02.400
Hinata!

09:03.020 --> 09:05.110
Just calm down, okay?

09:07.900 --> 09:09.570
Hell yeah! That was lucky!

09:08.780 --> 09:12.740
Aoba Jousai          Karasuno

09:08.780 --> 09:12.740
Aoba Jousai          Karasuno

09:09.570 --> 09:10.820
A net foul, huh?

09:10.820 --> 09:12.740
Karasuno finally scored a point.

09:13.160 --> 09:16.450
Enough with the nerves already, damn it!

09:16.450 --> 09:17.700
I'm sorry!

09:17.700 --> 09:19.830
Give me one more chance!

09:17.700 --> 09:19.830
Yeah, he really isn't all that special.

09:19.830 --> 09:21.420
He hasn't changed one bit.

09:21.710 --> 09:22.750
All right!

09:22.750 --> 09:25.170
Let's make a comeback, one point at a time!

09:25.170 --> 09:26.840
Who's serving next?

09:27.250 --> 09:30.300
<i>This is the worst possible timing.</i>

09:28.590 --> 09:30.300
Aoba Jousai          Karasuno

09:28.590 --> 09:30.300
Aoba Jousai          Karasuno

09:30.800 --> 09:32.550
<i>Hinata has to serve now?</i>

09:33.640 --> 09:35.680
<i>A service error means the opposition score.</i>

09:34.350 --> 09:36.220
Relax, Hinata!

09:35.680 --> 09:38.430
<i>So if I mess this up, they'll win the first set!</i>

09:39.680 --> 09:42.440
Kageyama, I don't think he's breathing.

09:42.440 --> 09:43.480
Is he gonna be okay?

09:43.480 --> 09:45.360
Don't ask me.

09:46.110 --> 09:49.360
He throws away anything <i>he</i> doesn't need to win.

09:49.780 --> 09:51.490
<i>Don't screw up.</i>

09:51.490 --> 09:53.030
<i>I'll get subbed out if I do!</i>

09:53.030 --> 09:53.990
<i>Calm down.</i>

09:53.990 --> 09:56.280
<i>It's okay. It's all right.</i>

09:59.290 --> 10:01.540
<i>Shit! I didn't hit it cleanly!</i>

10:19.140 --> 10:19.180
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:19.180 --> 10:19.220
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:19.220 --> 10:19.270
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:19.220 --> 10:19.270
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:19.270 --> 10:19.310
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:19.270 --> 10:19.310
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:19.310 --> 10:19.350
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:19.310 --> 10:19.350
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:19.350 --> 10:26.020
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:19.350 --> 10:26.020
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:26.020 --> 10:26.020
{Part B}

10:26.150 --> 10:26.190
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:26.190 --> 10:26.230
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:26.230 --> 10:26.270
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:26.230 --> 10:26.270
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:26.270 --> 10:26.310
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:26.270 --> 10:26.310
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:26.310 --> 10:26.360
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:26.310 --> 10:26.360
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:26.360 --> 10:33.030
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:26.360 --> 10:33.030
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:36.620 --> 10:38.580
Aoba Jousai          Karasuno

10:36.620 --> 10:38.580
Aoba Jousai          Karasuno

10:45.790 --> 10:49.170
Hey, is your head okay?

10:46.420 --> 10:48.170
Boom, headshot!

10:49.170 --> 10:51.050
Quit adding fuel to the fire!

10:51.630 --> 10:53.510
Knock it off, you guys!

10:55.260 --> 10:56.720
<i>Now I've really done it.</i>

10:57.600 --> 10:59.390
Hey, Kageyama...

11:00.140 --> 11:02.100
W-Wait!

11:02.430 --> 11:03.810
Let's talk this out!

11:04.180 --> 11:05.270
Kageyama!

11:06.480 --> 11:07.270
Hey...

11:22.200 --> 11:23.040
You know...

11:23.040 --> 11:23.540
Yes?

11:24.290 --> 11:27.250
What is it that's making you so nervous?

11:27.250 --> 11:28.830
Is it our opponents' size?

11:28.830 --> 11:30.750
Or because it's your first practice match?

11:33.090 --> 11:37.010
There's something you find scarier than 
hitting a serve into the back of my head.

11:41.010 --> 11:41.890
What is it?

11:43.810 --> 11:46.060
I can't think of anything.

11:46.730 --> 11:49.900
So there's no reason for you to be nervous anymore, is there?

11:49.900 --> 11:53.070
I mean, you've already gone and done the worst thing possible.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.490
In that case...

11:55.780 --> 11:58.160
hurry up and go back to normal, dumbass!

11:59.660 --> 12:00.280
Huh?

12:00.910 --> 12:02.370
I got away with that?

12:02.370 --> 12:04.290
What are you talking about?

12:04.660 --> 12:08.210
<i>If I got away with that, 
I could've gotten away with anything!</i>

12:08.210 --> 12:11.380
<i>What the hell? That damn turnip head had me scared for a moment!</i>

12:12.920 --> 12:16.800
<i>But we just lost the first set because of me.</i>

12:16.800 --> 12:18.130
<i>Kageyama may've forgiven me, but...</i>

12:18.130 --> 12:20.140
Hey, Hinata.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.800
<i>Eek!</i>

12:22.260 --> 12:23.510
Say...

12:23.510 --> 12:24.720
Yes?

12:24.720 --> 12:28.560
D'you think you have to play as well as the rest of us?

12:28.560 --> 12:30.100
Like you're good enough?

12:30.100 --> 12:34.020
But I'll get subbed out if I don't play well...

12:34.530 --> 12:37.530
I wanna play till the end!

12:37.530 --> 12:40.200
Hey, don't you dare look down on us!

12:40.200 --> 12:43.410
We're well aware that you suck, man!

12:44.160 --> 12:46.660
Daichi put you in the lineup <i>despite</i> being aware of that!

12:47.790 --> 12:50.210
As for getting subbed out...

12:54.090 --> 12:56.420
Cross that bridge when you get to it!

12:57.210 --> 12:59.720
Quit racking your brain over something that <i>might</i> happen!

12:58.010 --> 12:59.300
Shouldn't you stop him?

12:59.300 --> 13:01.640
Oh, yeah. I think we're good.

12:59.720 --> 13:01.640
Not like you have a brain, anyway!

13:01.640 --> 13:02.590
Listen up.

13:02.590 --> 13:04.050
In volleyball,

13:04.560 --> 13:08.270
everyone on your side of the court is your ally, without exception!

13:09.350 --> 13:12.150
So what if you suck? Go ahead and cause trouble for us!

13:12.150 --> 13:13.610
Hold us back!

13:13.610 --> 13:15.770
Making up for all those things...

13:15.770 --> 13:18.740
is our job as your teammates and upperclassmen!

13:20.280 --> 13:22.610
Now show me some respect.

13:22.610 --> 13:23.870
Yes, sir!

13:24.950 --> 13:25.740
Do it again.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.660
I bet he just wants to be called "sir."

13:25.740 --> 13:26.910
Yes, sir!

13:27.660 --> 13:31.120
Yeah, but he's being a huge help.

13:31.670 --> 13:37.590
A speech like that is only effective when delivered by someone who always speaks his mind.

13:32.120 --> 13:34.080
Yes, sir!

13:37.590 --> 13:40.050
Karasuno          Aoba Jousai

13:37.590 --> 13:40.050
Karasuno          Aoba Jousai

13:39.130 --> 13:40.050
What's going on?

13:40.590 --> 13:42.090
A practice match, apparently.

13:42.090 --> 13:43.760
The second set's starting now.

13:44.300 --> 13:47.560
Hey, teach me how to hit a serve at someone's head after the match.

13:48.890 --> 13:50.730
Me too.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.190
Give us a good serve, Ennoshita.

13:55.650 --> 13:57.780
Do the same thing you did in the three-on-three.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.070
Run as fast as you can to an area they're not marking,

14:01.070 --> 14:03.740
jump as high as you can, 
and swing your arm as hard as you can.

14:04.450 --> 14:07.330
But be careful not to run into the other spikers.

14:07.330 --> 14:08.200
Okay.

14:08.540 --> 14:09.120
Kunimi!

14:11.620 --> 14:12.620
Take care of it, Kageyama!

14:12.620 --> 14:13.120
Okay.

14:13.500 --> 14:14.580
Set it to the left!

14:14.580 --> 14:15.000
Right!

14:15.500 --> 14:16.750
<i>They're not gonna do a quick attack.</i>

14:16.750 --> 14:19.380
<i>It'll probably be an open shot from the left or right again.</i>

14:21.300 --> 14:21.970
<i>What the?</i>

14:25.050 --> 14:26.010
A quick attack?

14:27.100 --> 14:27.720
<i>Huh?</i>

14:28.180 --> 14:29.770
<i>It didn't hit my hand.</i>

14:33.730 --> 14:35.350
<i>They can do quick attacks?</i>

14:35.350 --> 14:37.310
<i>Or was that just a bluff?</i>

14:37.310 --> 14:38.980
<i>Either way...</i>

14:39.900 --> 14:43.610
You'd better spike sets like that, lest you incur the King's wrath.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.360
Hinata.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.070
Here it comes.

14:47.950 --> 14:48.990
My bad.

14:48.990 --> 14:51.040
I set that too high.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.120
Kageyama...

14:54.790 --> 14:55.960
...apologized?

14:56.380 --> 14:58.130
I'll think about forgiving you.

14:59.250 --> 15:00.920
Ow!

15:00.920 --> 15:02.380
Ouch! That hurts, Kageyama!

15:02.380 --> 15:04.130
I'll go bald!

15:04.590 --> 15:05.590
Let's take this point.

15:06.390 --> 15:06.840
Nice serve!

15:06.840 --> 15:07.850
Got it.

15:08.260 --> 15:08.970
I got this!

15:10.430 --> 15:12.020
<i>The right wing spiker and setter are on the move!</i>

15:12.020 --> 15:13.480
Send it to me!

15:12.430 --> 15:13.480
<i>The left's waiting for it.</i>

15:13.930 --> 15:15.690
<i>Who will Kageyama use?</i>

15:16.770 --> 15:17.270
<i>Now!</i>

15:17.270 --> 15:18.360
<i>This is it!</i>

15:22.610 --> 15:24.070
All right!

15:24.070 --> 15:25.030
Yeah!

15:25.030 --> 15:25.990
Yes!

15:26.360 --> 15:27.570
There it is.

15:27.570 --> 15:29.950
The freak set-and-spike.

15:30.580 --> 15:31.620
What the hell?

15:31.620 --> 15:32.620
That was fast!

15:33.000 --> 15:34.370
Hinata, Kageyama.

15:35.210 --> 15:36.670
One, two...

15:37.210 --> 15:38.750
Yeah!

15:40.790 --> 15:42.500
It's like we're a team!

15:43.340 --> 15:44.970
"Like a team"?

15:44.970 --> 15:46.180
We <i>are</i> a team.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.350
Got it!

15:50.890 --> 15:52.220
Nice set, Kageyama.

15:52.220 --> 15:53.140
Thank you.

15:53.140 --> 15:55.850
That midget can do fast attacks?

15:53.640 --> 15:54.640
Give us one more.

15:54.640 --> 15:55.850
Sure.

15:55.850 --> 15:57.980
Something's changed since the first set.

15:57.980 --> 15:59.940
<i>Okay, are you scared now?</i>

15:59.940 --> 16:01.110
<i>You are, right?</i>

16:01.110 --> 16:03.360
<i>Keep your eyes locked on Hinata.</i>

16:03.610 --> 16:05.570
Now that Hinata's back to normal,

16:06.570 --> 16:07.910
let's stage a comeback.

16:08.950 --> 16:10.620
Karasuno          Aoba Jousai

16:08.950 --> 16:10.620
Karasuno          Aoba Jousai

16:10.620 --> 16:11.660
A chance!

16:11.660 --> 16:12.330
Got it!

16:12.780 --> 16:15.950
It's not the least bit scary if we know what's coming!

16:16.250 --> 16:17.960
Say what?

16:19.710 --> 16:21.710
Finally!

16:23.960 --> 16:26.260
<i>Shit. The midget was just a decoy this time.</i>

16:26.260 --> 16:28.760
And here I thought it was coming my way!

16:28.760 --> 16:30.640
How'd you like that, turnip head?

16:30.970 --> 16:33.180
I <i>told</i> you to decide after you've watched him play!

16:35.350 --> 16:39.520
I went all like, "Say what?" thinking I'd get to spike! So embarrassing!

16:39.520 --> 16:41.100
That's perfectly fine.

16:41.860 --> 16:45.480
It's <i>because</i> you jump for real 
that you lure the opponents in.

16:46.190 --> 16:47.610
Is that how it works?

16:47.610 --> 16:49.150
It is.

16:49.450 --> 16:50.360
Shit.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.030
Don't lose your cool, Kindaichi.

16:52.780 --> 16:55.160
We're scoring plenty of points ourselves.

16:55.160 --> 16:56.120
Don't let them get to you.

16:56.120 --> 16:56.870
Okay!

17:01.250 --> 17:04.880
Even <i>I</i> can tell that they're splitting the blockers up.

17:05.630 --> 17:08.130
I had no idea Karasuno had such a strong team.

17:11.090 --> 17:12.800
But they mess up a lot too, don't they?

17:23.060 --> 17:24.230
Huddle up!

17:24.230 --> 17:25.520
Okay!

17:26.980 --> 17:28.150
What's up, Hinata?

17:28.900 --> 17:31.910
Back when I played my first match,

17:31.910 --> 17:34.700
I thought I had to do everything all by myself.

17:34.990 --> 17:39.580
But now I have players much
 better than myself around me.

17:34.990 --> 17:36.580
Going good!

17:36.580 --> 17:38.830
Keep this up!

17:38.830 --> 17:40.330
You can count on us!

17:39.580 --> 17:44.040
So all I can do right now is believe in them and jump, right?

17:44.040 --> 17:46.670
There was no need at all to rack my brain.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.090
You sure took your time!

17:50.090 --> 17:53.930
You have no idea what an unbelievable weapon that belief and jumping ability is.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.100
Dude, Kindaichi.

17:56.100 --> 17:58.930
Kageyama's nothing like you said he was!

17:58.930 --> 18:01.980
I-I've never seen anything like this either.

18:01.980 --> 18:05.610
I can't believe there's a spiker who can keep up with his unreasonable sets.

18:05.610 --> 18:07.400
You're mistaken.

18:08.150 --> 18:12.360
It seems to me like that number five isn't looking at the ball at all.

18:13.030 --> 18:14.870
What do you mean, Coach?

18:14.870 --> 18:20.790
I think Kageyama's making pinpoint sets into the palm of his hand.

18:20.790 --> 18:22.790
Is that even possible?

18:23.580 --> 18:27.460
<i>Kageyama</i> of all people consciously working together with someone?

18:27.460 --> 18:31.470
That must mean that number five has enough ability

18:31.720 --> 18:36.640
to make the supposedly egocentric and prideful Kageyama do that.

18:37.050 --> 18:42.390
If you want to know what's really amazing, it's that he trusts Kageyama's sets completely as he jumps.

18:43.350 --> 18:45.730
He's certain that the ball will come to him.

18:46.810 --> 18:49.650
Even if they break free of our blocks, make sure to dig it out!

18:49.650 --> 18:52.530
We've put out our best available lineup, you know!

18:52.530 --> 18:54.030
Show some pride!

18:54.030 --> 18:54.950
Yes, sir!

18:58.120 --> 18:59.700
Okay, time to turn things around!

18:59.410 --> 19:01.700
Kageyama's amazing.

18:59.700 --> 19:00.580
Yeah!

19:01.700 --> 19:04.790
It's too bad we couldn't get him to join us.

19:04.790 --> 19:06.710
We did make him an offer, right?

19:06.710 --> 19:07.790
Yeah.

19:07.790 --> 19:13.880
But even if he <i>had</i> joined us, that doesn't 
necessarily mean he would've still played like that.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.430
Let's keep going and take this set!

19:14.720 --> 19:16.510
Maybe it's <i>because</i> he picked Karasuno...

19:16.510 --> 19:20.760
<i>because</i> he's playing with that number five that he's playing the way he is right now.

19:18.180 --> 19:19.890
Dude, that hurt!

19:19.890 --> 19:21.310
Just trying to fire you up.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.060
Hey, it's time.

19:24.020 --> 19:26.480
Karasuno          Aoba Jousai

19:24.020 --> 19:26.480
Karasuno          Aoba Jousai

19:25.350 --> 19:26.480
Here's our chance!

19:27.810 --> 19:28.730
Tsukishima!

19:30.480 --> 19:31.480
Yes!

19:31.480 --> 19:33.110
Nicely done, Tsukki!

19:33.110 --> 19:34.690
Good job, Tsukishima!

19:34.990 --> 19:38.160
Your sets are so precise it gives me the creeps.

19:39.160 --> 19:43.450
<i>There's probably a better way to put it,
 but I can kinda see where Tsukishima's coming from.</i>

19:39.530 --> 19:42.240
Maybe I should aim for your glasses next time.

19:42.240 --> 19:46.250
Just try it. You'll get thrown out of the gym again.

19:43.450 --> 19:48.250
<i>By the time you think you want the ball to come to a certain point, it's already there.</i>

19:46.250 --> 19:48.250
I'll do it on the sly.

19:48.250 --> 19:49.960
Like hell you can!

19:49.040 --> 19:51.710
<i>It's terrifying, but also really reassuring.</i>

19:49.960 --> 19:51.000
Are you stupid?

19:52.130 --> 19:55.050
That's enough. We're in the middle of a match.

19:55.420 --> 19:56.470
Give us a good serve, Tanaka.

19:56.470 --> 19:57.430
A good one!

19:57.430 --> 19:58.760
I see.

19:58.760 --> 20:13.980
Tanaka

19:58.760 --> 20:13.980
Hinata

19:58.760 --> 20:13.980
Sawamura

19:58.760 --> 20:13.980
Kageyama

19:58.760 --> 20:13.980
Tsukishima

19:58.760 --> 20:13.980
Ennoshita

19:58.760 --> 20:13.980
Sugawara

19:58.760 --> 20:13.980
Yamaguchi

19:58.760 --> 20:13.980
Kinoshita

19:58.760 --> 20:13.980
Narita

19:59.640 --> 20:04.270
The lineup rotates every time we score and gain the serve.

20:04.270 --> 20:08.730
And right now, we have Kageyama, Tsukishima, and Ennoshita in front.

20:08.730 --> 20:09.690
Yeah.

20:09.690 --> 20:13.980
It's the exact opposite of the formation we started the match in.

20:14.280 --> 20:20.870
When Hinata plays in front, his distractions raise the efficiency of our offense.

20:20.870 --> 20:23.700
On the other hand, when Tsukishima plays in front...

20:25.830 --> 20:30.420
we'll have blockers just as overpowering as Seijou!

20:30.790 --> 20:33.590
I hear you're good at blocking too,

20:33.590 --> 20:35.670
but you'd better know your place.

20:36.010 --> 20:40.180
And <i>you'd</i> better make sure you don't get blown away, 
what with you being as thin as a twig.

20:41.390 --> 20:43.510
Stop fighting, guys.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.850
Hey! Your opponents are the guys on the <i>other</i> side!

20:46.390 --> 20:47.810
Watch out! Here they come!

20:51.480 --> 20:52.520
Yeah!

20:53.190 --> 20:55.940
Hey, I was the one who blocked that.

20:55.940 --> 20:57.780
Say what? It hit my hand too.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.240
Knock it off already!

21:00.240 --> 21:02.870
<i>Serves you two right.</i>

21:02.870 --> 21:04.240
What are you smirking for?

21:05.040 --> 21:06.410
Stop that, Kageyama!

21:08.830 --> 21:10.000
Dammit.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.420
Karasuno          Aoba Jousai

21:10.000 --> 21:12.420
Karasuno          Aoba Jousai

21:10.460 --> 21:11.750
We're starting to lose our cool.

21:12.790 --> 21:16.210
Hey, Kunimi! You could've covered for that, fool!

21:16.210 --> 21:19.720
I think we need to stop that number five somehow.

21:19.720 --> 21:23.930
Sure, Kageyama and number five form a formidable duo,

21:23.930 --> 21:25.390
but that's not all.

21:26.100 --> 21:30.730
Tanaka needs to be a bit more level-headed, 
but he's a great spiker with tons of power and spirit.

21:31.350 --> 21:35.570
Tsukishima seems a bit too relaxed, but he's a very clever blocker.

21:36.150 --> 21:40.030
And the captain, Sawamura, more than makes up for their leaky defense.

21:40.280 --> 21:41.070
Send it my way!

21:41.070 --> 21:44.780
They have an extremely green player on their team,
and their defense is full of holes,

21:45.450 --> 21:49.790
but they have a flexible offense built around that greenhorn.

21:50.540 --> 21:53.210
This is what you call toying with another team.

21:54.170 --> 21:56.090
Karasuno, huh?

21:56.090 --> 21:59.300
A bunch of unsteady misfits,

22:00.340 --> 22:01.800
but an amusing team.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.930
Karasuno          Aoba Jousai

22:01.800 --> 22:03.930
Karasuno          Aoba Jousai

22:05.140 --> 22:06.640
They took the set!

22:07.510 --> 22:08.430
Damn it!

22:08.430 --> 22:09.770
Hell yeah!

22:08.930 --> 22:10.430
Nice set, Kageyama.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.310
Thank you.

22:11.310 --> 22:13.900
Let's keep this up and win the last set!

22:14.810 --> 22:18.780
Good thing they don't have anyone who serves like Kageyama.

22:16.940 --> 22:18.360
A comeback victory!

22:18.360 --> 22:32.000
Victory!

22:18.780 --> 22:23.450
Yeah. We're not too good at receiving.

22:23.450 --> 22:24.410
Thanks.

22:24.410 --> 22:25.740
We can't let our guards down.

22:28.410 --> 22:32.000
This is just a hunch, but I don't think they're playing their starting setterâ€”

22:34.370 --> 22:37.340
Oh, you're back, Oikawa.

22:41.970 --> 22:41.970
{ED}

22:52.600 --> 22:56.520
If I tell you this story,

22:56.520 --> 23:00.280
I wonder if I can explain to you

23:00.780 --> 23:04.740
my feelings

23:04.740 --> 23:07.740
and the distance between us

23:08.450 --> 23:16.420
Standing on an empty field

23:16.750 --> 23:25.340
I breathe out into the night air

23:25.340 --> 23:29.890
Countless times I swore that I would change

23:29.890 --> 23:33.890
I stumbled and fell a lot,

23:33.890 --> 23:37.850
but I swore I would laugh at the end

23:37.850 --> 23:41.780
and not let my tears go to waste

23:41.780 --> 23:45.780
There are so many dreams that can definitely come true

23:45.780 --> 23:49.780
I always sat somewhere, downcast, dejected, depressed,

23:49.780 --> 23:52.330
but still I decided I would fight,

23:52.330 --> 23:57.330
and not let all my frustration go to waste

23:57.330 --> 24:01.670
This is our revenge
