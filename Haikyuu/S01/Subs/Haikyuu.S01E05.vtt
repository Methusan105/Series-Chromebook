03:20.510 --> 03:21.310
Frankly,

03:21.850 --> 03:25.350
Tsukishima's team had better figure out a way to stop Kageyama and Hinata

03:25.350 --> 03:29.610
or else they're gonna have a hard time, 
considering they lack attacking firepower.

03:32.230 --> 03:33.940

Kageyama may be awesome,

but making those precise sets 
looks like it's taking its toll on him.

04:14.820 --> 04:18.070
Hinata seems worn out due to running around way more than typical.

04:18.990 --> 04:21.030

D-Daichi, Suga...

04:41.840 --> 04:46.020

04:46.020 --> 04:47.480
You're incredible!

04:49.560 --> 04:53.940
Get them to work in combination and
 Karasuno will evolve by leaps and bounds!

04:54.480 --> 04:57.440

04:58.490 --> 05:00.110
As if, dumbass!

05:00.110 --> 05:04.740
I meant he should make sets that Hinata would find easy to hit.

05:04.740 --> 05:05.910
As for me,

05:05.910 --> 05:10.960
I thought Hinata could learn to keep up with Kageyama's somewhat unreasonable sets.

05:11.420 --> 05:14.250
But they betrayed my expectations in a good way.

05:17.510 --> 05:18.840
How should I put this?

05:19.510 --> 05:21.800
I was hoping for this to happen, but instead,

05:22.970 --> 05:24.760
<i>this</i> is what we ended up with.

05:25.810 --> 05:29.730
Hinata's inexperienced, but he's got natural speed and jumping ability.

05:29.730 --> 05:33.770
And Kageyama's skills allow him to put them to great use.

05:34.610 --> 05:37.610

05:39.320 --> 05:41.990
What? Do you have a problem?

05:39.650 --> 05:43.530
They might be a better duo than we ever imagined.

05:41.990 --> 05:43.530
Of course I do!

05:43.530 --> 05:45.200
Come on, let's go.

Tsukishima!

05:50.450 --> 05:51.120
What?

05:51.500 --> 05:54.460
We're supposed to shake hands before and after every match.

05:54.460 --> 05:56.590
Though we did forgot about it earlier.

05:56.590 --> 05:59.460
Besides, we're gonna be teammates from now on.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.220
Not that I'm happy about it.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.510
Hurry up, man!

06:06.180 --> 06:07.850
Don't you know?

06:07.850 --> 06:12.140
If you don't treat your teammates with respect, you'll get thrown out of the gym!

06:12.690 --> 06:15.610
But you guys got banned from the gym

06:15.610 --> 06:19.400
because you ignored the captain's 
orders and began some farcical contest

06:19.400 --> 06:21.990
which led to you sending the Vice Principal's wig flying.

06:23.150 --> 06:26.320
Don't be so nitpicky.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.700
Come on, shake hands!

What are you doing?

06:28.740 --> 06:30.490
Stay away!

06:30.490 --> 06:31.370

06:43.920 --> 06:45.760
I didn't really care for it.

06:45.760 --> 06:48.300
We were up against a king from an elite school.

06:48.300 --> 06:51.810
It's no surprise that we <i>plebeians</i> couldn't beat him.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.270

Welcome to the team!

08:18.480 --> 08:19.480
Thanks!

08:22.190 --> 08:24.110
And then, you do this!

08:23.610 --> 08:25.610
Well, I guess things got sorted out.

08:24.110 --> 08:25.030
Like this?

08:26.530 --> 08:29.820
You and Tanaka did your best to make sure that happened, right?

08:29.820 --> 08:32.070
Huh? We didn't really do anything.

08:32.830 --> 08:35.450

What's gotten into you two?

08:43.040 --> 08:44.250
Hey, Hinata!

08:44.250 --> 08:45.920
You've had enough of a break, I take it.

08:46.550 --> 08:49.720
Let's get back to practicing quick attacks while it's still fresh in our minds.

08:49.720 --> 08:50.630
Sure!

08:50.630 --> 08:52.890
Tanaka, please pass for us.

08:52.890 --> 08:55.180
What? Already?

08:56.850 --> 08:57.810
I did it!

08:57.810 --> 08:59.310
I arranged one!

09:02.020 --> 09:03.480
A practice match!

09:03.480 --> 09:06.980
Our opponents are one of the top four teams in the prefecture: Aoba Jousai High!

09:06.980 --> 09:08.190

09:08.440 --> 09:08.990
Ack.

09:08.990 --> 09:09.780
No way.

09:09.780 --> 09:12.240

09:12.990 --> 09:14.490
Aoba Jousai...

09:15.830 --> 09:20.290
Oh, you two must be the Hinata and Kageyama I've heard so much about.

09:21.040 --> 09:22.920
Who's he? A teacher?

09:22.920 --> 09:23.750
Beats me.

09:24.710 --> 09:28.010
I'm Takeda Ittetsu, the volleyball team's advisor starting this year.

09:28.010 --> 09:28.960
Hello.

09:29.380 --> 09:33.510
I don't have any experience with volleyball, so I can't really coach you guys,

09:33.510 --> 09:36.140
but I'll do my best to take care of everything else.

09:36.140 --> 09:37.060
Nice to meet you.

09:37.520 --> 09:38.390
Likewise, sir!

09:39.180 --> 09:39.980
Sir...

09:40.810 --> 09:46.650
Oh, I've been running all over the place trying to find us an opponent, so I haven't had any time to show up here.

09:46.650 --> 09:50.400
How'd you get such a strong team to agree?

09:50.400 --> 09:52.320
Don't tell me you kowtowed again...

09:52.320 --> 09:53.860
I didn't!

09:53.860 --> 09:56.780
I'm great at kowtowing, but I didn't do it this time.

09:57.580 --> 10:00.250
Just... they only agreed under one condition.

10:00.250 --> 10:00.960
A condition?

10:01.620 --> 10:04.710
Kageyama must play as setter for the entire match.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.340
What's that supposed to mean?

10:08.340 --> 10:13.590
They have no interest in Karasuno, but they wanna take precautions against Kageyama?

10:13.590 --> 10:17.010
They lookin' down on us? Turnin' their noses up?

10:17.010 --> 10:20.270
I-It's not like that...

10:20.270 --> 10:23.190
I don't see a problem. An opportunity like this doesn't come along too often.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.690
Seriously?

10:24.690 --> 10:27.360
<i>You're</i> our starting setter, you know!

10:28.110 --> 10:29.150
I...

10:30.030 --> 10:36.410
I wanna see how effective Hinata and Kageyama's plays will be against one of the big four.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.290
Please give us the details, sir.

10:43.580 --> 10:44.250
Okay.

10:44.250 --> 10:48.500
Well, this might be a bit sudden, but the match's next Tuesday.

10:49.090 --> 10:51.960
There's not much time after school, 
so you'll only be playing one best-of-three.

10:52.420 --> 10:54.090
We'll be using a school bus to travel there.

10:53.050 --> 10:55.680
<i>A match!</i>

10:54.800 --> 10:56.180
As soon as homeroom ends...

10:56.180 --> 11:00.060
<i>This will be my first match at Karasuno with a full lineup!</i>

11:00.060 --> 11:01.520
Don't be late.

11:01.520 --> 11:02.430
Yes, sir!

11:04.350 --> 11:05.600
Dismissed!

11:05.600 --> 11:06.770
Thank you, sir!

11:10.360 --> 11:11.480
Sugawara!

11:19.870 --> 11:23.040
I got into the starting lineup by default this time,

11:23.040 --> 11:25.460
but I'll earn my spot next time!

11:27.790 --> 11:33.170
I didn't expect you to take notice of me, so I'm a little surprised.

11:34.470 --> 11:35.760
Why wouldn't I?

11:35.760 --> 11:39.050
Well, you're physically and technically far better than me.

11:39.050 --> 11:42.680
But you have way more experience. 
It won't be easy to make up for that.

11:42.680 --> 11:44.100
Also...

11:44.100 --> 11:44.930
Suga!

11:44.930 --> 11:46.640
Sugawara!

11:47.980 --> 11:54.230
Y-You also have the t-t-trust of the other members.

11:55.780 --> 11:59.620
<i>He must still be hurting from 
that match back in junior high.</i>

11:59.620 --> 12:00.570
There you have it.

12:01.080 --> 12:02.790
I'm coming for you!

12:04.950 --> 12:07.290
And I won't go down without a fight.

12:07.710 --> 12:09.120
Suga!

12:09.120 --> 12:11.630
Daichi said he'll treat us to some meat buns!

12:11.630 --> 12:12.960
But hey, Kageyama,

12:12.960 --> 12:20.430
<b>Foot of the Slope</b>

12:13.550 --> 12:18.380
don't a lot of players from Kitagawa First
 eventually go to high school at Aoba Jousai?

12:18.380 --> 12:20.430
Oh, yeah.

12:21.760 --> 12:25.390
<i>Kageyama's former teammates must go there...</i>

12:25.390 --> 12:29.650
Well, you know, I was wondering if that'd make things harder for you.

12:30.730 --> 12:33.610
Maybe if we'd ended up on the same team, sure,

12:34.190 --> 12:37.030
but if I'm taking them on, I'll just give it my all.

12:37.950 --> 12:40.200
That so? I guess that makes sense.

12:40.200 --> 12:40.990
Yeah.

12:41.450 --> 12:43.370
Are you really okay with this, Suga?

12:43.370 --> 12:44.790
I...

12:44.790 --> 12:46.950
I can't accept it!

12:48.290 --> 12:51.330
It does hurt, of course, but even so,

12:52.710 --> 12:57.880
I want them to see just how mistaken they are if they think Kageyama hasn't changed since junior high.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.340
Agreed.

13:00.760 --> 13:04.300
And let's show them that Kageyama's not the
 only reason they should be scared of our team.

13:04.300 --> 13:05.310
Right, Hinata?

13:08.850 --> 13:10.230
Wighd, Gabden!

13:10.230 --> 13:12.730
Who gave you permission to start stuffing your face?!

13:12.730 --> 13:13.730
Screw you!

13:14.270 --> 13:16.860
Hey, volleyball team! 
Quit making a scene in front of the store!

13:17.940 --> 13:19.110
We're sorry.

13:21.570 --> 13:22.950
<i>Oh...</i>

13:22.950 --> 13:24.660
<i>Volleyball team, huh?</i>

13:24.660 --> 13:27.790
<i>Everyone here is part of the team.</i>

13:28.790 --> 13:29.710
<i>We're on...</i>

13:30.500 --> 13:31.750
Thank you.

13:31.750 --> 13:32.920
Are there any curry buns?

13:33.250 --> 13:35.130
You'd better not skip dinner after this.

13:35.540 --> 13:37.800
Hey! Come and get some too!

13:37.800 --> 13:38.840
Thank you!

13:40.260 --> 13:41.970
<i>We're on the same team!</i>

13:44.640 --> 13:47.600
Kageyama, let me have a moment once you're done eating.

13:47.600 --> 13:48.770
Sure.

13:49.100 --> 13:50.270
Keep it down, you hear me?

13:50.270 --> 13:50.850
Okay.

13:50.850 --> 13:54.480
I was wondering which position to use Hinata in for the practice match.

13:54.770 --> 13:56.360
What do you think?

13:58.070 --> 13:58.110
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

13:58.110 --> 13:58.150

13:58.150 --> 13:58.190

13:58.230 --> 13:58.280

13:58.280 --> 14:04.950

13:58.280 --> 14:04.950

14:04.950 --> 14:04.950

14:05.070 --> 14:05.120

14:05.280 --> 14:11.960
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

14:05.280 --> 14:11.960
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

14:13.790 --> 14:16.920
So, about the lineup for the practice match...

14:17.840 --> 14:18.880
I think we should go with this.

14:18.880 --> 14:21.970
Tanaka

14:18.880 --> 14:21.970
Hinata

14:18.880 --> 14:21.970
Sawamura

14:18.880 --> 14:21.970
Kageyama

14:18.880 --> 14:21.970
Tsukishima

14:18.880 --> 14:21.970
Ennoshita

14:18.880 --> 14:21.970
Sugawara

14:18.880 --> 14:21.970
Yamaguchi

14:18.880 --> 14:21.970
Kinoshita

14:18.880 --> 14:21.970
Narita

14:22.550 --> 14:25.140
We want to use Kageyama and Hinata as a set.

14:25.140 --> 14:26.640
<i>A set...</i>

14:25.140 --> 14:26.640
<i>A set...</i>

14:26.640 --> 14:29.970
And Tsukishima is one of the very few tall players we have.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.850
I wanna see how they fare against Seijou.

14:32.850 --> 14:34.190
Okaaay.

14:34.730 --> 14:37.150
<i>I'm the only first-year who missed out.</i>

14:37.150 --> 14:40.980
Why's Hinata in a position which places importance on height?

14:41.780 --> 14:43.110
Middle blocker?

14:43.110 --> 14:45.360
Am I playing the same position as Tsukishima the beanpole?

14:45.360 --> 14:45.820

15:06.180 --> 15:09.890
they block opposition attacks and
 also score points via quick attacks.

15:09.890 --> 15:12.930
Also, they act as decoys to lure in opposition blocks.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.190
Is that okay?

15:15.190 --> 15:18.060
There <i>are</i> other positions, 
like ones that specialize in defense,

15:18.060 --> 15:19.650
but that'll do for now.

15:20.110 --> 15:21.690
Listen up, Hinata.

15:22.610 --> 15:24.900
You are the greatest decoy!

15:27.030 --> 15:28.410
The greatest...

15:28.700 --> 15:30.370
de... coy?

15:31.790 --> 15:34.040
I'm not too happy about this.

15:34.040 --> 15:38.420
We'll rack up a bunch of points using quick attacks and make the opposition's defense focus on you.

15:38.420 --> 15:40.590
That'll make things easier for the other spikers.

15:40.920 --> 15:42.050
Oh!

15:42.590 --> 15:48.180
If a bunch of tall guys like Tsukishima were to stupidly fall for your tricks,

15:49.510 --> 15:50.680
wouldn't it feel great?

15:52.140 --> 15:53.850
That sounds really good!

15:53.850 --> 15:56.940
Hey! You'd better not be calling Tsukki stupid!

15:56.940 --> 15:58.850
Shut up, Yamaguchi.

15:58.850 --> 16:00.110
Sorry, Tsukki.

16:00.610 --> 16:01.730
On the other hand,

16:01.730 --> 16:05.900
assume that our entire offense will
 collapse if you don't prove effective.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.490
Hey!

16:08.490 --> 16:10.450
Don't put too much pressure on the guy!

16:10.740 --> 16:15.500
Collapse...

16:15.500 --> 16:16.410
Look what you've done!

16:16.710 --> 16:19.630
But what about blocking? That's just as important.

16:19.960 --> 16:21.590
No matter how high his vertical,

16:21.590 --> 16:27.010
it's gonna take him more time to reach the 
peak of his jump in comparison to taller guys.

16:27.010 --> 16:27.880
Yeah.

16:27.880 --> 16:33.470
So Hinata's gonna have to focus less on knocking down opposition spikes

16:34.260 --> 16:35.390
and more on touching them.

16:36.430 --> 16:38.980
We're gonna use his ridiculously high reaction speed

16:39.440 --> 16:42.730
and have him slow down opposition spikes by touching them somehow,

16:44.230 --> 16:45.190
I got it!

16:44.570 --> 16:47.240
which will give us a better chance
 to dig them out and counterattack.

16:47.650 --> 16:50.320
Will that really work?

16:50.320 --> 16:52.120
It probably won't.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.580
Not immediately, at least.

16:55.410 --> 16:58.750
But I'm sure we'll learn something by trying it out.

16:58.750 --> 17:00.670
It <i>is</i> a practice match, after all.

17:00.670 --> 17:01.790
Right.

17:02.500 --> 17:03.540
More than anything,

17:03.540 --> 17:08.720
Tsukishima and Kageyama are the only people on our
 team who can match Hinata's vertical in an aerial battle.

17:10.010 --> 17:11.800
So believe in yourself, Hinata...

17:11.800 --> 17:13.680
Yes, sir! I'll do my best!

17:13.680 --> 17:15.760
I'll score a lot of points, act as a decoy,

17:15.760 --> 17:18.810
serve, block, and run quick attacks!

17:17.600 --> 17:19.310
Whoa, whoa! Calm down!

17:20.480 --> 17:21.480
He short-circuited!

17:21.480 --> 17:23.770
Hinata short-circuited!

17:30.650 --> 17:31.820
Sawamura!

17:32.320 --> 17:34.030
Hey, Michimiya.

17:34.450 --> 17:35.120
What's up?

17:35.120 --> 17:37.490
I heard you're playing Seijou tomorrow.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.040
I'm surprised you managed to arrange that.

17:39.040 --> 17:40.660
Oh, yeah.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.790
Mr. Takeda did his best.

17:42.790 --> 17:44.960
Aren't you scared, though?

17:44.960 --> 17:48.840
Didn't Seijou reach the prefectural semifinals last year?

17:48.840 --> 17:50.970
Aren't you scared they'll destroy you?

17:53.010 --> 17:56.310
The thing is, some pretty interesting first-years joined us recently.

17:56.310 --> 17:58.270
Oh, I've heard about them.

17:58.270 --> 18:01.940
You mean the ones who sent the Vice Principal's wig flying right after they joined—

18:00.810 --> 18:02.770
Whoa there!

18:07.900 --> 18:09.860
They're still a work in progress,

18:10.530 --> 18:12.360
but if they prove effective,

18:12.360 --> 18:16.160
I think Karasuno can improve by leaps and bounds.

18:19.080 --> 18:21.200
Can first-years really use the clubroom too?

18:21.200 --> 18:22.960
Yeah. No problem.

18:24.580 --> 18:26.080
Hey!

18:26.380 --> 18:27.920
Hello!

18:27.920 --> 18:29.550
Excuse us!

18:31.920 --> 18:34.090
Did this really make your jaw drop?

18:34.090 --> 18:35.470
It's just a normal clubroom, isn't it?

18:35.840 --> 18:38.310
I've never actually been in a clubroom before.

18:39.220 --> 18:41.810
The Little Giant once used this place too, right?

18:42.770 --> 18:45.650
You finally make your debut tomorrow, Hinata.

18:46.650 --> 18:48.860
Though it's just a practice match.

18:49.820 --> 18:52.280
Seijou's gym is huge, y'know.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.910
All of their players are too, 
so be careful you don't get intimidated.

18:55.740 --> 18:56.700
Hey.

18:56.700 --> 18:57.570
Hey!

18:58.160 --> 18:59.200
Hello there!

18:59.200 --> 18:59.870
As...

18:59.870 --> 19:00.540
As?

19:01.040 --> 19:02.870
As if I'd ever get intimidated.

19:02.870 --> 19:05.420
I'll steal the spotlight, and...

19:05.420 --> 19:06.580
Hinata, my boy.

19:06.920 --> 19:08.790
You know that thing you're trying to wear?

19:08.790 --> 19:09.840
It's a <i>jacket</i>.

19:12.380 --> 19:15.090
What's the matter? Is that supposed to be fashionable?

19:12.960 --> 19:14.050
Kageyama...

19:14.760 --> 19:16.510
Is Hinata gonna be all right tomorrow?

19:15.090 --> 19:17.390
You look ridiculous!

19:17.390 --> 19:19.010
What do you mean?

19:19.550 --> 19:24.310
I mean, the only match experience he's had is that match back in junior high.

19:21.180 --> 19:23.390
Dude, just how panicked <i>are</i> you?

19:23.390 --> 19:25.060
N-N-Not at all!

19:24.310 --> 19:27.980
So a match must mean the world to him. And that'd only make him more anxious.

19:25.060 --> 19:27.980
I-I-I was just trying to play the fool! It was on purpose!

19:27.980 --> 19:29.900
You're stuttering way too much, man!

19:28.650 --> 19:31.400
I bet he's a nervous wreck right now.

19:32.440 --> 19:34.030
But doesn't everyone get nervous bef—

19:34.030 --> 19:35.360
Oh, come on!

19:35.360 --> 19:36.660
I can't believe you!

19:36.660 --> 19:38.990
You're totally underestimating a wimp's anxiety!

19:40.080 --> 19:43.500
No matter what I say to him, it only seems to put him under even more pressure.

19:43.500 --> 19:44.750
Hinata.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.120
About the key to the clubroom...

19:46.120 --> 19:47.830
It's all right! I'll keep it with me!

19:47.830 --> 19:50.630
That's not it. I brought it because I hadn't told you where we usually keep it.

19:50.630 --> 19:53.800
I'm sorry!

19:54.260 --> 19:56.680
That's just how it goes at the beginning.

20:00.350 --> 20:02.600
It'd probably be better to just leave him alone.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.020
You think?

20:06.020 --> 20:08.480
<i>I have to play well tomorrow.</i>

20:08.480 --> 20:12.940
<i>Unlike junior high or the three-on-three the other day, from now on...</i>

20:13.980 --> 20:15.900
<i>I can be replaced!</i>

20:16.990 --> 20:18.280
<i>No!</i>

20:18.280 --> 20:19.910
<i>I don't wanna be subbed out!</i>

20:19.910 --> 20:23.700
<i>I'm finally getting the chance to stand on the court with actual teammates.</i>

20:23.700 --> 20:26.250
<i>I wanna play the entire match!</i>

20:30.750 --> 20:35.550
I can't screw up.

20:36.380 --> 20:38.050
Oh, sorry about that.

20:38.050 --> 20:40.300
You're so tiny that I couldn't see you.

20:41.720 --> 20:43.720
O-Okay.

20:44.260 --> 20:52.400
I can't screw up.

20:49.600 --> 20:50.940
The hell's up with him?

20:50.940 --> 20:52.400
Who knows?

20:53.360 --> 20:54.650
Hey, Kageyama.

20:53.940 --> 20:56.740
Huh? Where'd my pants go?

20:54.650 --> 20:58.990
Don't put Hinata under any more pressure by 
saying something unnecessary like you always do.

21:00.280 --> 21:01.950
Unnecessary?

21:03.370 --> 21:05.740
<i>Have I ever done that?</i>

21:06.660 --> 21:08.660
<i>It's not ringing any bells.</i>

21:10.500 --> 21:12.420
<i>He's not aware of it?</i>

21:14.170 --> 21:15.590
Hinata!

21:15.880 --> 21:18.220
Those are <i>my</i> pants, dude!

21:19.720 --> 21:22.590
What's wrong with you, Tanaka? You pervert!

21:22.590 --> 21:24.850
Are you retarded? Disgusting!

21:35.360 --> 21:43.110
I can't sleep!

21:43.110 --> 21:44.870
Keep it down, Bro!

21:44.870 --> 21:46.160
S-Sorry.

22:06.930 --> 22:07.720
Sure.

22:11.140 --> 22:13.560
Here, Hinata. Have a snack.

22:15.310 --> 22:17.110
What's with that face, man?

22:18.020 --> 22:20.860
Oh, I kinda couldn't sleep last night...

22:22.030 --> 22:23.780
W-Window...

22:23.780 --> 22:25.450
Mind if I open the window?

22:29.660 --> 22:31.580
Stop!

22:33.460 --> 22:34.250
<i>Huh?</i>

22:34.710 --> 22:35.540
<i>This kinda looks...</i>

22:36.040 --> 22:37.460
<i>...worse than we thought.</i>

22:39.840 --> 22:41.340
<i>Are we in big trouble?!</i>

22:41.920 --> 22:41.920
{ED}

22:52.560 --> 22:56.480
If I tell you this story,

22:56.480 --> 23:00.230
I wonder if I can explain to you

23:00.730 --> 23:04.700
my feelings

23:04.700 --> 23:07.700
and the distance between us

23:08.410 --> 23:16.370
Standing on an empty field

23:16.710 --> 23:25.300
I breathe out into the night air

23:25.300 --> 23:29.850
Countless times I swore that I would change

23:29.850 --> 23:33.850
I stumbled and fell a lot,

23:33.850 --> 23:37.810
but I swore I would laugh at the end

23:37.810 --> 23:41.730
and not let my tears go to waste

23:41.730 --> 23:45.740
There are so many dreams that can definitely come true

23:45.740 --> 23:49.740
I always sat somewhere, downcast, dejected, depressed,

23:49.740 --> 23:52.290
but still I decided I would fight,

23:52.290 --> 23:57.290
and not let all my frustration go to waste

23:57.290 --> 24:01.630
This is our revenge
