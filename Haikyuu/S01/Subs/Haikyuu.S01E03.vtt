00:06.530 --> 00:08.200
Hey, your feet stopped short!

00:08.860 --> 00:11.240
What happened to your serve
 receiving reflexes from yesterday?

00:11.240 --> 00:12.620
You need to focus!

00:13.490 --> 00:15.500
I've had enough of receiving.

00:16.080 --> 00:17.750
We're running out of time, dude!

00:17.750 --> 00:19.460
I wanna spike too! I wanna jump too!

00:19.460 --> 00:20.670
Go jump around, then!

00:20.670 --> 00:21.500
Hey, you guys.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.210
I should give you fair warning.

00:24.840 --> 00:28.680
Daichi is usually gentle, but he's 
extremely scary when he gets angry.

00:28.680 --> 00:29.680
I mean extremely.

00:32.850 --> 00:33.890
We know.

00:34.220 --> 00:36.720
It won't be good if he finds out about this practice.

00:36.720 --> 00:37.770
It won't be good for me.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.940
Not that I'm scared or anything.

00:40.940 --> 00:43.110
Absolutely not. Not in the least.

00:44.190 --> 00:49.240
Anyway, we're only ones that know about this extra-early practice, so make sure that you...

00:49.950 --> 00:52.570
Oh? So you <i>are</i> practicing already.

00:52.570 --> 00:53.870
Suga.

00:53.870 --> 00:54.700
Hey.

00:54.950 --> 00:56.120
But why...

00:55.240 --> 00:56.620
<i>He's a third-year.</i>

00:56.120 --> 00:59.540
Because you were clearly acting weird yesterday.

00:59.540 --> 01:03.750
I mean, you asked to hold on to the keys 
despite barely making it on time most days.

01:05.710 --> 01:08.130
Relax. I won't tell Daichi.

01:08.840 --> 01:12.090
This is like secret training or something. It's kind of thrilling.

01:13.970 --> 01:13.970

01:18.600 --> 01:20.810
The heat flickers

01:20.810 --> 01:23.150
Sweat glitters on my skin

01:23.150 --> 01:28.030
Shouts echo and shoulders hit

01:28.030 --> 01:32.700

01:40.540 --> 01:43.120
The chance is there

01:43.540 --> 01:45.130
Come on, come on, come on

01:45.130 --> 01:47.300
Do it together

01:49.210 --> 01:53.800
Everybody always wants to stand there,

01:53.800 --> 01:58.510
make mistakes, get angry, and struggle

01:58.510 --> 01:59.850
We'll never give up

01:59.850 --> 02:03.310
We don't want it to end

02:03.310 --> 02:08.820
I will continue on with my imagination

02:10.320 --> 02:15.030
I want to struggle and fall and become stronger

02:15.030 --> 02:19.790
I want to persevere, stand back up, do it again,

02:19.790 --> 02:21.080
and never give up

02:21.080 --> 02:24.370
Let me run

02:24.370 --> 02:30.210
I will run to where my imagination leads me

Episode Three:
 A Formidable Ally

02:44.560 --> 02:48.770
Come and get it!

02:48.770 --> 02:50.570
Good, that was excellent.

02:51.570 --> 02:52.990
Hinata, don't get distracted.

02:53.280 --> 02:54.780
I want to hit the ball too.

02:54.780 --> 02:56.740
Set for me too.

02:58.410 --> 03:00.200
You love setting, don't you?

03:00.200 --> 03:02.450
So set for me too!

03:03.790 --> 03:05.540
Just one.

03:05.040 --> 03:06.620
Hey, Hinata...

03:05.540 --> 03:07.250
Just try me out once.

03:08.420 --> 03:09.000
Hell no.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.710
Come on! Quit being a spoilsport!

03:12.710 --> 03:13.970
Yeah!

03:18.760 --> 03:20.430
That one came right at you.

03:20.430 --> 03:22.640
Sets and attacks only come <i>after</i> a receive.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.140
Stop acting like you're hot shit 
when you can't even manage that.

03:25.640 --> 03:29.560
For the three-on-three match this Saturday, 
I'm going to set for Tanaka as much as I can.

03:30.270 --> 03:32.320
Let <i>him</i> do the attacking.

03:32.320 --> 03:34.860
As for you, just try not to hold us down.

03:38.530 --> 03:43.660
Will you set for me if I learn to receive properly?

03:44.160 --> 03:47.920
I'll set for anyone I deem essential to winning.

03:48.880 --> 03:52.590
But right now, I don't think you are.

03:54.130 --> 03:55.590
Nasty!

03:55.590 --> 03:58.050
What's it take to set him a few here and there?

03:58.050 --> 03:59.970
We're almost out of time. We'd better clean up.

03:59.970 --> 04:00.970
Crap.

04:00.970 --> 04:02.140
Hurry!

04:02.140 --> 04:03.180
Erase all evidence!

04:03.180 --> 04:04.140
Tanaka, get a mop!

04:03.560 --> 04:04.930
<i>Damn it.</i>

04:04.140 --> 04:04.930
Okay!

04:05.850 --> 04:07.520
<i>Damn it!</i>

04:22.620 --> 04:23.990
Hinata,

04:23.990 --> 04:28.500
lower your hips more, and hit it like you're sending it right back in the direction it came from.

04:28.500 --> 04:29.290
Got it.

04:29.620 --> 04:30.420
Here goes.

04:31.710 --> 04:33.460
Oh, that was a good one.

04:33.460 --> 04:34.420
Hey, Hinata.

04:35.130 --> 04:37.510
Want me to set for you starting tomorrow morning?

04:37.510 --> 04:39.550
Really? You will?

04:40.220 --> 04:43.640
I'm Karasuno's starting setter, you know.

04:43.640 --> 04:45.390
You want to practice spiking, right?

04:45.390 --> 04:49.060
R-Right! I love spiking.

04:49.060 --> 04:52.770
It feels great when you get one
 just right. Above all, it's so cool!

04:53.400 --> 04:55.360
Sounds like you've got quite the spiking fixation.

04:56.150 --> 05:01.820
When I was junior high, I didn't even have 
teammates until third year, let alone a setter.

05:02.070 --> 05:05.540
My friend on the basketball team would set for me.

05:07.540 --> 05:10.000
Crap. I'm sorry. I didn't mean for it to go there.

05:10.540 --> 05:18.090
Even after I retired, I had first-years, volleyball moms, and setters from the girl's team set for me.

05:19.090 --> 05:21.220
But while they were good friends of mine,

05:21.970 --> 05:24.970
they were never really teammates.

05:26.930 --> 05:30.480
So I was really looking forward to meeting the setter I'd have in high school.

05:30.770 --> 05:31.560
You're such a let-down.

05:32.520 --> 05:33.520
I had high hopes...

05:33.900 --> 05:34.730
You suck.

05:35.610 --> 05:36.900
...until I got here.

05:36.900 --> 05:39.240
Like I said, I'm a setter too.

05:39.240 --> 05:40.440
Don't worry. I'll set for you.

05:43.990 --> 05:48.160
But if I make you set for me...

05:48.160 --> 05:51.460
I'd kinda feel like I've lost.

05:53.710 --> 05:56.380
Why do you keep getting in Kageyama's face?

05:56.960 --> 06:00.840
Personally, I try to avoid getting on the bad side of good players as much as possible.

06:02.340 --> 06:03.590
When I faced him in junior high,

06:04.430 --> 06:06.640
he was great at everything he did.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.720
<i>And</i> he was taller than me, to boot.

06:09.310 --> 06:10.850
He was just so formidable.

06:11.980 --> 06:15.060
I really hated it when he stood in front of me.

06:15.060 --> 06:16.560
I understand how that must feel.

06:17.480 --> 06:21.820
I came to Karasuno so I could beat him.

06:23.740 --> 06:28.030
So is beating Kageyama all you want out of volleyball?

06:28.780 --> 06:30.120
Um...

06:30.120 --> 06:32.540
<i>He's practicing on his lunch break?</i>

06:32.540 --> 06:35.500
I just want to be good enough to defeat Kageyama.

06:35.500 --> 06:39.920
That way, I could stand on equal footing with all kinds of formidable opponents.

06:40.630 --> 06:42.510
I wouldn't be easy to beat in a match.

06:43.050 --> 06:45.260
I don't want to lose anymore.

06:46.760 --> 06:47.890
I see...

06:48.390 --> 06:54.480
So basically, you think Kageyama's 
the best player in your grade, right?

06:56.900 --> 06:59.320
R-Right...

07:00.150 --> 07:02.570
<i>He sure doesn't like admitting it.</i>

07:03.240 --> 07:05.530
But hey, if he was your most formidable opponent,

07:05.860 --> 07:08.030
now he can be your most formidable ally.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.910
I don't think you're essential to winning.

07:15.330 --> 07:17.250
All right, let's get back to receiving!

07:17.250 --> 07:18.080
Okay!

07:22.510 --> 07:24.420
Thanks for taking out the trash!

07:29.680 --> 07:32.640
One, two, three, four.

07:32.640 --> 07:35.600
Five, six, seven, eight.

07:35.600 --> 07:38.650
Two, two, three, four.

07:38.650 --> 07:41.610
Five, six, seven, eight.

07:41.610 --> 07:45.530
Now stretch! One, two, three, four.

07:45.530 --> 07:48.660
Five, six, seven, eight.

07:48.660 --> 07:51.780
Two, two, three, four.

07:51.780 --> 07:54.660
Five, six, seven, eight.

07:57.710 --> 07:58.290
Let's go.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.000
Hey! Where to?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.460
There's not enough room to play ball here.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.510
I found a place we can practice.

08:07.840 --> 08:08.630
Where?

08:08.630 --> 08:10.550
Good job, Kageyama! Well done.

08:10.550 --> 08:12.680
Where do <i>you</i> get off acting all high and mighty?

08:12.680 --> 08:14.600
Don't get mad at every little thing.

08:41.170 --> 08:42.750
Maybe I studied too much.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.170
I-I think I did too...

08:44.170 --> 08:46.010
Yeah, right. Look who's talking!

08:46.010 --> 08:46.800
Huh?

08:46.800 --> 08:48.090
Excuse me.

08:48.090 --> 08:49.130
Oh, hey. You made it.

08:50.180 --> 08:52.090
These are the first-years who'll be joining us.

08:52.680 --> 08:55.140
Normally, new members wouldn't join until next week,

08:55.140 --> 08:59.560
but since we're having a match on Saturday, they'll be starting with us then.

08:55.510 --> 08:56.680
That guy's huge.

08:56.680 --> 08:57.350
Yeah.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.850
Pleased to meet you.

09:03.520 --> 09:05.110
Fight...

09:05.110 --> 09:07.150
Don't just use your hands. Move your feet.

09:08.780 --> 09:11.030
Come on. You need to focus.

09:11.030 --> 09:12.490
I know that.

09:13.490 --> 09:16.200
I'm gonna win this Saturday, be allowed into the gym,

09:17.370 --> 09:19.000
and join this team for real.

09:19.660 --> 09:23.710
Oh, I guess we also need to win so you can play setter.

09:23.710 --> 09:25.540
If you know that, then focus!

09:31.050 --> 09:34.720
I <i>told</i> you to take it easy when we practice outside!

09:35.260 --> 09:37.930
It'll be fine as long as you receive properly.

09:37.930 --> 09:40.640
Whatever, King.

09:41.640 --> 09:42.190
Hey.

09:43.310 --> 09:44.520
<i>Crap.</i>

09:48.690 --> 09:50.320
<i>What's his problem?</i>

09:50.320 --> 09:53.070
<i>He gets mad every time I call him King.</i>

09:53.070 --> 09:54.910
<i>It's a cool nickname, you know.</i>

09:55.620 --> 09:58.580
<i>I hope I get a cool nickname too.</i>

09:58.580 --> 10:00.870
<i>Just like the Little Giant.</i>

10:00.870 --> 10:03.870
<i>"Wind of the Fast Wind."</i>

10:03.870 --> 10:05.250
<i>Wait, that has "wind" twice...</i>

10:05.250 --> 10:08.210
<i>"The Forest's..." No, doesn't work.</i>

10:08.210 --> 10:10.340
<i>"The Jet Black..." Um...</i>

10:10.340 --> 10:12.550
<i>"The Northeast's Swooping..."</i>

10:12.550 --> 10:13.880
Hey, let's get back to it.

10:14.640 --> 10:17.930
O-Oh yeah. I wonder what our first-year opponents are like.

10:17.930 --> 10:19.600
I guess it'll be easier than the third-years.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.940
Who cares what they're like?

10:22.940 --> 10:24.940
We have no option but to win.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.730
Took the words right out of my mouth.

10:29.190 --> 10:30.780
Don't you cluck your tongue at me.

10:30.780 --> 10:31.990
Now bring it on!

10:34.030 --> 10:36.870
Hey. You're not supposed to receive with your face.

10:39.200 --> 10:42.330
I don't know why, but I just don't like those first-year newbies.

10:42.620 --> 10:46.210
You say that every time you meet someone new.

10:46.210 --> 10:48.630
I get it. That's how you're wired, right?

10:48.630 --> 10:49.800
Oh, come on...

10:50.250 --> 10:53.130
But I have to say, those guys were better than expected.

10:53.840 --> 10:55.470
I'm a little worried about Saturday's match.

10:55.470 --> 10:57.510
I-It'll be fine!

10:57.510 --> 10:59.310
I'll be playing too, you know.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.890
I guess. There's Kageyama too.

11:02.890 --> 11:07.350
Equipment Room

11:02.890 --> 11:07.350
Equipment Room

11:02.890 --> 11:07.350
m 846 373.5 l 844.5 460.5 1159.5 490.5 1161 406.5

11:03.480 --> 11:07.350
Don't you think Kageyama's 
mellowed out since junior high?

11:07.350 --> 11:09.110
What? How has he mellowed out at all?

11:09.110 --> 11:10.820
The guy's cocky as hell.

11:10.820 --> 11:13.650
Hmm... how do I put this?

11:13.650 --> 11:16.360
He had this unwavering confidence back when he was in junior high.

11:16.360 --> 11:17.820
He was like this phenom...

11:19.070 --> 11:21.290
Either way, he's cocky as hell.

11:21.290 --> 11:23.540
Sorry about that.

11:23.540 --> 11:25.870
I guess I asked the wrong guy.

11:25.870 --> 11:26.750
Huh?

11:36.220 --> 11:36.930
One...

11:38.140 --> 11:39.510
One more.

11:40.510 --> 11:41.260
Here goes.

11:41.260 --> 11:41.970
Okay.

11:43.600 --> 11:44.270
Go.

11:44.560 --> 11:45.390
The back.

11:45.390 --> 11:45.980
Got it.

11:48.560 --> 11:51.150
Wow, you're really practicing outside.

11:52.900 --> 11:56.150
Are you the first-years that stirred up trouble on the first day?

11:56.150 --> 11:58.030
T-shirts? How lame.

11:58.820 --> 12:00.570
<i>H-Huge...</i>

12:00.570 --> 12:02.790
Give it back.

12:02.790 --> 12:05.160
Don't you think it's about time 
grade schoolers ran along home?

12:07.290 --> 12:08.920
Who are you guys anyway?

12:08.920 --> 12:10.880
Are you the other first-years joining the team?

12:11.880 --> 12:12.340
Hey.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.460
<i>He's got height...</i>

12:13.460 --> 12:14.300
I was talking here—

12:14.300 --> 12:15.550
How tall are you?

12:15.550 --> 12:16.670
Hey.

12:16.670 --> 12:19.390
Tsukki is 188 cm.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.470
He'll be 190 soon.

12:21.470 --> 12:22.470
190?

12:22.470 --> 12:25.310
Why are <i>you</i> bragging?

12:25.310 --> 12:26.640
Sorry, Tsukki.

12:28.640 --> 12:31.230
You're Kageyama from Kitagawa First, aren't you?

12:31.810 --> 12:34.690
What's an elite player like you doing at Karasuno?

12:34.690 --> 12:35.440
Huh?

12:35.990 --> 12:37.030
Hey.

12:38.070 --> 12:40.360
We won't lose on Saturday, you hear me?

12:47.580 --> 12:48.370
Oh, is that so?

12:49.710 --> 12:52.840
It might be an important match for you two,

12:52.840 --> 12:55.670
but it doesn't matter to me at all.

12:55.670 --> 12:57.800
And I don't really care about winning or losing,

12:57.800 --> 12:59.680
so if you two really need to win,

13:01.010 --> 13:02.550
I can go easy on you if you like.

13:02.890 --> 13:04.260
Say what?!

13:05.100 --> 13:07.890
Whether you go easy or give it your all,

13:07.890 --> 13:10.190
the bottom line is I'll win.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.480
You mean "we"!

13:12.730 --> 13:14.110
Amazing confidence!

13:14.110 --> 13:16.030
You're the King, all right.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.360
Hey. Don't call me that!

13:19.360 --> 13:19.990
So it <i>is</i> true.

13:19.990 --> 13:20.650
What?

13:21.160 --> 13:24.620
The rumor that you lose it when
 you're called the King of the Court.

13:25.410 --> 13:26.830
What's wrong with King?

13:26.830 --> 13:28.040
It's cool.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.870
I think it suits you perfectly, King.

13:29.870 --> 13:31.580
<i>I should stay out of this.</i>

13:32.120 --> 13:34.130
What the hell do you want from me?

13:41.050 --> 13:44.010
I watched the finals of the 
prefectural qualifier tournament.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.560
That was some egocentric setting.

13:46.560 --> 13:49.180
I can't believe your teammates tolerated it,

13:49.180 --> 13:50.350
because I just couldn't.

13:50.350 --> 13:50.980
Oh, I get it!

13:51.730 --> 13:54.940
I guess what happened was because
 they couldn't tolerate it anymore, either.

13:58.980 --> 13:59.820
Tsukki.

14:05.910 --> 14:06.950
<i>What's going on?</i>

14:06.950 --> 14:09.040
<i>I don't know what they're talking about,</i>

14:09.040 --> 14:11.620
<i>but why is he holding back on this creepy guy?</i>

14:12.210 --> 14:16.090
<i>Tell him off like you usually would. Say something back at him!</i>

14:17.090 --> 14:18.090
Let's go.

14:19.880 --> 14:20.880
Hey!

14:20.880 --> 14:21.880
Running away?

14:21.880 --> 14:24.300
I guess the King isn't all he's cracked up to be.

14:25.340 --> 14:28.640
Maybe I'll beat the King this Saturday too.

14:33.020 --> 14:34.600
Shut up with the King crap.

14:35.560 --> 14:36.690
I'm here too.

14:37.020 --> 14:39.610
I'll spike the ball over your head during the match!

14:40.030 --> 14:40.860
Huh?

14:42.110 --> 14:44.280
What? You got a problem?

14:44.280 --> 14:45.860
You wanna fight, bastard?

14:48.240 --> 14:50.200
Don't get so worked up.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.790
Let's take it easy and have some fun.

14:53.250 --> 14:55.250
It's only a practice match, after all.

14:55.870 --> 14:57.130
What do you mean, "only"?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.000
I mean exactly that.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.170
See you later.

15:00.170 --> 15:01.210
Hey! Stop!

15:01.800 --> 15:04.260
Who <i>are</i> you guys?

15:04.260 --> 15:07.300
Class 1-4, Tsukishima Kei.

15:07.300 --> 15:08.680
I'm Yamaguchi Tadashi.

15:09.260 --> 15:11.850
We're your teammates starting today.

15:11.850 --> 15:13.730
Oh, but I suppose we're opponents for now.

15:14.310 --> 15:17.350
I'm looking forward to seeing the King's sets.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.150
See ya.

15:20.320 --> 15:23.940
Man, those guys totally give me the creeps.

15:23.940 --> 15:25.860
We've gotta beat the crap out of them.

15:25.860 --> 15:27.450
I don't need you to tell me that.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.990
Hey, where do you think you're going?

15:29.990 --> 15:30.580
Huh?

15:31.580 --> 15:33.250
We're not done yet.

15:37.460 --> 15:39.540
Tsukki, wait up. Is something the matter?

15:40.380 --> 15:43.670
Guys that get too worked up really get on my nerves.

15:44.920 --> 15:46.380
Like the King...

15:46.880 --> 15:48.390
and that shrimp...

15:55.390 --> 15:58.650
You take too long to get in position! I told you to focus!

15:56.480 --> 15:58.650
How much longer are they going to do this?

15:58.650 --> 16:00.060
I know that.

15:59.150 --> 16:01.900
Who knows?

16:01.900 --> 16:03.900
I'm so sleepy I can't stand it.

16:06.950 --> 16:07.740
King.

16:11.950 --> 16:12.990
Hey, Kageyama.

16:13.410 --> 16:15.450
It's too dark to see clearly.

16:15.450 --> 16:16.580
Don't hit it so hard.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.120
Sorry.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.420
<i>Scary. What's with him?</i>

16:23.420 --> 16:26.260
<i>If he's sorry, then he sure doesn't look it!</i>

16:26.260 --> 16:29.840
<i>His nerves have been on edge
 ever since he met that big guy.</i>

16:30.300 --> 16:34.600
<i>But if he doesn't set for me, I can't spike.</i>

16:34.600 --> 16:37.390
<i>I'll do my best at receiving till he does.</i>

16:37.390 --> 16:39.940
All right. Do that again.

18:14.780 --> 18:18.450
<i>He couldn't handle a serve like that before.</i>

18:18.790 --> 18:20.330
Hey, don't go easy on me!

18:21.460 --> 18:22.160
You asked for it!

18:24.960 --> 18:27.340
Crap, I overslept.

18:27.630 --> 18:30.920
I was runnin' down the road, tryin' to make it on time...

18:30.920 --> 18:34.800
When I ran into Kiyoko with toast in her mouth...

18:35.470 --> 18:36.600
I wish.

18:46.810 --> 18:48.940
How long have they been at it?

18:49.650 --> 18:51.940
It's been fifteen minutes since I got here.

18:51.940 --> 18:53.150
Fifteen minutes straight?

18:53.150 --> 18:53.860
Yeah.

18:53.860 --> 18:54.530
What?

18:56.370 --> 19:00.200
<i>His outstanding agility makes up for his lack of skill.</i>

19:00.200 --> 19:00.990
<i>But...</i>

19:00.990 --> 19:02.750
You must be at your limit now!

19:03.960 --> 19:04.790
Let's wrap it up—

19:04.790 --> 19:05.870
Not yet!

19:05.870 --> 19:08.250
I haven't let the ball hit the floor yet!

19:09.090 --> 19:09.920
Take that.

19:10.670 --> 19:13.010
Wow, bad form! How's he supposed to get that?

19:13.010 --> 19:14.420
<i>Crap! I didn't mean that...</i>

19:14.420 --> 19:18.390
Hinata's had amazing agility since he was in junior high.

19:18.720 --> 19:19.390
Huh?

19:19.390 --> 19:21.810
That's not all, though.

19:21.810 --> 19:25.600
I feel like he has the tenacity to become a winner.

19:26.650 --> 19:30.650
<i>It's not about being born with the right
 physique or having superior athleticism.</i>

19:30.650 --> 19:32.570
<i>His forte lies somewhere else.</i>

19:33.070 --> 19:34.150
<i>"I can't take it anymore."</i>

19:34.150 --> 19:35.950
<i>"I want to quit."</i>

19:35.950 --> 19:37.820
<i>When faced with such thoughts, he can...</i>

19:39.070 --> 19:40.080
<i>take that extra step.</i>

19:46.710 --> 19:47.670
He saved it.

19:47.960 --> 19:49.380
That's amazing, Hinata!

19:50.420 --> 19:53.840
I'll set for anyone I deem essential to winning.

19:54.300 --> 19:57.970
But right now, I don't think you are.

20:01.010 --> 20:02.930
I don't want to lose anymore.

20:05.770 --> 20:07.890
We haven't lost yet.

20:14.070 --> 20:15.240
A set?

20:15.240 --> 20:16.530
Kageyama set for him.

20:17.070 --> 20:20.490
Hinata is too worn out to spike, though.

20:32.920 --> 20:35.420
He sure can jump.

20:35.420 --> 20:37.300
He actually did it in that state.

20:38.260 --> 20:40.010
And look how happy he is.

20:40.930 --> 20:44.390
I think that meant something special to Hinata.

20:45.430 --> 20:47.600
But while they were good friends of mine,

20:48.310 --> 20:51.400
they were never really teammates.

20:51.650 --> 20:56.690
We take for granted that a setter will set for us, but for him...

20:57.690 --> 20:58.360
Hey.

21:00.570 --> 21:02.820
Let's win tomorrow.

21:04.580 --> 21:06.830
<i>But hey, if he was your most formidable opponent...</i>

21:08.370 --> 21:10.830
<i>Now he can be my most formidable ally.</i>

21:14.840 --> 21:16.800
O-Of course we will!

21:22.260 --> 21:25.470
Tanaka, get some water! And a washrag!

21:29.310 --> 21:33.270
<b>Miyagi Prefectural Karasuno High School</b>

21:29.310 --> 21:33.270
<b>Miyagi Prefectural Karasuno High School</b>

21:29.310 --> 21:33.270
<b>Miyagi Prefectural Karasuno High School</b>

21:43.110 --> 21:46.280
Wait up, you idiot!

21:48.250 --> 21:51.250
What's the point of getting worn out before the match?

21:51.710 --> 21:53.170
You'd better rest up.

21:55.500 --> 21:56.710
Damn...

21:56.710 --> 21:58.000
That was a draw.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.760
I won't ever lose to the likes of you.

22:01.760 --> 22:03.130
But...

22:05.680 --> 22:08.520
<i>He's irritating, and pisses me off...</i>

22:13.770 --> 22:16.730
<i>but he's going to set for me from now on.</i>

22:16.730 --> 22:18.190
<i>A setter's gonna set for me!</i>

22:19.190 --> 22:20.530
You and I are gonna win today.

22:24.530 --> 22:26.280
Let's get ready.

22:26.280 --> 22:27.410
Yeah.

22:27.410 --> 22:29.410
Morning, King.

22:34.870 --> 22:35.920
<i>This time...</i>

22:37.040 --> 22:39.130
<i>I'm gonna break through any wall that stands in my way!</i>

22:41.920 --> 22:41.920
{ED}

22:52.560 --> 22:56.480
If I tell you this story,

22:56.480 --> 23:00.230
I wonder if I can explain to you

23:00.730 --> 23:04.700
my feelings

23:04.700 --> 23:07.700
and the distance between us

23:08.410 --> 23:16.370
Standing on an empty field

23:16.710 --> 23:25.300
I breathe out into the night air

23:25.300 --> 23:29.850
Countless times I swore that I would change

23:29.850 --> 23:33.850
I stumbled and fell a lot,

23:33.850 --> 23:37.810
but I swore I would laugh at the end

23:37.810 --> 23:41.730
and not let my tears go to waste

23:41.730 --> 23:45.740
There are so many dreams that can definitely come true

23:45.740 --> 23:49.740
I always sat somewhere, downcast, dejected, depressed,

23:49.740 --> 23:52.290
but still I decided I would fight,

23:52.290 --> 23:57.290
and not let all my frustration go to waste

23:57.290 --> 24:01.630
This is our revenge
