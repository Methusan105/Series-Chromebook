No volleyball player is a soloist. They're all parts of a larger orchestra. It's all over the moment even one of them starts to believe he's "special."

00:20.040 --> 00:21.210
Move faster!

00:21.540 --> 00:22.750
Jump higher!

00:23.170 --> 00:24.750
More... more...

00:25.300 --> 00:26.460
Give me more!

00:33.850 --> 00:34.680
Why?

00:35.310 --> 00:36.850
Why won't you jump?

00:38.060 --> 00:40.060
We've had it up to here with you,

00:40.060 --> 00:42.190
you egocentric king!

00:55.870 --> 00:57.080
Good morning.

00:57.330 --> 00:58.450
Hey.

00:58.080 --> 01:00.330
It's that hottie. That hottie's here!

00:58.450 --> 01:00.670
Kiyoko, you look lovely today.

01:00.330 --> 01:02.580
Hey, think she might be the team manager?

01:00.670 --> 01:02.580
I love it when she ignores me!

01:04.540 --> 01:06.300
All right. Let's get started.

01:06.960 --> 01:09.340
I'll be on Tsukishima's team.

01:09.340 --> 01:11.130
Are you serious, Captain?!

01:11.760 --> 01:13.090
Relax.

01:13.090 --> 01:15.260
Tanaka's a better attacker than me.

01:15.970 --> 01:17.930
But know that I won't go easy on you guys.

01:20.180 --> 01:23.400
Out of the midget and Tanaka, which one should we target—

01:23.400 --> 01:24.810
er, keep in check first?

01:26.520 --> 01:28.150
Oh, how could I forget?

01:28.150 --> 01:31.030
We'd like to see the King on his knees in defeat too, right?

01:31.030 --> 01:35.160
Keep it down, Tsukki! What if they heard you?

01:35.160 --> 01:37.620
I <i>want</i> them to hear it, dude.

01:37.620 --> 01:40.540
I sure hope they lose their heads.

01:40.540 --> 01:43.750
I see you're quite the ass, Tsukishima.

01:43.750 --> 01:49.800
The lonesome king who lost all of his lackeys, in particular, is a sight for sore eyes.

01:50.670 --> 01:52.260
Goodness gracious me.

01:52.260 --> 01:53.930
Did you hear that?

01:53.930 --> 01:56.220
Can you believe what he just said?

01:56.220 --> 01:57.600
Jeez, that Tsukishima.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.770
He's <i>so</i>...

02:02.810 --> 02:04.480
dead!

02:05.980 --> 02:05.980
{OP}

02:10.610 --> 02:12.820
The heat flickers

02:12.820 --> 02:15.160
Sweat glitters on my skin

02:15.160 --> 02:20.040
Shouts echo and shoulders hit

02:20.040 --> 02:24.710
We asked the sky through the open window

02:20.160 --> 02:26.210

02:21.040 --> 02:26.210

Tell me, Mr. Future

02:30.800 --> 02:32.550
Come on, come on, come on

02:32.550 --> 02:35.130
The chance is there

02:35.550 --> 02:37.140
Come on, come on, come on

02:37.140 --> 02:39.310
Do it together

02:41.220 --> 02:45.810
Everybody always wants to stand there,

02:45.810 --> 02:50.530
make mistakes, get angry, and struggle

02:50.530 --> 02:51.860
We'll never give up

02:51.860 --> 02:55.320
We don't want it to end

02:55.320 --> 03:00.830
I will continue on with my imagination

03:02.330 --> 03:07.040
I want to struggle and fall and become stronger

03:07.040 --> 03:11.800
I want to persevere, stand back up, do it again,

03:11.800 --> 03:13.090
and never give up

03:13.090 --> 03:16.380
Let me run

03:16.380 --> 03:22.220
I will run to where my imagination leads me

03:35.990 --> 03:35.990
{Part A}

03:36.490 --> 03:40.490
Episode Four:
The View From the Summit

03:36.490 --> 03:40.490
Episode Four:
The View From the Summit

03:38.450 --> 03:40.660
Take this!

03:41.620 --> 03:43.580
He just destroyed that massive first-year.

03:43.580 --> 03:45.370
<i>He's putting in a lot more power than usual!</i>

03:45.370 --> 03:48.330
Hell yeah!

03:48.580 --> 03:49.460
Stop that, Tanaka.

03:49.460 --> 03:50.170
Tone it down, man.

03:50.170 --> 03:51.290
Keep your shirt on.

03:51.590 --> 03:54.300
Might've been a bad idea to provoke him.

03:57.010 --> 03:57.630
The front!

03:57.930 --> 03:58.680
Got it.

03:58.930 --> 03:59.840
<i>Me too...</i>

03:59.840 --> 04:00.640
<i>Me too!</i>

04:01.260 --> 04:02.010
Hinata!

04:02.010 --> 04:03.100
<i>He's gonna set for me too!</i>

04:03.390 --> 04:06.560
<i>And I'm gonna kick off my first match in high school with a bang—</i>

04:10.230 --> 04:11.440
<i>with my first spike!</i>

04:17.740 --> 04:18.700
<i>Not here too...</i>

04:19.070 --> 04:23.660
<i>There's a massive, massive wall in front of me again.</i>

04:24.160 --> 04:28.040
It really surprised me the other night as well, but boy, you sure can fly.

04:28.040 --> 04:32.880
Now if only you were just thirty centimeters taller,
 you could've been a superstar.

04:34.170 --> 04:36.300
<i>He may be huge, but he's only one guy.</i>

04:36.300 --> 04:38.010
O-Once more!

04:38.670 --> 04:39.970
<i>This time, I'll score!</i>

04:42.300 --> 04:43.640
Another block?

04:43.640 --> 04:47.100
<b>Kageyama/Hinata    Tsukishima/Yamaguchi</b>

04:43.640 --> 04:47.100
<b>Kageyama/Hinata    Tsukishima/Yamaguchi</b>

04:44.010 --> 04:45.970
How many does that make it, now?

04:45.100 --> 04:45.970
Nice, Tsukki.

04:45.970 --> 04:48.940
Tanaka seems to be scoring at will, though.

04:47.640 --> 04:48.940
Nice block, Tsukishima.

04:48.940 --> 04:50.390
Damn it!

04:50.900 --> 04:51.650
Thank you.

04:51.650 --> 04:54.270
<i>He's better than I expected.</i>

04:54.270 --> 04:55.270
Look at you.

04:55.270 --> 04:57.110
Your team keeps getting blocked.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.950
What happened to the King's sets?

04:59.950 --> 05:01.820
You know, the ones opponents can't keep up with.

05:02.160 --> 05:05.160
And the ones teammates can't keep up with, either.

05:05.160 --> 05:06.450
Shut up.

05:07.250 --> 05:08.500
Give us a good serve, Yamaguchi!

05:12.750 --> 05:14.750
S-Sorry, Tsukki.

05:15.460 --> 05:16.670
Don't worry about it.

05:18.090 --> 05:20.220
I don't need fast attacks

05:21.470 --> 05:22.510
to win.

05:23.930 --> 05:26.180
Give 'em the killer serve!

05:26.560 --> 05:28.770
<i>Kageyama's jump serve, huh?</i>

05:28.770 --> 05:30.140
<i>It was pretty overwhelming.</i>

05:30.430 --> 05:32.650
<i>I'm gonna score a bunch of points all at once!</i>

05:32.650 --> 05:33.480
<i>Go!</i>

05:35.820 --> 05:36.820
Ack.

05:37.190 --> 05:37.780
Yamaguchi.

05:37.780 --> 05:38.480
I got this, Tsukki!

05:41.030 --> 05:41.570
Dammit.

05:41.570 --> 05:42.490
Nice set, Tsukki.

05:42.490 --> 05:44.910
Steady receives are Daichi's forte.

05:42.820 --> 05:43.990
Good job, Yamaguchi.

05:45.370 --> 05:47.490
He's an incredible defender.

05:47.490 --> 05:49.500
Were you expecting to score a few points in a row?

05:50.750 --> 05:52.670
I don't have any outstanding talents,

05:52.670 --> 05:56.960
but I've spent two years more than you guys etching this receiving skill into my body.

05:58.170 --> 06:00.300
Don't think it's going down without a fight.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.510
S-So cool!

06:02.510 --> 06:03.880
Come on, King.

06:04.510 --> 06:07.010
Don't you think it's about time you pulled out all the stops?

06:07.010 --> 06:08.140
What's your problem, man?

06:08.140 --> 06:10.100
You keep trying to pick a fight with him.

06:10.100 --> 06:12.060
What the hell is the "King's set"?

06:12.060 --> 06:16.860
Don't you know why he's called the King?

06:17.480 --> 06:19.820
Well, for some reason, he's really good.

06:19.820 --> 06:23.570
The other schools must've gotten scared of his skills and named him that, no?

06:24.410 --> 06:27.580
I'm sure there are a lot of people who think that way,

06:28.080 --> 06:35.080
but rumor has it that he was given the nickname of 
"King of the Court" by the guys from Kitagawa First—

06:35.080 --> 06:37.340
the King's <i>teammates</i>.

06:38.130 --> 06:38.840
It means...

06:39.300 --> 06:41.260
"Egocentric King."

06:41.260 --> 06:43.170
"Oppressive Despot."

06:43.630 --> 06:48.550
I'd only heard rumors about it at first,
 but I was convinced after watching that match.

06:48.550 --> 06:52.810
He got so oppressive that they had to sub him out of the final.

06:53.980 --> 06:59.650
Kita First!

06:56.310 --> 06:59.070
Kousen Academy                       Kitagawa First

06:56.310 --> 06:59.070
Kousen Academy                       Kitagawa First

07:01.900 --> 07:03.070
All right!

07:03.070 --> 07:04.860
<i>Damn. They can block really high.</i>

07:05.360 --> 07:07.200
<i>We've gotta shake them off somehow.</i>

07:07.200 --> 07:08.820
<i>We need to attack much faster—</i>

07:08.820 --> 07:11.200
<i>fast enough to be unblockable.</i>

07:09.450 --> 07:10.660
Don't worry about it.

07:10.660 --> 07:11.200
Sorry.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.450
Faster!

07:13.790 --> 07:15.500
Give us a nice serve!

07:16.210 --> 07:16.920
Right!

07:19.590 --> 07:20.210
Yes!

07:20.210 --> 07:21.840
What the hell's wrong with you?

07:21.840 --> 07:23.420
Your sets are totally unreasonable!

07:23.760 --> 07:25.930
What's the point if we can't spike them?!

07:25.550 --> 07:27.300
All right! We only need one more point!

07:25.930 --> 07:29.390
<i>But we can't win unless we shake off their blocks!</i>

07:27.300 --> 07:28.720
Almost there, guys!

07:31.060 --> 07:32.560
<i>Is this the end?</i>

07:33.470 --> 07:35.020
<i>Am I going to lose here?</i>

07:35.690 --> 07:36.730
<i>Hell no!</i>

07:36.730 --> 07:38.690
<i>I'm gonna go to nationals!</i>

07:39.360 --> 07:40.650
Move faster!

07:40.650 --> 07:41.940
Jump higher!

07:41.940 --> 07:44.360
Keep up with my sets if you wanna win!

07:51.620 --> 07:53.580
<i>It was the first set.</i>

07:53.580 --> 07:55.580
<i>Our opponents were on set point.</i>

07:55.580 --> 07:57.120
<i>And when I made my set...</i>

08:02.000 --> 08:03.960
<i>there was nobody there to put it away.</i>

08:04.510 --> 08:07.840
<i>We'd made many mistakes transitioning that day,</i>

08:07.840 --> 08:10.390
<i>but what happened at the end wasn't a mistake.</i>

08:11.850 --> 08:13.640
<i>It was a rejection.</i>

08:13.640 --> 08:18.100
<i>A rally where they put their arms up and said, "We're not following you anymore."</i>

08:19.270 --> 08:20.350
Kageyama.

08:21.440 --> 08:24.190
Sub out now.

08:26.780 --> 08:28.360
That why you've stopped making quick sets?

08:29.070 --> 08:31.490
Are you chickening out due to what happened in that final?

08:33.950 --> 08:36.660
Hey, you've been running your mouth for a while now—

08:36.660 --> 08:37.660
Tanaka.

08:41.290 --> 08:43.880
If you make sets, but nobody jumps to hit them—

08:43.880 --> 08:45.090
That's right.

08:48.630 --> 08:51.890
The idea of making a set only to find that there's nobody there...

08:52.720 --> 08:54.430
terrifies me.

08:56.560 --> 08:58.890
But that was back in junior high, right?

09:01.480 --> 09:03.650
So long as he sets for me,

09:03.650 --> 09:05.020
I don't really care.

09:07.150 --> 09:10.200
Breaking through your guard is a far more pressing issue!

09:12.870 --> 09:15.580
We're gonna beat Tsukishima and join this team for real.

09:15.580 --> 09:17.910
You'll get to play setter with your head held high,

09:17.910 --> 09:19.370
and then you'll set for me.

09:19.750 --> 09:21.460
Does anything else matter?

09:23.460 --> 09:28.800
That kinda pure and straightforward shtick really gets on my nerves.

09:31.260 --> 09:33.720
Your spirit won't make up for your lack of height.

09:33.720 --> 09:36.430
If you think hard work trumps all else,

09:36.760 --> 09:38.390
then you're sorely mistaken.

09:39.980 --> 09:40.480
Got it.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.600
Tanaka.

09:41.600 --> 09:42.600
Gimme!

09:41.600 --> 09:42.600
Gimme!

09:43.020 --> 09:44.310
Bring it on!

09:44.310 --> 09:45.440
<i>Who should I set for?</i>

09:44.860 --> 09:46.150
Over here!

09:45.440 --> 09:48.070
<i>Hinata can't beat Tsukishima head-on yet.</i>

09:48.070 --> 09:48.440
Tanaka!

09:48.440 --> 09:49.240
Kageyama!

09:53.860 --> 09:56.580
<i>There was... nobody there...</i>

09:57.200 --> 09:58.240
I'm here!

10:06.380 --> 10:08.050
That was close.

10:08.050 --> 10:09.670
I nearly whiffed that one.

10:09.670 --> 10:11.090
It went out, though.

10:11.090 --> 10:12.300
What was that for?!

10:12.300 --> 10:13.340
But the ball <i>did</i> come to me!

10:14.590 --> 10:16.300
Who cares about junior high?

10:16.300 --> 10:18.390
I'll take whatever sets I can get.

10:18.760 --> 10:20.430
And I'll be grateful for all of them!

10:21.060 --> 10:22.350
I'll jump anywhere.

10:22.980 --> 10:24.400
I'll spike any ball!

10:25.060 --> 10:25.900
So...

10:27.820 --> 10:30.150
set for me!

10:31.150 --> 10:31.190
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:31.190 --> 10:31.240
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:31.240 --> 10:31.280
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:31.240 --> 10:31.280
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:31.280 --> 10:31.320
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:31.280 --> 10:31.320
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:31.320 --> 10:31.360
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:31.320 --> 10:31.360
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:31.360 --> 10:38.030
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:31.360 --> 10:38.030
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:38.030 --> 10:38.030
{Part B}

10:38.160 --> 10:38.200
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:38.200 --> 10:38.240
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:38.240 --> 10:38.280
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:38.240 --> 10:38.280
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:38.280 --> 10:38.330
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:38.280 --> 10:38.330
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:38.330 --> 10:38.370
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:38.330 --> 10:38.370
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:38.370 --> 10:45.040
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:38.370 --> 10:45.040
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:48.130 --> 10:52.210
<i>I'm pretty sure Kageyama was about to set for Tanaka there.</i>

10:52.630 --> 10:57.300
<i>But he still reacted instantly to Hinata's voice
 and movement and made such an accurate set.</i>

10:59.140 --> 11:02.430
<i>His foul mouth's been the only thing getting attention so far,</i>

11:03.100 --> 11:05.140
<i>but he really </i>is<i> amazing!</i>

11:05.140 --> 11:08.110
You guys can run quick plays?!

11:08.650 --> 11:09.360
"Quick plays"?

11:09.360 --> 11:11.690
Fast attacks like the one you just did!

11:11.690 --> 11:13.240
No way.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.660
I've only ever spiked slow and looping sets.

11:16.660 --> 11:18.200
But you just did it!

11:18.570 --> 11:23.120
Besides, didn't you once spike a messed-up set from that beginner on your junior high team?

11:23.120 --> 11:24.540
Stuff like that.

11:24.910 --> 11:27.080
Oh, I don't remember how I did that.

11:28.710 --> 11:31.000
But I'll spike any set that comes my way.

11:31.000 --> 11:31.840
You hear me?

11:33.880 --> 11:36.680
We've never practiced plays. 
Running a quick one is impossible.

11:38.090 --> 11:39.640
<i>Did he just say "impossible"?</i>

11:39.640 --> 11:41.850
<i>Does he even know what that word means?</i>

11:42.560 --> 11:44.100
You're being weird!

11:44.100 --> 11:46.440
You're acting so timid it's giving me the creeps! Weirdo!

11:46.440 --> 11:47.810
Oh, shut it.

11:49.770 --> 11:52.150
This isn't like you, King.

11:52.150 --> 11:54.490
Just you wait! I'm gonna break through your defenses!

11:54.490 --> 11:57.110
There you go, getting all worked up again.

11:57.860 --> 12:01.120
"Try and try until you succeed" sounds nice on paper, 
but it doesn't always work like that.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.290
Everyone has things they're just not cut out for.

12:04.620 --> 12:07.750
And you're clearly not fit to be a spiker.

12:09.540 --> 12:10.750
Maybe.

12:10.750 --> 12:17.130
I mean, be it back in junior high or in this match, 
I kept getting blocked no matter how much I jumped.

12:18.340 --> 12:21.010
And I know that a volleyball player needs to be tall.

12:21.010 --> 12:24.890
Doesn't matter how high you can jump. 
It'll never make up for a massive difference in height.

12:26.810 --> 12:27.690
Even so,

12:28.770 --> 12:31.230
I ended up wanting to be like that!

12:32.650 --> 12:35.690
So I don't care if I'm disadvantaged or not cut out for it.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.240
I wanna fight using my own body.

12:39.240 --> 12:40.450
I wanna keep winning...

12:40.950 --> 12:43.490
and stay on the court as much as I can!

12:51.830 --> 12:52.840
<i>No way.</i>

12:53.710 --> 12:54.800
<i>I still...</i>

12:55.750 --> 12:58.380
<i>I still wanna stand on the court!</i>

13:02.930 --> 13:05.430
But you don't have the means to do so.

13:05.430 --> 13:07.350
We're not talking psychology here.

13:07.730 --> 13:09.980
Your feelings aren't gonna make up for your lack of height.

13:09.980 --> 13:12.560
Though I guess it's a different story if you wanna be a libero.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.940
<i>Set for me!</i>

13:20.570 --> 13:23.410
Breaking through the wall that stands in the spiker's way...

13:26.540 --> 13:28.370
is what a setter is for!

13:34.380 --> 13:36.000
Wh-What is it, Kageyama?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.500
Hey, that hurts!

13:37.500 --> 13:39.420
Lemme go!

13:37.760 --> 13:39.420
Calm down, Kageyama!

13:40.090 --> 13:41.550
What are you—

13:41.550 --> 13:42.260
Listen up.

13:43.050 --> 13:44.930
If we can't break through, we'll just have to go around.

13:44.930 --> 13:48.930
Use every last bit of your agility and reflexes to spike my sets.

13:48.930 --> 13:51.440
Is <i>that</i> how you explain a quick attack?!

13:51.440 --> 13:51.890
Gotcha.

13:51.890 --> 13:53.690
Pull the other one! You didn't get a thing!

13:54.190 --> 13:55.440
We'll just try it anyway!

13:55.860 --> 13:57.020
What's gotten into <i>you</i>?

13:57.020 --> 13:59.740
You were totally depressed just a minute ago.

13:59.740 --> 14:00.570
I wasn't.

14:00.570 --> 14:01.400
Pull the other one!

14:01.400 --> 14:03.570
All right.

14:01.820 --> 14:02.820
Give us a good serve!

14:03.570 --> 14:05.370
Let's do this.

14:05.370 --> 14:09.080
<i>Considering his speed and reflexes,
 he should be able to spike quick sets.</i>

14:11.410 --> 14:14.000
<i>Okay, bring on the sets. Bring 'em on anywhere!</i>

14:14.000 --> 14:15.460
Give us a good serve, Tsukki!

14:14.920 --> 14:18.420
<i>We haven't even figured out the signs yet, but whatever.</i>

14:19.130 --> 14:21.470
<i>Oh, so he's gonna make a set there.</i>

14:23.680 --> 14:24.720
Hinata.

14:24.090 --> 14:26.510
<i>Great. That serve's not as good as Mrs. Yoshida's.</i>

14:26.510 --> 14:28.390
<i>Now I just gotta jump over here...</i>

14:32.270 --> 14:34.600
<i>Huh? It's </i>that<i> fast?</i>

14:34.600 --> 14:35.690
What's wrong with you?!

14:35.690 --> 14:36.810
Move faster—

14:38.650 --> 14:40.360
Oh, look. There's the King's set.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.400
As if it was ever gonna work right off the bat!

14:43.400 --> 14:45.110
I'm not sure it ever will.

14:48.700 --> 14:50.290
Yay, I touched it!

14:52.200 --> 14:53.500
What are you, a fish?!

14:55.540 --> 14:57.960
Man, I have no idea what the right timing is.

14:58.250 --> 15:02.050
Dude, you have incredible reflexes! Be more like, "bam"! Wham!

15:02.050 --> 15:04.220
Bam or wham? Pick one!

15:04.220 --> 15:06.430
That's not the point!

15:06.430 --> 15:07.340
Kageyama.

15:09.260 --> 15:11.270
You're repeating what you did in junior high.

15:12.310 --> 15:14.230
Uh, well...

15:14.230 --> 15:18.230
Hinata's got reflexes, speed, and an amazing vertical.

15:18.230 --> 15:19.610
If he can get used to quick plays...

15:20.150 --> 15:24.990
Don't you think your sets are hindering his agility?

15:26.910 --> 15:29.450
Hinata has neither volleyball skills nor experience.

15:29.450 --> 15:30.780
Sugawara?

15:30.780 --> 15:35.120
He's not like your talented junior high teammates.

15:35.750 --> 15:37.080
But he's got great potential.

15:37.080 --> 15:40.420
Me? A prodigy? No way!

15:40.420 --> 15:41.550
He didn't call you one.

15:42.210 --> 15:44.050
With your skills,

15:44.380 --> 15:51.100
can't you take his unique, uh, talents and... well...

15:51.100 --> 15:52.060
Uh...

15:52.060 --> 15:53.520
Hang in there, Suga!

15:53.770 --> 15:56.100
Can't you put them to good use?

15:58.980 --> 16:04.320
I'm a setter too, so when I watched 
that match last year, I was intimidated.

16:05.070 --> 16:08.240
By your outstanding playmaking, ball control,

16:08.700 --> 16:09.950
and most of all...

16:10.620 --> 16:14.490
your vision and decision-making ability that let 
you see right through your opponents' defense.

16:14.950 --> 16:17.920
I don't have any of that.

16:17.920 --> 16:19.670
That's not true, Suga—

16:19.670 --> 16:20.460
Tanaka.

16:20.460 --> 16:21.920
Let's hear him out.

16:23.130 --> 16:24.760
You have the skills,

16:24.760 --> 16:27.170
the motivation to win,

16:27.170 --> 16:31.090
and above all, incredible vision.

16:31.470 --> 16:33.600
There's no way you can't see 
through your own teammates!

16:38.730 --> 16:40.730
<i>Put him to good use?</i>

16:40.730 --> 16:41.900
<i>But how?!</i>

16:42.610 --> 16:44.150
But the ball <i>did</i> come to me!

16:51.200 --> 16:51.820
I...

16:51.820 --> 16:53.080
Y-Yeah?

16:53.490 --> 16:55.620
I envy your athleticism.

16:55.620 --> 16:56.450
What?

16:56.450 --> 16:59.540
It pisses me off that you're letting it all go to waste.

16:59.540 --> 17:00.370
Excuse me?

17:00.370 --> 17:04.710
So I'm gonna put all of your abilities to good use.

17:05.750 --> 17:06.670
What the?

17:08.720 --> 17:12.550
Give me your top speed and your best jumps.

17:13.430 --> 17:15.140
And I'll send the ball your way.

17:16.310 --> 17:18.100
Send it my way?

17:18.100 --> 17:19.060
What do you mean?

17:19.640 --> 17:24.520
Just run as fast as you can to an area
 they're not marking, jump as high as you can,

17:24.520 --> 17:26.020
and swing your arm as hard as you can.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.490
No need to keep an eye on my sets.

17:28.490 --> 17:30.110
No need to care about what the ball's doing.

17:30.110 --> 17:31.450
Say what?

17:31.450 --> 17:32.990
I'll just swing and miss if I don't watch.

17:32.990 --> 17:33.490
Maybe.

17:33.490 --> 17:34.070
Hey!

17:34.070 --> 17:36.290
But I still wanna try this.

17:39.540 --> 17:40.710
Gotcha.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.250
They're still up to something?

17:43.250 --> 17:46.500
I wish they'd hurry up and figure out that nobody can hit the King's egocentric sets.

17:46.500 --> 17:47.420
You can say that again.

17:47.960 --> 17:49.800
<i>What are they trying to do?</i>

17:49.800 --> 17:54.010
<i>At the very least, there's no way Hinata can keep up with those sets right now.</i>

17:54.010 --> 17:55.970
Give us a good serve!

17:54.010 --> 17:55.970
<b>Kageyama/Hinata    Tsukishima/Yamaguchi</b>

17:54.010 --> 17:55.970
<b>Kageyama/Hinata    Tsukishima/Yamaguchi</b>

18:03.230 --> 18:05.110
<i>What amazing concentration...</i>

18:07.270 --> 18:08.190
<i>Watch.</i>

18:08.190 --> 18:09.360
<i>See through it!</i>

18:09.740 --> 18:11.070
<i>Where are the blockers?</i>

18:11.070 --> 18:12.610
<i>Where's the ball?</i>

18:12.610 --> 18:14.280
<i>Where's the spiker?</i>

18:14.280 --> 18:16.240
<i>What will he do next?</i>

18:16.240 --> 18:17.870
<i>Where will he jump?</i>

18:17.870 --> 18:19.950
<i>Where is the absolute peak of his jump?</i>

18:21.080 --> 18:21.830
<i>This is it!</i>

18:22.160 --> 18:25.130
<i>This is the position, the timing, and the angle!</i>

18:28.170 --> 18:28.710
Yeah!

18:32.800 --> 18:33.800
It...

18:34.090 --> 18:35.800
It hit my hand!

18:36.930 --> 18:38.810
He's so melodramatic.

18:38.810 --> 18:39.770
Hey...

18:40.600 --> 18:43.560
Hinata had his eyes closed just now!

18:45.060 --> 18:46.900
Um, what do you mean?

18:47.610 --> 18:52.860
He kept his eyes closed from the moment he jumped to the moment he hit the ball.

18:53.280 --> 18:59.580
That means Kageyama made a pinpoint set into
 Hinata's palm when he wasn't even looking at the ball!

18:59.580 --> 19:03.370
And he delivered it with perfect accuracy 
at the exact moment Hinata swung his arm.

19:06.420 --> 19:07.670
Awesome!

19:07.960 --> 19:09.540
What was that just now?

19:09.540 --> 19:12.800
The ball just hit my hand!

19:12.800 --> 19:14.300
Hey!

19:14.300 --> 19:15.970
Why did you have your eyes closed?!

19:15.970 --> 19:17.890
<i>You</i> told me not to look at the ball.

19:17.890 --> 19:21.430
I end up ball watching when my eyes are open, so I closed them.

19:21.430 --> 19:22.970
I did say that, but...

19:23.520 --> 19:24.940
But hey, we pulled it off.

19:24.940 --> 19:26.190
What's the problem?

19:26.190 --> 19:30.900
Yeah, we did, but who the hell
 trusts another guy completely?!

19:30.900 --> 19:34.320
I don't know what else to do right now!

19:35.900 --> 19:37.780
<i>You suck!</i>

19:38.200 --> 19:40.950
<i>What have you been doing for the last three years?!</i>

19:41.490 --> 19:44.370
<i>I can bring his vertical and his agility to life</i>

19:41.910 --> 19:44.910
What the hell was that, dude? It was amazing!

19:45.370 --> 19:47.170
<i>with my sets!</i>

19:48.880 --> 19:49.840
Good.

19:49.840 --> 19:54.210
If Hinata can land his spikes, the markers will split up, which will make it easier for Tanaka to score too.

19:54.210 --> 19:54.710
Yeah!

19:54.710 --> 19:55.720
Great!

19:55.720 --> 19:58.680
There's absolutely no camaraderie between us,

20:00.390 --> 20:02.430
but know that I'll keep sending the ball your way.

20:03.060 --> 20:04.850
Trust me and jump.

20:04.850 --> 20:05.640
'Kay.

20:09.020 --> 20:09.440
<i>Now!</i>

20:11.480 --> 20:12.150
My bad.

20:12.150 --> 20:20.620
<b>Kageyama/Hinata    Tsukishima/Yamaguchi</b>

20:12.150 --> 20:20.620
<b>Kageyama/Hinata    Tsukishima/Yamaguchi</b>

20:13.400 --> 20:15.610
Was that earlier one just a fluke?

20:15.610 --> 20:18.860
His sets are definitely getting more accurate.

20:18.860 --> 20:20.120
Really?

20:20.120 --> 20:20.620
Yeah.

20:20.990 --> 20:21.950
Here, Hinata.

20:21.700 --> 20:22.870
<i>Dammit.</i>

20:21.950 --> 20:24.160
Oh, thanks.

20:22.870 --> 20:24.830
<i>I set it too far from the net this time.</i>

20:24.830 --> 20:25.580
Ouch.

20:25.580 --> 20:27.790
<i>This is harder than I thought.</i>

20:27.790 --> 20:31.170
<i>It's also a pain to keep track of everything that's happening on the court.</i>

20:28.790 --> 20:29.960
Are you all right?

20:29.960 --> 20:31.170
Y-Yeah!

20:32.000 --> 20:34.670
<i>But it's so much fun!</i>

20:34.670 --> 20:36.670
The hell are you grinning for?

20:36.670 --> 20:38.630
Screw you! That's the second time you hit my face!

20:39.300 --> 20:41.010
I can't believe this.

20:41.010 --> 20:43.050
That one earlier was just dumb luck.

20:43.050 --> 20:45.470
Yet they keep trying it over and over.

20:45.470 --> 20:50.600
Hinata'll probably keep jumping without looking at the ball.

20:51.020 --> 20:53.480
You're not doing this on purpose, are you?

20:51.690 --> 20:53.820
Yeah, it certainly is unbelievable.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.480
You know we've gotta win this, right?

20:53.820 --> 20:58.320
It's not that easy to trust someone completely.

20:55.480 --> 20:56.650
Of course!

20:58.320 --> 21:00.740
Especially not the guy you consider your greatest rival.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.410
Damn, this just isn't working.

21:05.120 --> 21:06.040
Still...

21:06.700 --> 21:12.040
<i>That sensation when I hit the ball 
right in the sweet spot was amazing.</i>

21:13.040 --> 21:14.710
<i>I just love how it feels!</i>

21:16.170 --> 21:19.170
<i>One more time.</i>

21:19.170 --> 21:21.340
<i>One more time, carefully...</i>

21:21.680 --> 21:25.310
<i>I need to make a set that allows the
 spiker to show the best of his ability.</i>

21:26.470 --> 21:27.970
I got this!

21:27.970 --> 21:29.270
Nice receive!

21:29.270 --> 21:31.850
I bet he's gonna mess up trying to set for that midget again.

21:31.850 --> 21:33.690
We just need to mark Tanaka—

21:35.150 --> 21:36.110
Get over here!

21:37.860 --> 21:38.900
<i>A wall...</i>

21:39.780 --> 21:40.530
Listen up.

21:40.530 --> 21:41.860
If we can't break through...

21:42.860 --> 21:43.870
<i>...we'll just have to go around!</i>

21:47.370 --> 21:49.620
<i>So what if I'm not as tall as the others?</i>

21:50.460 --> 21:52.540
<i>I'll just jump one centimeter, one millimeter higher...</i>

21:52.540 --> 21:53.880
<i>or be one second faster...</i>

21:55.170 --> 21:56.250
<i>to the peak!</i>

21:56.630 --> 21:59.590
<i>That way, for that one moment,</i>

22:00.090 --> 22:01.970
<i>I'll be at the highest point on the court!</i>

22:03.840 --> 22:07.260
<i>A massive, massive wall stands 
in front of me, blocking my way.</i>

22:07.260 --> 22:10.390
<i>I wonder what the view is like on the other side.</i>

22:10.390 --> 22:12.100
<i>What does it look like?</i>

22:12.940 --> 22:15.810
<i>The view from the summit—</i>

22:16.980 --> 22:17.770
<i>it's something...</i>

22:22.200 --> 22:23.490
<i>I'll never be able to see alone.</i>

22:39.500 --> 22:40.630
Yes!

22:42.050 --> 22:42.050
{ED}

22:52.680 --> 22:56.610
If I tell you this story,

22:56.610 --> 23:00.360
I wonder if I can explain to you

23:00.860 --> 23:04.820
my feelings

23:04.820 --> 23:07.820
and the distance between us

23:08.530 --> 23:16.500
Standing on an empty field

23:16.830 --> 23:25.430
I breathe out into the night air

23:25.430 --> 23:29.930
Countless times I swore that I would change

23:29.930 --> 23:33.980
I stumbled and fell a lot,

23:33.980 --> 23:37.940
but I swore I would laugh at the end

23:37.940 --> 23:41.860
and not let my tears go to waste

23:41.860 --> 23:45.860
There are so many dreams that can definitely come true

23:45.860 --> 23:49.870
I always sat somewhere, downcast, dejected, depressed,

23:49.870 --> 23:52.410
but still I decided I would fight,

23:52.410 --> 23:57.420
and not let all my frustration go to waste

23:57.420 --> 24:01.750
This is our revenge
