00:10.870 --> 00:12.910
<i>That was a perfect receive.</i>

00:14.950 --> 00:16.580
<i>Could he be...</i>

00:20.830 --> 00:22.840
You're shorter than me?

00:23.170 --> 00:25.710
What the hell did you just say?!

00:25.710 --> 00:26.800
S-Sorry!

00:26.800 --> 00:29.010
Um...

00:29.010 --> 00:31.220
How tall are you?

00:32.390 --> 00:34.220
159 cm!

00:34.640 --> 00:36.930
<i>H-He's in the 150s!</i>

00:38.810 --> 00:39.940
What's with you?

00:39.940 --> 00:44.110
This is the first time I've looked down at
 someone since I joined a high school team!

00:44.110 --> 00:45.480
Quit shedding tears of joy!

00:45.480 --> 00:47.150
You're barely taller than me!

00:48.860 --> 00:50.610
Oh, hey, Noya!

00:50.990 --> 00:52.570
Hey, Ryuu!

00:52.950 --> 00:54.280
Nishinoya!

00:54.280 --> 00:55.660
Hello!

00:55.660 --> 00:57.540
Oh yeah, you haven't met him before.

00:57.910 --> 00:59.330
This is Nishinoya, a second-year.

00:59.330 --> 01:00.290
Hello!

01:00.290 --> 01:02.630
Yo! You guys are first-years, huh?

01:02.630 --> 01:05.880
You there, the tall guy with the mean look who served earlier.

01:06.210 --> 01:07.550
What junior high are you from?

01:08.460 --> 01:09.720
Kitagawa First.

01:09.720 --> 01:10.680
For real?

01:10.680 --> 01:11.880
That's a powerhouse team!

01:11.880 --> 01:13.340
No wonder you had a killer serve.

01:13.760 --> 01:16.810
I had to play them back in junior high and lost 2-1!

01:17.100 --> 01:20.230
They had a third-year with a killer serve back then too.

01:18.930 --> 01:20.770
He's as loud as ever.

01:21.060 --> 01:24.690
What... What junior high did you go to?

01:24.690 --> 01:25.940
Chidoriyama.

01:26.650 --> 01:28.230
That's a powerhouse in its own right!

01:28.230 --> 01:29.490
Why'd you come to Karasuno?

01:29.900 --> 01:32.910
Was it because you heard that Coach Ukai was coming out of retirement too?

01:34.120 --> 01:35.330
Nah.

01:35.330 --> 01:37.450
The reason I came to Karasuno...

01:41.290 --> 01:44.630
was because the girls' uniform was right down my alley.

01:46.710 --> 01:50.010
Of course, the girls themselves didn't let me down either.

01:50.010 --> 01:51.340
The biggest reason, though,

01:52.840 --> 01:55.720
was the boys' uniform. Guys have gotta wear black, yo.

01:56.050 --> 01:59.220
I had to put up with blazers in junior high, so I always wanted to wear these.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.100
And not in brown or gray, either. It had to be black!

02:01.100 --> 02:02.270
I hear ya!

02:02.600 --> 02:07.070
Karasuno had black uniforms, the girls' uniform was cute, <i>and</i> it was close to my place.

02:07.070 --> 02:08.820
It was an easy decision to make.

02:10.690 --> 02:12.110
Kiyoko!

02:12.110 --> 02:14.160
I crossed the seven seas to come see you!

02:15.740 --> 02:17.990
As usual, the guy's like a hurricane.

02:16.990 --> 02:18.490
More like a guerrilla downpour.

02:19.410 --> 02:20.620
I bet you think he's rowdy.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.580
But, you know, he has a shockingly

02:24.710 --> 02:25.750
calm game.

02:26.920 --> 02:29.880
So, where's Asahi? Is he back yet?

02:31.460 --> 02:32.260
Nah.

02:36.050 --> 02:38.100
That gutless wuss!

02:38.100 --> 02:39.390
Cut that out, Noya!

02:39.390 --> 02:41.020
Don't call your senior a wuss!

02:41.020 --> 02:42.520
Shut up!

02:42.520 --> 02:44.480
A wuss is a wuss!

02:44.770 --> 02:47.730
If Asahi ain't coming back, then neither am I.

02:47.730 --> 02:48.650
Hey, wait!

02:48.650 --> 02:49.730
Noya!

02:52.030 --> 02:52.030
{OP}

02:56.660 --> 02:58.870
The heat flickers

02:58.870 --> 03:01.200
Sweat glitters on my skin

03:01.200 --> 03:06.080
Shouts echo and shoulders hit

03:06.080 --> 03:10.750
We asked the sky through the open window

03:06.210 --> 03:12.260
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

03:07.080 --> 03:12.260
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

Tell me, Mr. Future

03:16.840 --> 03:18.590
Come on, come on, come on

03:18.590 --> 03:21.180
The chance is there

03:21.600 --> 03:23.180
Come on, come on, come on

03:23.180 --> 03:25.350
Do it together

03:27.270 --> 03:31.860
Everybody always wants to stand there,

03:31.860 --> 03:36.570
make mistakes, get angry, and struggle

03:36.570 --> 03:37.910
We'll never give up

03:37.910 --> 03:41.370
We don't want it to end

03:41.370 --> 03:46.870
I will continue on with my imagination

03:48.370 --> 03:53.090
I want to struggle and fall and become stronger

03:53.090 --> 03:57.800
I want to persevere, stand back up, do it again,

03:57.800 --> 03:59.140
and never give up

03:59.140 --> 04:02.430
Let me run

04:02.430 --> 04:08.270
I will run to where my imagination leads me

04:21.990 --> 04:21.990
{Part A}

04:25.620 --> 04:29.670
<i>My only job is to keep the rally going.</i>

04:30.420 --> 04:32.840
<i>The skies are the spikers' domain.</i>

04:32.840 --> 04:35.170
<i>It's not a place where I can fight,</i>

04:36.550 --> 04:39.430
<i>but so long as I keep the rally going,</i>

04:40.260 --> 04:42.430
<i>our ace will definitely score.</i>

04:43.140 --> 04:45.180
<i>Even if your spike runs into a brick wall,</i>

04:45.850 --> 04:47.930
<i>I'll dig it out for sure this time.</i>

04:48.810 --> 04:50.100
<i>So please...</i>

04:51.270 --> 04:53.230
<i>Please call for a set once again,</i>

04:53.900 --> 04:54.820
<i>ace!</i>

04:59.110 --> 05:03.120
Episode Eight:
The One They Call "Ace"

04:59.110 --> 05:03.120
Episode Eight:
The One They Call "Ace"

04:59.820 --> 05:01.110
H-Hey...

05:02.870 --> 05:05.330
Nishiya, you're a libero, right?

05:05.330 --> 05:06.870
A defensive specialist.

05:06.870 --> 05:08.500
The name's Nishi<i>no</i>ya.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.460
Why do you think I'm a libero?

05:10.460 --> 05:11.540
Because I'm short?

05:11.870 --> 05:13.250
N-No.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.170
Because you're a good receiver.

05:15.960 --> 05:19.300
And I know libero's a position for good receivers, dude.

05:19.300 --> 05:21.220
Uh, scratch that last part.

05:21.220 --> 05:24.180
Wow, you know your stuff.

05:24.510 --> 05:28.100
Also, the captain called you our guardian angel.

05:28.100 --> 05:28.720
Gua—

05:28.720 --> 05:30.690
Wh-What the hell?

05:30.690 --> 05:33.850
Giving me a fancy title isn't gonna sway me!

05:36.150 --> 05:37.440
Did he really call me that?

05:37.440 --> 05:38.780
Yeah.

05:39.110 --> 05:41.860
That cool title isn't gonna change anything!

05:41.860 --> 05:43.950
I won't give in so easily!

05:43.950 --> 05:46.580
Damn that Daichi!

05:46.580 --> 05:49.040
I still suck at receiving, you see.

05:49.620 --> 05:52.160
Even though it's the most important part of volleyball.

05:53.710 --> 05:56.250
So please teach me how, Nishi—

05:56.750 --> 05:57.960
Nishinoya, sir!

05:57.960 --> 06:00.380
Sir!

06:04.390 --> 06:05.470
Hey...

06:07.720 --> 06:10.890
I'll buy you ice cream after practice.

06:11.560 --> 06:13.100
After all,

06:14.350 --> 06:16.310
I'm your upperclassman!

06:17.320 --> 06:18.270
Does that mean...

06:18.770 --> 06:21.070
No, that doesn't mean I'm rejoining the team.

06:21.070 --> 06:23.200
I'm just gonna teach you, is all.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.530
Thank you!

06:28.660 --> 06:31.370
Look, basically...

06:31.370 --> 06:34.620
You just have go like zoom, whoosh, and bam.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.040
Like so.

06:38.210 --> 06:39.250
This isn't working.

06:39.250 --> 06:42.470
Nobody can understand what he's saying because he moves on pure instinct.

06:42.470 --> 06:43.880
Really?

06:43.880 --> 06:45.840
I kinda got it.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.760
Well, you're one of his kind.

06:47.760 --> 06:51.720
Your explanations are all "bam" and "wham" too!

06:51.720 --> 06:53.850
Nobody ever understands that crap.

06:54.850 --> 06:57.980
If I recall correctly, libero's a specialized position, right?

06:57.980 --> 06:58.730
Right.

06:58.810 --> 06:58.860
<b>Libero</b>

06:58.810 --> 06:58.860
<b>Libero</b>

06:58.810 --> 06:58.860
<b>Libero</b>

06:58.860 --> 06:58.900
<b>Libero</b>

06:58.860 --> 06:58.900
<b>Libero</b>

06:58.860 --> 06:58.900
<b>Libero</b>

06:58.900 --> 06:58.940
<b>Libero</b>

06:58.900 --> 06:58.940
<b>Libero</b>

06:58.900 --> 06:58.940
<b>Libero</b>

06:58.940 --> 06:58.980
<b>Libero</b>

06:58.940 --> 06:58.980
<b>Libero</b>

06:58.940 --> 06:58.980
<b>Libero</b>

06:58.980 --> 06:59.020
<b>Libero</b>

06:58.980 --> 06:59.020
<b>Libero</b>

06:58.980 --> 06:59.020
<b>Libero</b>

06:59.020 --> 06:59.070
<b>Libero</b>

06:59.020 --> 06:59.070
<b>Libero</b>

06:59.020 --> 06:59.070
<b>Libero</b>

06:59.070 --> 06:59.110
<b>Libero</b>

06:59.070 --> 06:59.110
<b>Libero</b>

06:59.070 --> 06:59.110
<b>Libero</b>

06:59.110 --> 06:59.150
<b>Libero</b>

06:59.110 --> 06:59.150
<b>Libero</b>

06:59.110 --> 06:59.150
<b>Libero</b>

06:59.150 --> 07:00.520
<b>Libero</b>

06:59.150 --> 07:00.520
<b>Libero</b>

06:59.150 --> 07:00.520
<b>Libero</b>

06:59.520 --> 07:00.900
Libero:

07:00.900 --> 07:02.740
a player who specializes in defense.

07:02.740 --> 07:05.860
They're barred from making any 
offensive plays like serving or spiking,

07:05.860 --> 07:08.950
but they can replace any player in the back row to strengthen the defense.

07:09.370 --> 07:11.740
So he literally <i>is</i> Karasuno's guardian angel.

07:11.740 --> 07:13.250
How cool!

07:13.250 --> 07:16.920
It'd be truly reassuring if he came back.

07:17.290 --> 07:20.460
He may be small in stature, 
but his presence is overwhelming.

07:17.290 --> 07:20.460
You're pretty big. How tall are you?

07:20.460 --> 07:21.050
Oh, Tsukki's—

07:21.050 --> 07:22.340
Shut up, Yamaguchi.

07:21.380 --> 07:24.130
It gives us peace of mind.

07:22.340 --> 07:24.130
Sorry about that.

07:24.590 --> 07:27.930
Man, Nishinoya hasn't lost his touch at all.

07:27.930 --> 07:30.510
Apparently he was training even while he was suspended.

07:30.510 --> 07:32.470
He played with volleyball moms and stuff.

07:33.680 --> 07:34.850
Sounds like Hinata.

07:35.770 --> 07:37.440
Um, Nishinoya.

07:38.400 --> 07:41.110
Who's this Asahi you were talking about earlier?

07:41.110 --> 07:43.530
Don't bring his name up just like that, moron!

07:45.950 --> 07:48.490
Karasuno's ace. At least on paper.

07:49.070 --> 07:49.950
Ace?

07:50.740 --> 07:52.330
<i>So we </i>do<i> have one.</i>

07:53.620 --> 07:55.870
What's with the blank look?

07:55.870 --> 07:58.500
I wanna be the ace!

08:00.000 --> 08:02.590
The ace? With <i>your</i> height?

08:05.720 --> 08:07.800
I like you, dude!

08:07.800 --> 08:10.590
I hear ya! Being the ace has gotta be so cool, right?

08:10.590 --> 08:11.640
Sure, why not?

08:11.640 --> 08:13.640
Do it! Become the ace!

08:13.640 --> 08:16.850
You seem way more promising than our current one!

08:18.600 --> 08:21.690
But man, everyone dreams of being the ace, huh?

08:21.690 --> 08:23.900
Yeah, aces are cool!

08:23.900 --> 08:26.860
Just the word "ace" has a cool ring to it.

08:26.860 --> 08:29.780
"Setter" and "libero" sound so boring in comparison.

08:30.570 --> 08:31.870
There, there.

08:32.200 --> 08:37.580
But you know what really gets the crowd going wild during a match?

08:40.540 --> 08:42.420
Not an amazing spike, no.

08:42.420 --> 08:44.710
It's when they see an amazing receive.

08:45.630 --> 08:47.670
In volleyball, a sport where height means everything,

08:47.670 --> 08:52.680
libero may be one of the only positions where short players can thrive,

08:52.680 --> 08:56.520
but I didn't become a libero because of my height.

08:56.930 --> 08:59.270
Even if I were two meters tall,

08:59.270 --> 09:00.900
I'd still be a libero.

09:02.230 --> 09:05.650
Because it doesn't matter if you can't spike or block.

09:05.650 --> 09:09.450
So long as you prevent the ball from touching the floor, you can't lose in volleyball.

09:11.490 --> 09:13.530
And the one best equipped for that role...

09:14.830 --> 09:16.080
is the libero.

09:16.370 --> 09:18.790
S-So cool!

09:18.790 --> 09:22.210
Don't just blurt that out, dumbass!

09:22.500 --> 09:25.460
Want two bars of ice cream? Soda- and pear-flavored!

09:25.460 --> 09:25.960
Yessir!

09:26.380 --> 09:27.840
So tell me, wannabe ace.

09:27.840 --> 09:29.170
What's your specialty?

09:30.380 --> 09:33.890
You suck at receiving, but there's
 gotta be something you're good at.

09:33.890 --> 09:35.930
U-Uh...

09:35.930 --> 09:37.770
Playing the decoy...

09:37.770 --> 09:39.350
Say what? Playing coy?

09:39.890 --> 09:41.770
P-Playing the decoy.

09:42.350 --> 09:45.110
Why do you sound so down on yourself?

09:45.110 --> 09:50.110
Because it sounds so lame in comparison to "ace" and "guardian angel."

09:50.110 --> 09:52.450
Who cares how it sounds?

09:52.450 --> 09:53.410
But...

09:53.410 --> 09:57.490
If you can help a teammate score by playing the decoy,

09:58.870 --> 10:02.460
then your role is just as important.

10:03.460 --> 10:04.380
Right.

10:05.380 --> 10:08.670
Karasuno has the greatest decoy now.

10:08.670 --> 10:10.590
With the Hinata-Kageyama duo in our ranks,

10:10.590 --> 10:13.680
I'm sure we'll be able to land spikes
 we wouldn't have scored from before.

10:13.680 --> 10:14.680
Yeah.

10:15.260 --> 10:19.850
I get the feeling we can change thanks to the chemistry Mr. Takeda was talking about.

10:20.560 --> 10:23.060
I just hope we change for the better.

10:23.060 --> 10:24.690
Don't be so pessimistic.

10:25.560 --> 10:27.520
<b> Foot of the Slope</b>

10:27.940 --> 10:30.730
I know I might be annoying you, but please.

10:31.110 --> 10:34.700
As much as it hurts to admit, 
I'm too inexperienced to lead the team.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.660
These boys have amazing potential.

10:37.950 --> 10:40.620
Please coach them...

10:41.750 --> 10:42.660
Ukai!

10:44.870 --> 10:46.880
Damn, you're persistent.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.880
That's all I'm good for.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.840
No matter how many times you ask me, I'm not gonna take up coaching.

10:53.420 --> 10:58.850
My gramps may've been a coach, 
but I told you that I'm not cut out for it.

11:00.390 --> 11:05.100
Look, teach. While I'm sure you want a technical coach,

11:05.100 --> 11:07.810
I know that the Ukai name is what you're <i>really</i> after.

11:08.900 --> 11:10.820
Honestly, that's part of it.

11:11.780 --> 11:16.320
Once Coach Ukai left, we started 
losing our contacts with other teams.

11:16.320 --> 11:21.490
As a makeshift advisor who only started this year, I can't even arrange any practice matches.

11:21.490 --> 11:25.500
And you think my name could turn things around, huh?

11:25.790 --> 11:27.670
I beg of you, Ukai!

11:27.670 --> 11:28.630
I refuse.

11:29.840 --> 11:32.500
I get that you're serious about this,

11:32.500 --> 11:36.880
but I don't wanna babysit a bunch of annoying high schoolers.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.300
I'll come again.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.770
I just said I didn't wanna do it!

11:44.850 --> 11:46.600
I apologize for being so persistent,

11:46.600 --> 11:52.610
but I'm sure you'll understand why once you see those boys play.

11:55.490 --> 11:58.570
It doesn't matter how many times you ask.
 I'm still not gonna do it!

11:59.950 --> 12:02.530
Damn it all!

12:02.530 --> 12:03.330
Ow!

12:10.830 --> 12:11.500
All right.

12:33.480 --> 12:34.820
Hey, Suga.

12:34.820 --> 12:36.900
It's been a while.

12:36.900 --> 12:37.900
Please...

12:38.320 --> 12:40.490
Come back, Asahi.

12:43.620 --> 12:46.200
Nishinoya's coming back too. His suspension's been lifted.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.580
Oh, that's good.

12:48.580 --> 12:51.580
It must be reassuring to know he has your back.

12:51.960 --> 12:53.420
The same goes for you!

12:53.840 --> 12:57.380
We all feel more at ease when you're there, calling for sets!

12:58.090 --> 13:00.180
I appreciate the thought,

13:00.180 --> 13:03.220
but I'd just be holding you all down again if I came back.

13:03.220 --> 13:04.640
Listen to this.

13:04.640 --> 13:07.730
As much as I hate to admit it,
 we have an amazing first-year setter now.

13:07.730 --> 13:10.140
We've also got the greatest decoy!

13:10.810 --> 13:13.610
You won't have to shoulder the burden alone anymore!

13:13.900 --> 13:17.900
With these new members, all that's left is for you and Nishinoya to come back,

13:17.900 --> 13:20.530
and Karasuno won't be the fallen powerhouse anymore!

13:20.530 --> 13:22.570
Our team is about to undergo a radical transformation.

13:22.570 --> 13:24.370
<i>Now</i> is the time we need our ace—

13:23.450 --> 13:24.370
Azumane.

13:25.280 --> 13:26.990
It's your turn for career counseling.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.540
Sorry, Suga.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.500
You should go, dude.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.500
<i>You're</i> the one who wanted to see the ace.

13:37.500 --> 13:40.380
B-But a third-year classroom's too scary a place for me.

13:40.380 --> 13:41.720
Wait up, Asahi!

13:41.720 --> 13:42.470
Asahi?

13:42.470 --> 13:43.840
What?

13:44.760 --> 13:47.010
Huh? What are you two doing here?

13:47.010 --> 13:48.850
Well, uh...

13:48.850 --> 13:51.060
Faculty Office

13:49.350 --> 13:50.390
Right.

13:50.390 --> 13:51.060
Yes!

13:51.480 --> 13:52.770
Thank you so much!

13:52.770 --> 13:54.690
Likewise.

13:54.690 --> 13:56.520
Goodbye.

13:59.570 --> 14:00.780
All right!

14:00.780 --> 14:02.650
This is a huge opportunity!

14:02.650 --> 14:03.660
I'm sure...

14:03.660 --> 14:06.370

m 573 193.5 l 571.5 475.5 1420.5 664.5 1422 384

14:07.450 --> 14:08.580
Let me introduce you.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.410
This is Hinata and Kageyama. They're new members.

14:11.410 --> 14:13.460
Oh? First-years, huh?

14:13.460 --> 14:14.330
Hello!

14:14.330 --> 14:15.380
Hey.

14:15.380 --> 14:18.000
<i>He's shorter than Tsukishima,</i>

14:15.960 --> 14:17.170
How many joined this year?

14:17.170 --> 14:18.000
Four.

14:18.380 --> 14:21.920
They may be a bit unique,
 but they're all promising prospects.

14:18.380 --> 14:20.960
<i>but he's got this huge presence.</i>

14:20.960 --> 14:22.760
<i>So this is Karasuno's ace.</i>

14:22.760 --> 14:23.970
That so?

14:25.010 --> 14:26.640
<i>He's not as scary as he looks.</i>

14:26.640 --> 14:27.600
Do your best.

14:28.760 --> 14:30.470
Aren't you gonna do your best with us?

14:31.310 --> 14:33.140
I wanna be the ace someday,

14:33.140 --> 14:35.520
so I'd love to see for myself how a real ace plays!

14:36.860 --> 14:37.980
Azumane!

14:37.980 --> 14:40.030
The counselor's waiting, dude.

14:40.030 --> 14:42.690
Sorry, but I'm no ace.

14:46.990 --> 14:49.830
Um, did he get injured or something?

14:49.830 --> 14:50.910
Nah.

14:50.910 --> 14:52.370
It's not like that.

14:53.330 --> 14:54.250
The problem here...

14:55.330 --> 14:58.710
is that he might've fallen out of love with volleyball.

14:58.710 --> 15:02.760
But why? He's so tall! And people call him the ace!

15:03.760 --> 15:08.720
Asahi was the tallest guy on our team, and he had the power to go with it.

15:09.930 --> 15:13.180
He'd come up big in clutch situations,
 no matter how difficult a set was to put away.

15:13.810 --> 15:18.440
That's why all of us recognized him as our ace and placed all our trust in him.

15:19.520 --> 15:20.320
However...

15:21.480 --> 15:22.940
Did he get taken out?

15:24.610 --> 15:29.320
There was a match in which the opposition blocked all of his spikes.

15:30.200 --> 15:34.660
It hit him hard because he tends to take all the blame upon himself.

15:38.710 --> 15:40.040
What?

15:40.040 --> 15:42.800
Is that enough to make someone hate volleyball?

15:43.260 --> 15:45.760
I'm sure there were other reasons.

15:46.180 --> 15:47.510
Like what?

15:47.510 --> 15:48.640
Don't ask me.

15:48.640 --> 15:52.430
But we don't know for sure that he's come to hate the sport.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.390
Yeah!

15:56.810 --> 15:58.850
Rolling...

15:58.850 --> 16:01.360
Thunder!

16:04.690 --> 16:06.320
Uh, nice receive.

16:06.320 --> 16:08.780
That was just a rolling receive, dude!

16:08.780 --> 16:10.530
Why'd he yell that out?

16:10.530 --> 16:11.580
The hell was that?

16:11.580 --> 16:13.540
Kageyama! Tsukishima! Yamaguchi!

16:13.540 --> 16:15.290
You're all getting a talking to!

16:15.290 --> 16:17.500
Bend over—I mean, sit down!

16:17.500 --> 16:19.830
Let me look down on you!

16:18.170 --> 16:21.420
Teach me! Teach me how to do the Rolling Thunder!

16:21.420 --> 16:22.960
Hard at work, I see.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.630
Listen up, guys!

16:25.920 --> 16:28.180
We're holding it again this year, right?

16:28.840 --> 16:30.390
The Golden Week training camp, I mean.

16:30.720 --> 16:31.600
<i>Training camp?</i>

16:32.140 --> 16:35.060
Right. We still need a lot more practice.

16:35.350 --> 16:39.020
Now, for the last day of Golden Week...

16:39.390 --> 16:42.310
I've arranged a practice match!

16:42.310 --> 16:43.320
Wow!

16:43.320 --> 16:44.900
That's awesome, Take!

16:44.900 --> 16:45.980
Who are we playing?

16:46.690 --> 16:49.530
A Tokyo school with lots of history: Nekoma High.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.280
Also known as...

16:52.700 --> 16:53.530
"Cat."

16:54.450 --> 16:55.740
Cat?

16:55.740 --> 16:58.410
We've heard a lot about them too.

16:58.410 --> 17:02.040
Apparently we played each other a lot because our coaches were rivals.

17:02.040 --> 17:03.210
Oh?

17:03.210 --> 17:04.380
That's right.

17:04.380 --> 17:08.920
These famous derbies used to be called the 
"Battle of the Garbage Dumpster: Cat vs Crow."

17:08.920 --> 17:11.640
Are you <i>sure</i> these matches were famous derbies?

17:12.010 --> 17:14.890
We haven't had a connection 
with them for a while, though.

17:14.890 --> 17:15.890
Why now?

17:15.890 --> 17:18.810
Well, I'll let you in on the details later.

17:19.230 --> 17:25.020
But for now, I'll just say that once I heard about it, 
I wanted to restart the heated rivalry no matter what.

17:26.940 --> 17:29.070
Once he hears we're up against Nekoma High,

17:29.070 --> 17:31.740
<b> Foot of the Slope</b>

17:29.570 --> 17:31.280
he's sure to make a move.

17:35.410 --> 17:36.030
All right.

17:36.330 --> 17:39.790
A practice match doesn't come along all that often. Let's not let it go to waste!

17:39.790 --> 17:41.330
Yeah!

17:41.670 --> 17:43.080
Tokyo, eh?

17:43.080 --> 17:47.130
I'm gonna destroy those damn city boys!

17:47.130 --> 17:48.630
"City boys"?

17:48.630 --> 17:51.220
Not another word out of you, Tsukishima!

17:51.220 --> 17:52.380
Daichi.

17:53.260 --> 17:56.390
Sorry, but I'm not gonna play in the practice match.

17:57.260 --> 17:58.350
Nishinoya.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.100
Hey, what do you think this Tokyo school's like?

17:59.180 --> 18:01.100
Shouyou's a good kid,

18:01.100 --> 18:02.640
Think they're strong?

18:01.100 --> 18:05.020
and while all of the first-years seem like oddballs, they're all interesting in their own right.

18:05.650 --> 18:09.780
I think this team's, uh, headed in the right direction now.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.490
I want to train here as well.

18:13.450 --> 18:18.160
But if I were to play too, and we won with this lineup,

18:18.160 --> 18:21.500
I feel like it'd end up proving that we can do without Asahi.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.370
And I don't want that.

18:23.920 --> 18:26.080
Not after everything we've been through together.

18:26.590 --> 18:28.880
I-I'm sorry for acting so selfish.

18:29.550 --> 18:32.300
Gotcha, but attend the training camp.

18:32.300 --> 18:33.430
Huh? But...

18:33.430 --> 18:35.220
Noya! Do it again!

18:35.220 --> 18:36.970
Do the Rolling Thunder one more time!

18:36.970 --> 18:37.640
Okay?

18:43.190 --> 18:44.140
Dismissed!

18:44.140 --> 18:45.520
Thank you!

18:47.900 --> 18:53.240
Think things would be easier for Sugawara and Nishinoya if Asahi came back?

18:53.240 --> 18:54.240
Hell if I know.

18:54.530 --> 18:58.950
Sugawara said Asahi tends to take all the blame,

18:59.240 --> 19:01.330
but don't you think he himself is like that?

19:02.410 --> 19:04.920
I guess they both feel equally guilty.

19:06.290 --> 19:08.380
Even though there's no way you can win by yourself.

19:08.710 --> 19:10.960
Y-You're one to talk!

19:10.960 --> 19:13.880
I clearly remember what you said, you know.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.590
"If I'm stuck working with him,

19:16.590 --> 19:19.300
I'd rather do every receive, spike, and set by myself."

19:19.930 --> 19:21.220
Shut up!

19:21.220 --> 19:23.230
"I'd rather do everything by myself..."

19:28.440 --> 19:31.860
Everyone on our side of the court
 should be our ally, without exception.

19:33.280 --> 19:36.530
So I can't stand it when things on our side are all awkward.

19:46.040 --> 19:48.330
I appreciate the thought...

19:48.830 --> 19:52.300
But why are you so hung up over me? We've never even practiced together.

19:52.300 --> 19:56.010
B-Because if you don't come back, our seniors will never cheer u—

19:57.970 --> 19:59.300
Keep it down, dumbass.

19:59.930 --> 20:01.430
You two are a riot.

20:02.010 --> 20:03.180
But I'm sorry.

20:04.470 --> 20:10.270
I used to visualize breaking through high blocks in front of me,

20:11.270 --> 20:13.320
but I've completely lost that ability now.

20:14.150 --> 20:16.450
I keep seeing images of getting shut out,

20:16.450 --> 20:20.450
or getting so scared of it that I self-destruct.

20:20.990 --> 20:26.330
I'm just a first-year midget, so you 
might think I'm cocky for saying this.

20:26.330 --> 20:28.170
I won't. Go ahead.

20:29.040 --> 20:30.380
I get what you're saying.

20:30.920 --> 20:35.710
I have neither the height nor the technique, so I keep getting my shots blocked.

20:35.710 --> 20:36.840
But now,

20:37.170 --> 20:40.590
with this guy setting for me, I can evade
 any block, no matter how high it may be.

20:41.720 --> 20:43.600
The blockers vanish from my sight,

20:43.600 --> 20:46.730
and I get a clear view of the other side of the net.

20:47.390 --> 20:51.730
<i>Yeah, I kinda know what that view is like.</i>

20:52.020 --> 20:55.280
The ball hits my hand when I'm at the highest point on the court,

20:55.280 --> 20:58.700
and I can feel all of its weight in my palm.

20:59.070 --> 21:00.160
I love it!

21:01.700 --> 21:03.780
<i>I also know that feeling well.</i>

21:04.370 --> 21:07.080
I envy you, Asahi.

21:07.080 --> 21:11.630
Right now, I have neither the height nor the power to break through blocks on my own.

21:11.630 --> 21:13.170
But you do.

21:13.960 --> 21:16.510
So what if you've had plenty of spikes blocked?

21:16.510 --> 21:20.220
Haven't you scored with loads more?

21:20.590 --> 21:23.430
<i>That</i> is why everyone calls you the ace.

21:29.230 --> 21:30.770
Time's up. Let's head back.

21:32.230 --> 21:33.860
Move it, moron. We'll be late.

21:38.070 --> 21:38.820
Um...

21:40.150 --> 21:42.740
It's only natural that you can't win all by yourself.

21:42.740 --> 21:44.570
That's why you take the court in teams of six.

21:45.450 --> 21:49.540
Though I didn't realize that until very recently either, 
so I'm not exactly one to talk.

21:50.460 --> 21:51.580
If you'll excuse me.

21:59.970 --> 22:00.920
Let's go home, man.

22:01.760 --> 22:02.880
Wanna grab a bite on the way?

22:09.680 --> 22:10.810
One more!

22:10.810 --> 22:11.940
Gimme one more!

22:11.940 --> 22:13.900
Shut up! You don't need to tell me!

22:13.900 --> 22:14.560
Here it comes!

22:14.560 --> 22:15.270
Yeah!

22:22.860 --> 22:25.820
<i>The ball hits my hand when I'm at the highest point on the court,</i>

22:26.530 --> 22:29.620
<i>and I can feel all of its weight in my palm.</i>

22:30.500 --> 22:31.660
<i>I love it!</i>

22:34.170 --> 22:35.380
<i>I know.</i>

22:38.090 --> 22:39.630
<i>I know it all too well.</i>

22:41.920 --> 22:41.920
{ED}

22:52.560 --> 22:56.480
If I tell you this story,

22:56.480 --> 23:00.230
I wonder if I can explain to you

23:00.730 --> 23:04.700
my feelings

23:04.700 --> 23:07.700
and the distance between us

23:08.410 --> 23:16.370
Standing on an empty field

23:16.710 --> 23:25.300
I breathe out into the night air

23:25.300 --> 23:29.850
Countless times I swore that I would change

23:29.850 --> 23:33.850
I stumbled and fell a lot,

23:33.850 --> 23:37.810
but I swore I would laugh at the end

23:37.810 --> 23:41.730
and not let my tears go to waste

23:41.730 --> 23:45.740
There are so many dreams that can definitely come true

23:45.740 --> 23:49.740
I always sat somewhere, downcast, dejected, depressed,

23:49.740 --> 23:52.290
but still I decided I would fight,

23:52.290 --> 23:57.290
and not let all my frustration go to waste

23:57.290 --> 24:01.630
This is our revenge

24:12.890 --> 24:15.270
<i>I wish Azumane would hurry up and come back.</i>

24:15.270 --> 24:16.480
<i>He had stubble.</i>

24:16.480 --> 24:17.020
<i>What?</i>

24:17.020 --> 24:19.980
<i>Maybe I could be more like an ace by growing some stubble!</i>
