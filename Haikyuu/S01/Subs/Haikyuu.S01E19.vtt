00:22.710 --> 00:23.670
He did it again!

00:23.670 --> 00:26.340
That's the fourth consecutive service ace.

00:25.210 --> 00:27.170
Aoba Jousai                Oomisaki

00:25.210 --> 00:27.170
Aoba Jousai                Oomisaki

00:27.550 --> 00:31.970
Obviously he's got power, but that control of his is brutal.

00:31.970 --> 00:34.720
But if we can just work around that serve...

00:35.560 --> 00:37.640
Yes, his serve is terrifying,

00:37.640 --> 00:41.730
but as a setter, Oikawa is a complete unknown to us.

00:41.730 --> 00:43.360
Serve up another one!

00:47.280 --> 00:50.860
OlÃ©!

00:51.820 --> 00:52.780
I'm sorry!

00:52.780 --> 00:53.530
We have a chance!

00:53.870 --> 00:54.700
I got it!

00:55.740 --> 00:56.950
Okay!

00:57.750 --> 00:59.210
The thing about setters is...

01:01.540 --> 01:04.670
they're a lot like conductors in an orchestra.

01:05.170 --> 01:07.880
You can have the same song and the same orchestra...

01:08.970 --> 01:10.550
but change the conductor

01:11.510 --> 01:13.090
and you get a whole different sound.

01:34.620 --> 01:41.000
I take two deep breaths and calm my heart

01:41.250 --> 01:47.670
I take a step with my left foot to break the silence

01:48.380 --> 01:54.840
Get your nervousness in check and reign in your mind

01:55.180 --> 01:58.390
You have it in you

01:58.390 --> 02:01.230
You can cast out the demons

02:02.100 --> 02:08.360
Fate? Random chance? Questions? Answers? It's all one

02:08.360 --> 02:10.650
This is the sign

02:14.990 --> 02:16.820
Oh, yeah!

02:16.820 --> 02:19.450
The world is opening to us

02:19.450 --> 02:22.500
We pass the door,

02:22.500 --> 02:28.670
look straight ahead, and never look back

02:28.670 --> 02:30.590
Oh, yeah!

02:30.590 --> 02:36.300
I put my hand to my chest

02:36.300 --> 02:42.430
I can feel the proof that I exist

02:42.430 --> 02:46.560

02:54.900 --> 02:58.700
They seem to have really smooth teamwork.

02:59.330 --> 03:01.120
Oikawa and Iwaizumi.

03:01.790 --> 03:03.410
He's number four, their left wing spiker.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.880
I heard they've been playing together since grade school.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.380
They have what you call a non-verbal understanding.

03:10.960 --> 03:17.390
I don't think it's because the second-year setter they used in the practice match was inferior in any way.

03:17.390 --> 03:19.220
He does go to Seijou after all.

03:19.220 --> 03:19.850
Yes.

03:20.140 --> 03:29.560
It's more like this Oikawa character knows his team so well that he can bring them up to 100% functional capacity.

03:24.180 --> 03:25.940
Oikawa, one more point!

03:25.940 --> 03:27.400
Give us a good serve!

03:32.280 --> 03:34.150
The Great King is so cool!

03:35.240 --> 03:36.650
I wanna play against him so bad!

03:36.650 --> 03:39.450
Yeah! I hope he'll aim that serve at me!

03:39.450 --> 03:40.320
I wanna receive it!

03:40.320 --> 03:42.240
Noya, you're super cool too!

03:42.240 --> 03:43.540
That sounds hopeful.

03:43.950 --> 03:46.750
Hey, look at that, Shouyou! It's a TV camera!

03:46.750 --> 03:48.080
What? A TV camera?!

03:48.080 --> 03:50.460
Holy cow! I wanna be on TV too!

03:50.460 --> 03:53.300
Hey, you two. The junior high...

03:53.880 --> 03:55.840

03:55.840 --> 03:57.300
Keep it down.

04:32.340 --> 04:33.590
They're all passed out.

04:34.630 --> 04:36.380
They did play two matches.

04:36.380 --> 04:39.510
We won both matches in straight sets, 
so it could be worse.

04:40.090 --> 04:45.140
If we win tomorrow, not only will there be two matches a day, but our opponents will be progressively stronger.

04:45.140 --> 04:47.600
We need to get them freshly motivated for each match.

04:47.600 --> 04:48.350
Yes.

04:54.690 --> 04:57.190
Okay, it's meeting time!

04:57.190 --> 04:59.650

06:58.610 --> 07:01.320

07:01.320 --> 07:02.740
Oh, uh...

07:01.320 --> 07:05.320
The seasonal rain front is still keeping to the south, 
so tomorrow will be another fine day.

07:02.740 --> 07:04.740
Okay, then.

07:06.610 --> 07:07.700
Let's get started.

07:08.570 --> 07:09.410
Get what started?!

07:09.410 --> 07:11.790
O-Our meeting!

07:13.620 --> 07:15.500
Today's match against Date Tech...

07:16.080 --> 07:18.460
was the proverbial first sip of beer!

07:20.960 --> 07:25.550
That first sip of a beer has a unique flavor.

07:25.550 --> 07:29.510
Ukai, please talk about things that minors can understand.

07:31.060 --> 07:31.760
Ahem.

07:33.600 --> 07:37.900
So, by using the Date Tech match to debut the deviant fast attack,

07:37.900 --> 07:40.480
we were able to take our opponent by surprise.

07:41.150 --> 07:46.610
But since we've played Seijou once before,
 they already know our bag of tricks for the most part.

07:47.860 --> 07:52.910
Keep in mind, however, that you definitely have good offensive power.

07:53.910 --> 07:57.080
We need to start by enduring that serve Oikawa does.

07:58.250 --> 08:01.130
Having that serve control the match's momentum

08:01.590 --> 08:05.090
is the worst, and most likely, pattern.

08:05.840 --> 08:12.810
So, as you know, our current formation is based on everyone except the setter going after serves.

08:28.320 --> 08:33.030
When you watched Seijou play, you were thinking, "Crap. They're too tough." Weren't you?

08:34.700 --> 08:41.210
But let's just say, for example, we were watching our own match against Date Tech as spectators.

08:42.380 --> 08:46.960
We'd think, "What kind of block is that?! It scares me! There's no chance in hell!" We'd freak out, right?

08:49.050 --> 08:51.840
But we fought them and won.

08:52.470 --> 08:53.800
And we'll do the same tomorrow.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.520
Yeah!

09:03.150 --> 09:06.980
Okay, let's quickly run through the formation!

09:06.980 --> 09:08.110
Yessir!

09:09.820 --> 09:10.820
Ukai.

09:11.860 --> 09:13.490
Hey, Mori!

09:13.490 --> 09:15.870
Here's today's match.

09:14.370 --> 09:14.410
{=10}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.370 --> 09:14.410
{=9}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.410 --> 09:14.450
{=10}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.410 --> 09:14.450
{=9}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.450 --> 09:14.490
{=10}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.450 --> 09:14.490
{=9}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.490 --> 09:14.530
{=10}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.490 --> 09:14.530
{=9}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.530 --> 09:14.580
{=10}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.530 --> 09:14.580
{=9}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.580 --> 09:14.620
{=10}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.580 --> 09:14.620
{=9}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.620 --> 09:14.660
{=10}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.620 --> 09:14.660
{=9}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.660 --> 09:14.700
{=10}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.660 --> 09:14.700
{=9}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.700 --> 09:14.740
{=10}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.700 --> 09:14.740
{=9}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.740 --> 09:14.780
{=10}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.740 --> 09:14.780
{=9}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.780 --> 09:14.830
{=10}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.780 --> 09:14.830
{=9}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.830 --> 09:14.870
{=10}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.830 --> 09:14.870
{=9}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.870 --> 09:17.910
{=10}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:14.870 --> 09:17.910
{=9}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:15.870 --> 09:17.330
Thanks, buddy!

09:17.910 --> 09:20.040
You're a lifesaver.

09:20.040 --> 09:20.920
Next time, drinks are on me.

09:20.920 --> 09:23.500
Right on! Yay!

09:23.500 --> 09:24.710
Later!

09:24.710 --> 09:26.670
Is that the Aoba Jousai match?

09:26.670 --> 09:34.680
Yup. Although I doubt watching this today will 
magically make us ready to take on Oikawa's serves.

09:28.260 --> 09:35.220
{=10}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:28.260 --> 09:35.220
{=9}Seijou vs Oomisaki

09:35.680 --> 09:38.810
But doing nothing makes me restless.

09:39.310 --> 09:41.600
Ukai, next time your drinks are on me!

09:41.600 --> 09:42.560
You mean it?!

09:42.940 --> 09:45.190
Okay, show up on time again tomorrow!

09:45.190 --> 09:46.610
Yessir!

09:53.530 --> 10:01.960
I want to take this oh-so-precious junior of mine on, setter-on-setter, in an official match and destroy him!

10:09.760 --> 10:13.630
Kageyama seems more on edge than usual.

10:14.760 --> 10:15.720
There he goes.

10:16.220 --> 10:17.600
Hey, Kageyama.

10:17.600 --> 10:20.850
You'll end up with permanent frown lines in your late teens.

10:20.850 --> 10:21.480
Huh?!

10:22.180 --> 10:24.400
We're gonna overthrow the Great King tomorrow.

10:26.230 --> 10:29.360
<i>Overthrow Oikawa?</i>

10:29.780 --> 10:33.530
We're gonna be on TV, so you need to practice looking pleasant!

10:33.530 --> 10:34.820
Mind your own business!

10:35.200 --> 10:36.950
We're winning this match.

10:36.950 --> 10:38.780
We have to win to advance.

10:41.540 --> 10:42.960
All right!

10:48.210 --> 10:49.960
See you later, sir!

10:49.960 --> 10:52.420
Right. Bye-bye!

11:00.140 --> 11:03.560
<b>Karasuno vs Date Tech</b>

11:00.140 --> 11:03.560

11:04.060 --> 11:07.440
Hey. Make sure not to stay up too late.

11:08.770 --> 11:11.570
Who are you, my mom?

11:11.980 --> 11:12.990
Huh?

11:13.900 --> 11:16.280
Sorry, sorry! I won't! I promise!

11:16.280 --> 11:18.570
I'll be there in full fighting form!

11:18.570 --> 11:21.540
Stop wasting my time, Oikawa, you little shit!

11:21.540 --> 11:23.910
I have to lock up the clubroom, so move your ass, Slothkawa!

11:23.910 --> 11:25.120
Don't abbreviate your insults!

11:25.120 --> 11:26.080
Oikawa, you sloth!

11:26.080 --> 11:28.130
You don't have to revise it!

11:51.230 --> 11:53.690
Is this player what I think he is?

12:54.420 --> 12:59.590
Go for it! Go, go, go, go, Seijou!

12:58.880 --> 13:00.340
Let's have a good match.

12:59.590 --> 13:04.890
Attack! Attack, attack, attack, attack, Seijou!

13:00.760 --> 13:02.300
Let's.

13:02.300 --> 13:05.760
Fly

13:02.300 --> 13:05.760
Fly

13:02.800 --> 13:05.760
Karasuno made it to day two.

13:05.760 --> 13:08.100
I burned another paid day off.

13:08.100 --> 13:10.100
I won't be getting vacation for a while.

13:10.100 --> 13:10.730
Me neither.

13:11.560 --> 13:16.280
Date Tech also had a good amount of support, but this is different.

13:16.280 --> 13:17.690
One, two...

13:17.990 --> 13:22.360
Oikawa, you can do it!

13:22.360 --> 13:23.660
They've got this.

13:24.280 --> 13:26.620
I'll be damned if I lose to them! Let's do this!

13:26.620 --> 13:28.620
Yeah!

13:28.950 --> 13:30.500
Make yourselves heard!

13:30.500 --> 13:32.670
Seijou owns this court!

13:30.870 --> 13:33.000
We got the first serve.

13:32.670 --> 13:34.330
Yessir!

13:33.000 --> 13:33.580
Right!

13:37.630 --> 13:39.090
One, two...

13:39.090 --> 13:41.720
Oikawa, you can do iâ

13:41.720 --> 13:43.430
Karasuno...

13:43.430 --> 13:44.010
Fight!

13:44.340 --> 13:45.180
Yeah!

13:45.180 --> 13:45.760
Fight!

13:46.180 --> 13:46.970
Yeah!

13:46.970 --> 13:47.560
Fight!

13:47.560 --> 13:48.520
Take that!

13:48.520 --> 13:49.430
Fight!

13:51.730 --> 13:53.980
Next, serves!

13:52.140 --> 13:53.980
They've got enough enthusiasm.

13:53.980 --> 13:55.690
Yessir!

13:53.980 --> 13:58.150
Hey, that reminds me. 
Has your apprentice improved at serves?

13:57.900 --> 13:59.030
I'm going in!

13:58.150 --> 13:59.940
What do you mean by apprentice?

14:00.440 --> 14:04.160
Would you please teach me 
how to do the jump float serve?

14:04.490 --> 14:06.700
It's only been a week.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.910
I'm sure he can hit one on accident,

14:10.580 --> 14:13.580
but he's got a long way to go before he can summon a ball with no rotation.

14:18.420 --> 14:21.920
Not bad, Makki! You're looking sharp.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.600
Sorry, Kindaichi.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.470
That last one was a little high.

14:28.470 --> 14:30.220
No, it was... Yes, sir!

14:32.850 --> 14:35.600
Iwa, are you a little tense?

14:35.600 --> 14:38.270
You don't have to try to look good.

14:38.270 --> 14:41.610
None of the girls are looking at you anyway.

14:42.820 --> 14:46.370
Oikawa notices every little thing about his players.

14:43.070 --> 14:46.370
Iwaizumi, calm down! We're about to play!

14:46.370 --> 14:47.870
Leggo, Kindaichi!

14:47.870 --> 14:50.370
Save it for another time!

14:47.870 --> 14:54.830
I can't say anything about the technical aspect, 
but I can tell that his team has pretty good chemistry.

14:50.370 --> 14:51.870
C'mon, everyone's staring!

14:51.870 --> 14:53.750
I don't care! I'm gonna whack him one!

14:53.750 --> 14:56.000
Hey! Don't say that!

14:57.330 --> 14:59.710
Iwaizumi, calm down!

14:59.710 --> 15:00.960
Are you sure?

15:00.960 --> 15:03.380
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

15:00.960 --> 15:03.380

 official match for the first time.</i>

16:07.200 --> 16:09.320
Let's have a good match!

16:09.320 --> 16:11.660
Oh, it's starting!

16:11.660 --> 16:13.040
Time for round three!

16:13.040 --> 16:14.540
The winner's in the quarterfinals!

16:15.120 --> 16:16.660
Which team will win?

16:16.660 --> 16:19.000
Surely it'll be Aoba Jousai.

16:19.790 --> 16:21.420
Hey there, Tobio.

16:22.920 --> 16:26.420
I came here looking forward to 
defeating a "prodigious setter."

16:26.800 --> 16:29.890
So do your best to keep up with me.

16:32.600 --> 16:33.430
We'll definitelyâ

16:33.430 --> 16:34.470
We won't lose!

16:34.470 --> 16:37.810
Don't overlap me, you dumbass!

16:39.310 --> 16:40.270
We'll beat you again.

16:42.860 --> 16:44.110
Just like last time!

16:44.690 --> 16:50.160
Go for it! Go, go, go, go, Seijou!

16:47.570 --> 16:52.870
<b>Rule the Court</b>

16:47.570 --> 16:52.870
<b>Rule the Court</b>

16:50.160 --> 16:55.450
Attack! Attack, attack, attack, attack, Seijou!

16:51.870 --> 16:55.450
All of you have beaten Aoba Jousai once before.

16:55.450 --> 17:00.420
Go for it! Go, go, go, go, Seijou!

16:56.080 --> 16:59.670
Even if our opponents weren't at
 the top of their game the last time,

16:59.670 --> 17:03.420
I think that defeating them once before is a good reason to be confident.

17:00.420 --> 17:05.170
Attack! Attack, attack, attack, attack, Seijou!

17:04.000 --> 17:05.170
Don't be conceited.

17:05.880 --> 17:06.880
Be confident.

17:06.880 --> 17:08.010
Yes, sir!

17:08.340 --> 17:10.720
Karasuno, fight!

17:10.720 --> 17:12.220
Yessir!

17:12.220 --> 17:15.140
Okay, let's do this.

17:15.140 --> 17:16.810
Just like yesterday...

17:19.690 --> 17:22.270
I'm trusting you guys.

17:26.730 --> 17:28.690
It's like the mood just shifted

17:29.530 --> 17:32.660
in the Aoba Jousai team.

17:33.280 --> 17:35.700
<i>It's his usual phrase before a match.</i>

17:35.700 --> 17:41.460
<i>When he says it, it sounds like a joke, but it can also sound like a threat.</i>

17:42.250 --> 17:47.050
<i>They know his words are as simple and straightforward as they sound.</i>

17:47.630 --> 17:51.340
<i>That's why they put their full trust in him in return.</i>

17:52.680 --> 17:53.590
Let's go!

17:54.010 --> 17:55.350
Yessir!

18:34.550 --> 18:36.140
Tsukishima, give us a nice serve!

18:36.930 --> 18:37.640
Kunimi!

18:37.640 --> 18:38.180
Right!

18:38.180 --> 18:39.140
Nice receive!

18:39.560 --> 18:41.520
The two in front are going in to jump!

18:41.520 --> 18:42.480
Who'll get the ball?!

18:42.810 --> 18:43.940
I got it!

18:44.390 --> 18:48.150
<i>I haven't seen Oikawa set a ball up close in a long time.</i>

19:00.200 --> 19:02.500
A setter dump, right off the bat!

19:05.960 --> 19:09.040
Way to go, Tooru! Work it, work it, Tooru!

19:05.960 --> 19:11.920
<b>Rule the Court</b>

19:05.960 --> 19:11.920
<b>Rule the Court</b>

19:09.040 --> 19:11.380
One more point!

19:12.260 --> 19:13.300
Shit.

19:13.300 --> 19:16.890
That was a really bold setter dump.

19:17.260 --> 19:20.350
Come on now. Our next play will be the same.

19:20.350 --> 19:22.850
So wake up and pay attention, okay?

19:26.270 --> 19:29.230
I-Is he really gonna do another one?!

19:29.230 --> 19:31.690
Nobody does those back to back.

19:31.690 --> 19:34.440
That's how they fool you and do two of 'em in a row.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.900
I get it!

19:35.900 --> 19:37.410
You're smart, Tanaka!

19:37.410 --> 19:38.870
Come on, you two.

19:38.870 --> 19:41.410
There's no use trying to second-guess.

19:41.410 --> 19:45.580
It's like trying to guess the next move in rock-paper-scissors.

19:46.370 --> 19:49.330
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

19:46.370 --> 19:49.330
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

19:47.170 --> 19:48.580
Don't overthink it.

19:48.580 --> 19:49.330
Yes, sir!

19:50.090 --> 19:51.840
Give us a good one, Matsukawa!

19:52.300 --> 19:53.090
I got it!

19:53.510 --> 19:55.220
Daichi, nice receive!

19:55.220 --> 19:56.010
B!

19:56.010 --> 19:57.430
Send it my way!

19:57.430 --> 19:59.180
Hey, it's number ten!

19:59.180 --> 20:00.260
Is he gonna do it?!

20:02.930 --> 20:05.390
Yes! It's the super-fast attack!

20:05.770 --> 20:07.890
Damn! It went straight to him!

20:07.890 --> 20:12.440
Hey, is Seijou's setter gonna dump it again?!

20:12.440 --> 20:14.440
But it's way more obvious this time!

20:15.150 --> 20:16.360
Don't mess withâ

20:21.620 --> 20:24.620
He went from spike to... set!

20:27.250 --> 20:29.210
<b>Rule the Court</b>

20:27.250 --> 20:29.210
<b>Rule the Court</b>

20:29.620 --> 20:31.380
Hey, that was a little low.

20:31.380 --> 20:33.340
Was it? Sorry.

20:33.340 --> 20:36.550
Still, you always end up hitting 'em, Iwa.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.090
Wow.

20:38.090 --> 20:40.510
They piss me off, but they're good.

20:40.510 --> 20:42.970
He's so cool!

20:42.970 --> 20:45.720
Oikawa!

20:46.180 --> 20:49.770
Our opponents are gonna be tougher than I thought.

20:49.770 --> 20:54.190
Yes. I know we won our practice match with them not long ago.

20:54.900 --> 21:00.570
But now that this team is being led by their conductor of a starting setter, it's completely different.

21:01.660 --> 21:02.780
Shit.

21:02.780 --> 21:04.030
Come on, you guys.

21:04.950 --> 21:07.750
You already knew Oikawa was good.

21:08.250 --> 21:12.330
Besides, our setter's skill and our attacks have just as much pizazz as theirs!

21:13.340 --> 21:14.250
Thank you!

21:15.750 --> 21:17.920
Matsukawa, serve up another one!

21:19.130 --> 21:19.630
Nishinoya!

21:19.630 --> 21:20.470
Right!

21:21.680 --> 21:23.600
Send it my way!

21:28.930 --> 21:29.810
<i>It's number five!</i>

21:32.600 --> 21:34.270
Or so you were led to believe...

21:41.070 --> 21:41.910
<i>It's a pipe?!</i>

22:03.590 --> 22:04.180
He...

22:05.300 --> 22:07.350
He dumped them back!

22:08.100 --> 22:10.140
He must really hate to lose.

22:10.140 --> 22:11.480
Do more!

22:14.440 --> 22:15.360
By the way,

22:17.070 --> 22:21.070
our next play will be the same, so please pay attention.

22:21.780 --> 22:22.950
You...

22:24.240 --> 22:25.820
little shit.
