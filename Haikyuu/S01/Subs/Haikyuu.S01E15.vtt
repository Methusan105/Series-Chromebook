00:08.660 --> 00:11.160
Fly

00:09.410 --> 00:11.160
I didn't know we had this!

00:12.870 --> 00:13.700
You can do it.

00:22.130 --> 00:25.420
Wait, what is this?! This is getting out of hand!

00:25.960 --> 00:28.720
We're going to win in the first round!

00:28.720 --> 00:30.470
Yessir!

00:54.490 --> 00:55.870
Morning.

01:07.630 --> 01:10.090
Listen, it's finally time for...

01:10.090 --> 01:11.050
Don't speak!

01:11.050 --> 01:11.590
Pardon?

01:12.260 --> 01:15.260
I'll bet you're about to say something sentimental.

01:15.260 --> 01:18.640
Like, "it's finally time for our final interhigh..."

01:18.640 --> 01:19.930
or other such nonsense.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.480
It's finally time for our final interhigh.

01:25.480 --> 01:26.320
Yeah.

01:27.530 --> 01:30.900
We've been through a lot together.

01:32.160 --> 01:35.870
That kind of conversation is like 
marking us for death, so no way!

01:35.870 --> 01:38.410
Oh, come on! Why not?!

01:38.410 --> 01:41.040
What about yesterday? I wanted to boost our morale

01:41.040 --> 01:47.460
by getting all us third-years together for a quiet chat under the stars to mentally prepare for our final interhigh.

01:47.460 --> 01:49.300
But you guys just up and left.

01:49.710 --> 01:53.300
We got a 120% boost in morale thanks to Shimizu's surprise.

01:53.300 --> 01:55.140
Yeah, well...

01:55.140 --> 01:57.760
Yeah, true, but...

01:57.760 --> 02:05.730
{=1}Miyagi Prefectural Karasuno Senior High School

01:57.760 --> 02:05.730
{=0}Miyagi Prefectural Karasuno Senior High School

01:58.180 --> 02:02.890
Today we have to win in the first and second round to make it to day two.

02:02.890 --> 02:05.730
I don't want to talk like it's all over just yet.

02:06.110 --> 02:08.230
We'll win every match put in front of us!

02:08.570 --> 02:10.190
That's all you need to think about!

02:10.990 --> 02:11.990
Right.

02:12.320 --> 02:15.160
Because we're counting on you, ace.

02:15.160 --> 02:15.910
Sure.

02:16.620 --> 02:19.080
Daichi is kind of scary when he's being nice.

02:19.080 --> 02:20.870
Maybe it'll rain.

02:20.870 --> 02:23.580
Would you prefer me to rake you over the coals instead?

02:24.790 --> 02:26.420
Good morning!

02:28.630 --> 02:30.840
Right! We'll open up the clubroom now!

02:32.470 --> 02:33.340
Let's go.

02:33.340 --> 02:34.220
Right!

02:35.010 --> 02:35.010
{OP}

02:39.640 --> 02:44.980
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

02:39.640 --> 02:44.980
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

02:49.650 --> 02:56.030
I take two deep breaths and calm my heart

02:56.280 --> 03:02.700
I take a step with my left foot to break the silence

03:03.410 --> 03:09.880
Get your nervousness in check and reign in your mind

03:10.210 --> 03:13.420
You have it in you

03:13.420 --> 03:16.260
You can cast out the demons

03:17.140 --> 03:23.390
Fate? Random chance? Questions? Answers? It's all one

03:23.390 --> 03:25.690
This is the sign

03:30.020 --> 03:31.860
Oh, yeah!

03:31.860 --> 03:34.490
The world is opening to us

03:34.490 --> 03:37.530
We pass the door,

03:37.530 --> 03:43.700
look straight ahead, and never look back

03:43.700 --> 03:45.620
Oh, yeah!

03:45.620 --> 03:51.340
I put my hand to my chest

03:51.340 --> 03:57.470
I can feel the proof that I exist

03:57.470 --> 04:01.600
It is my beating heart

04:04.970 --> 04:04.970
{Part A}

04:05.480 --> 04:09.480
Episode Fifteen:
We're Back

04:05.480 --> 04:09.480
Episode Fifteen:
We're Back

04:10.480 --> 04:12.900
I wonder what the Karasuno team is like.

04:12.900 --> 04:15.070
I hope they aren't too tall.

04:15.070 --> 04:19.030
Don't worry. They say that they haven't been that hot recently.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.990
Shiratorizawa will take the whole thing as usual.

04:22.450 --> 04:26.120
No, Aoba Jousai seems to be a threat this year.

04:26.120 --> 04:29.290
They're a cut above the rest now that Oikawa is a third-year.

04:29.290 --> 04:32.710
And I hear the Seijou first-years are improving fast.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.670
But can they win in a block with Date Tech?

04:37.670 --> 04:40.220
I'm glad we aren't in Block A.

04:40.220 --> 04:42.930
Let's see, Block A has...

04:42.930 --> 04:47.890
Karasuno

04:42.930 --> 04:47.890
Karasuno

04:44.680 --> 04:46.930
Tori? Torino?

04:46.930 --> 04:47.890
Don't you mean Karasuno?

04:48.480 --> 04:50.270
Weren't they pretty good a few years back?

04:50.270 --> 04:52.690
Yeah, maybe a few years ago.

04:52.690 --> 04:56.400
Now they've earned themselves a totally lame nickname.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.650
Really? What is it?

04:57.650 --> 05:00.570
If I remember correctly, "the fallen champs."

05:00.990 --> 05:02.280
"The clipped crows."

05:07.160 --> 05:09.210
Hey, be careful!

05:09.210 --> 05:09.660
Huh?

05:09.660 --> 05:12.880
Can't fly? What's that again? Hmm?

05:13.170 --> 05:14.710
Come on, we're going!

05:14.710 --> 05:15.590
I'm so sorry.

05:15.590 --> 05:16.880
That's okay.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.300
Stop picking fights.

05:18.300 --> 05:19.130
Yes, sir.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.270
They look so dark.

05:28.270 --> 05:30.520
One of them doesn't look like he belongs in high school.

05:30.850 --> 05:32.900
I-Is that who I think it is?!

05:32.900 --> 05:34.690
It's Azumane of Karasuno!

05:35.980 --> 05:37.820
What? Who's he?

05:37.820 --> 05:38.940
You mean you don't know?!

05:39.360 --> 05:42.450
I heard he got his underlings to 
beat up the guys from North High.

05:42.450 --> 05:44.620
Come on, join in.

05:44.620 --> 05:47.660
It's a fight! I have to call the police!

05:48.290 --> 05:51.460
And he tried to sell a questionable substance on the street.

05:51.460 --> 05:52.540
50,000 works for me.

05:53.210 --> 05:54.880
You dropped your handkerchief.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.340
I'm sorry!

05:57.000 --> 05:58.880
And he got held back five years.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.550
What?! Then he's an adult!

06:01.220 --> 06:03.220
There, there. It's just the norm.

06:03.220 --> 06:05.260
That's the image you project.

06:05.260 --> 06:07.720
All I wanted...

06:07.720 --> 06:11.350
was to look a little wild on the outside, that's all!

06:11.350 --> 06:15.770
There, y'see? Nobody wild would go around saying that.

06:18.520 --> 06:21.070
What's wrong with that? Who cares what you look like?

06:21.780 --> 06:24.200
This is what we call "wild."

06:25.950 --> 06:27.240
Hey, look at that.

06:27.580 --> 06:29.700
It looks like the banner did its job!

06:29.700 --> 06:30.910
Do you think so?

06:30.910 --> 06:34.040
It was far more effective than my silly poem.

06:34.040 --> 06:35.250
She's cute!

06:35.250 --> 06:36.500
Go talk to her.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.210
Should I? Should I really?

06:43.260 --> 06:44.380
Knock that off.

06:44.380 --> 06:45.800
Kiyoko...

06:45.800 --> 06:47.350
...smacked me!

06:47.350 --> 06:49.100
Say, you see the little guy?

06:49.600 --> 06:51.680
That's gotta be Nishinoya from Chidoriyama.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.440
He won the award for best libero in junior high.

06:52.390 --> 06:54.440
Now I have the energy for another day!

06:54.440 --> 06:56.060
What, he did?

06:56.060 --> 06:57.400
That's not all.

06:58.060 --> 06:59.400
Look at him over there.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.110
He's that prodigy setter they're talking about.

07:01.900 --> 07:04.570
Kitagawa First's King of the Court!

07:04.570 --> 07:05.610
Huh?

07:08.370 --> 07:09.660
Why Karasuno?

07:09.660 --> 07:10.950
Beats me.

07:10.950 --> 07:14.750
But he had a really bad rep in junior high.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.710
Okay, then who's he?

07:17.170 --> 07:19.750
Is the little guy as impressive as the rest of them?

07:19.750 --> 07:21.380
Whoa!

07:22.710 --> 07:25.220
Actually, I...

07:25.970 --> 07:26.720
have no idea.

07:27.010 --> 07:29.890

That's okay.

What're you talking about?

I get you, bro!

<i>No eyebrows!</i>

Who do you think you are?

Hold it, hold it, hold it.

Stop that!

I'm so sorry!

08:33.080 --> 08:33.700
That's okay.

08:33.700 --> 08:35.790
Hey, Futakuchi. Give me a hand.

08:35.790 --> 08:36.870
Coming!

08:36.870 --> 08:41.670
I'm so sorry. The dude has a habit of singling out a team's ace.

08:42.330 --> 08:45.500
So I'd like you to get good and ready...

08:45.500 --> 08:47.340
to lose again.

08:47.670 --> 08:49.590
You guys are way too rude!

08:49.590 --> 08:51.430
Why do you always do that?!

08:52.720 --> 08:56.020
Well, that was a little scary.

08:56.020 --> 08:57.100
Yeah.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.890
I'm amazed you kept looking him in the eye.

09:01.100 --> 09:02.900
Th-That was nerve-wracking.

09:02.900 --> 09:06.190
Why are you such a wimp off the court?

09:06.190 --> 09:07.860
Noya, sugarcoat it!

09:08.240 --> 09:09.280
Sawamura.

09:10.280 --> 09:11.160
Long time no see.

09:11.160 --> 09:12.950
Hey, Ikejiri!

09:12.950 --> 09:14.870
Go on ahead without me, guys.

09:14.870 --> 09:16.080
Yessir.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.580
It's really been a long time.

09:19.580 --> 09:22.710
You look bigger somehow.

09:22.710 --> 09:25.380
Really? I'm the same height as I was before.

09:25.380 --> 09:27.210
That's not what I meant.

09:27.210 --> 09:28.170
I'm bigger sideways?!

09:28.170 --> 09:29.590
Not that.

09:31.630 --> 09:37.100
<i>His build has changed, his intensity has changed, and I'll bet his training schedule has changed too.</i>

09:38.020 --> 09:43.440
I saw you at the entrance a second ago, 
but you were so intimidating, I couldn't say anything.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.190
What the heck?

09:45.190 --> 09:49.030
Yeah, we do have a few outwardly intimidating guys in our crew.

09:49.030 --> 09:52.240
No, they look really tough.

09:52.240 --> 09:53.570
And so do you.

09:53.570 --> 09:54.490
You think?

09:54.490 --> 09:58.450
Anyway, we're what you call a small-time team.

10:02.040 --> 10:02.620
Ikejiri?

10:02.620 --> 10:03.960
I take that back!

10:04.630 --> 10:08.630
It doesn't matter if we're small time or big time, or former big time!

10:08.630 --> 10:12.340
If a net stands between us, we'll wipe the floor with you!

10:18.930 --> 10:20.640
I'm getting nervous.

10:20.640 --> 10:21.850
Yeah.

10:21.850 --> 10:25.690
Was it me, or were our opponent's spikes really amazing at practice?

10:25.690 --> 10:28.020
They made it to the round of 8 last year.

10:28.020 --> 10:30.070
I hope we don't get matched against them!

10:30.400 --> 10:33.570
Maybe we should've been more diligent about morning practice.

10:36.070 --> 10:40.540
<i>Even if you find yourself facing an unbeatably tough opponent,</i>

10:41.330 --> 10:43.540
<i>you can't win unless you try.</i>

10:44.330 --> 10:47.250
Looking back at it now, we had more than enough time.

10:48.670 --> 10:51.210
We could've practiced more than we did.

10:51.210 --> 10:53.550
Maybe we should've given it more priority.

10:53.550 --> 10:55.260
Yui, it's too late.

10:55.260 --> 10:56.930
But none of that matters anymore!

10:57.930 --> 11:01.060
The starting whistle blows in 45 minutes.

11:01.060 --> 11:07.230
All we can do now is do a proper warmup and 
play to the best of our ability until the very end!

11:07.520 --> 11:08.440
After that...

11:09.610 --> 11:10.650
we need to win!

11:13.440 --> 11:14.780
Everyone gather 'round!

11:14.780 --> 11:15.610
Huddle up!

11:18.990 --> 11:20.580
C'mon, that means you too!

11:20.580 --> 11:21.540
What?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.870
Karasuno, fight!

11:25.870 --> 11:27.080
Yeah!

11:33.170 --> 11:36.880
Hey, don't tell me your stomach is hurting again.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.800
I-I'm quivering in ancipation!

11:38.800 --> 11:39.760
Excuse me?!

11:39.760 --> 11:41.970
I think he's "quivering in anticipation."

11:41.970 --> 11:44.390
Nah. He's just quivering, period.

11:44.390 --> 11:47.230
I get it! The sight of Date Tech freaked you out!

11:47.230 --> 11:49.730
Of course it did—I mean didn't—I mean did!

11:49.730 --> 11:51.070
Make up your mind!

11:51.070 --> 11:54.030
<i>Shit. He's being overwhelmed again.</i>

11:54.030 --> 11:56.200
<i>We've got to do something quick,</i>

11:57.490 --> 12:00.370
<i>or it'll be the match against Seijou all over again.</i>

12:02.240 --> 12:05.960
You're just as wimpy, but you
 don't look that nervous, Asahi.

12:05.960 --> 12:08.040
Wimpy?

12:08.040 --> 12:10.830
There's a trick to get rid of the jitters.

12:11.420 --> 12:14.250
Recall an experience that scared the living daylights out of you.

12:14.250 --> 12:16.090
The scarier the better.

12:16.090 --> 12:20.010
It'll remind you that there are scarier things out there, so you can handle this.

12:20.760 --> 12:23.600
<i>Something that scared the living daylights out of me?</i>

12:35.730 --> 12:36.280
Hinata?

12:36.280 --> 12:38.740
Hey, I think I'm okay now.

12:38.740 --> 12:40.240
Hinata, what's wrong?!

12:40.610 --> 12:45.580
If you had a coping strategy, why did you get so bummed the last time we took on Date Tech?

12:46.910 --> 12:50.460
Noya, stop pouring salt and pepper into his wounds like that.

12:50.790 --> 12:53.880
I had no time to daydream like that.

12:53.880 --> 12:58.630
It takes time and concentration and other conditions to daydream!

12:58.630 --> 12:59.800
Too much work.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.640
Okay, are you ready?

13:03.140 --> 13:05.350
It's our first match! We need to warm up.

13:05.350 --> 13:06.560
Yes, sir!

13:07.220 --> 13:08.930
<i>Finally, an official match!</i>

13:10.100 --> 13:10.140
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

13:10.140 --> 13:10.190

13:27.950 --> 13:30.410
{=6}<b>Aspire to Go Forward</b>

13:43.760 --> 13:45.010
It's so spacious!

13:45.010 --> 13:46.350
It's so huge!

13:46.350 --> 13:48.640
Hey, no freaking out.

13:49.430 --> 13:50.480
You're the freak.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.020
You're the only freak here!

13:52.020 --> 13:54.310
D-Don't get so mad at me!

13:58.480 --> 14:01.450
Fly

13:58.480 --> 14:01.450
Fly

14:05.660 --> 14:08.540
All righty, then! Let's start practice!

14:08.540 --> 14:10.000
Yessir!

14:13.170 --> 14:15.420
We need another look at them.

14:15.710 --> 14:19.380
I want to see the Karasuno first-year duo's fast attack.

14:19.380 --> 14:20.130
Yes, sir.

14:24.340 --> 14:25.930
It's Aoba Jousai.

14:25.930 --> 14:27.430
They're tall.

14:27.430 --> 14:29.430
They really do look tough.

14:29.430 --> 14:32.850
The one who's most central to their team is their setter...

14:33.520 --> 14:35.480
Hey, I don't see him.

14:37.060 --> 14:38.440
Where is Oikawa?

14:39.400 --> 14:41.030
W-Well...

14:41.030 --> 14:42.690
Come on, out with it.

14:43.150 --> 14:46.450
He's been held up outside by girls from other schools.

14:43.740 --> 14:44.990
He's amazing!

14:44.990 --> 14:46.450
He's so cool!

14:48.700 --> 14:49.870
Iwaizumi.

14:49.870 --> 14:50.790
Yes, sir.

14:53.250 --> 14:56.330
Hey, these are good! Did you really make them yourself?

14:56.330 --> 14:58.920
Yes! I stayed up late last night to make them!

14:58.920 --> 15:01.210
Wow, that's awesome! Thanks!

15:01.210 --> 15:02.590
It was nothing, really!

15:02.590 --> 15:05.590
Oikawa, can I please take a photo with you?

15:05.880 --> 15:08.350
What, a photo? But of course!

15:10.560 --> 15:12.270
Oikawa?

15:12.270 --> 15:16.730
Ow! I've never been hit before, even by my coach!

15:21.650 --> 15:23.530
Sorry, we'll take that photo another time.

15:23.530 --> 15:25.400
Aw...

15:29.620 --> 15:31.450
Hey! It's turnip head!

15:32.290 --> 15:34.080
What's a "turnip head"?

15:34.080 --> 15:36.000
You are. Who else could it be?

15:36.000 --> 15:36.540
Wha?

15:37.330 --> 15:37.830
And...

15:37.830 --> 15:38.880
Yoo-hoo!

15:39.420 --> 15:41.040
Tobio and Small Fry.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.380
Having fun with your deviant combination?

15:43.380 --> 15:44.460
Great King!

15:44.460 --> 15:45.760
Ow!

15:45.760 --> 15:47.890
That hurt, Iwa.

15:47.890 --> 15:48.340
Huh?

15:49.010 --> 15:49.850
You have a libero now.

15:49.850 --> 15:50.800
Gimme another ball!

15:50.800 --> 15:53.100
You didn't when we had our practice match.

15:53.970 --> 15:56.310
They seem to have more big guys now too.

15:54.770 --> 15:56.310
Please pass me another ball!

15:56.310 --> 15:57.440
What's this?

15:57.440 --> 16:01.940
They also have a new instructor, I think.

15:58.730 --> 16:02.610
Hey, we have a limited amount of time, so keep hitting those!

16:02.610 --> 16:04.360
Hinata, pick up your feet!

16:04.860 --> 16:08.110
New players and a new instructor.

16:08.110 --> 16:11.120
How has Karasuno changed?

16:12.830 --> 16:14.040
It's finally happening.

16:14.870 --> 16:20.000
Our team is going to play in this enormous, packed venue.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
I think I'm getting nervous just looking at this.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.010
That's precisely why...

16:26.050 --> 16:29.840
we need to do what we can, to the best of our ability.

16:29.840 --> 16:30.640
Yes, sir.

16:31.390 --> 16:32.640
One, two...

16:34.640 --> 16:35.770
I'm going!

16:35.770 --> 16:36.850
<i>Date Tech.</i>

16:38.100 --> 16:38.980
Asahi!

16:40.310 --> 16:42.730
Date Tech seriously worries me too.

16:42.730 --> 16:44.400
I have no intention of losing.

16:44.400 --> 16:47.150
I'm only thinking of winning. That's precisely why...

16:49.450 --> 16:52.410
we need to focus on the opponent in front of us.

16:52.410 --> 16:53.080
Right.

16:55.080 --> 16:55.620
Captains!

16:59.290 --> 17:01.170
Let's have a good match.

17:06.380 --> 17:09.090
<b>Together we can make the flowers of effort bloom</b>

17:06.380 --> 17:09.090
<b>Together we can make the flowers of effort bloom</b>

17:11.010 --> 17:12.010
Gather 'round!

17:12.340 --> 17:13.470
Form a line!

17:56.640 --> 17:58.520
Let's have a good match!

18:03.770 --> 18:13.780
Go, go, let's go! Let's go, Date Tech!

18:06.860 --> 18:12.820
<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

18:06.860 --> 18:12.820
<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

18:13.780 --> 18:15.780
Now listen! This is the first match of the tournament.

18:16.330 --> 18:19.790
This would make anyone nervous enough to throw off their game!

18:19.790 --> 18:22.500
Our challenge is to shake it off before they do.

18:22.870 --> 18:25.630
We need to start by scoring one point to get into the rhythm!

18:25.630 --> 18:26.670
Yessir!

18:26.670 --> 18:29.630
What I'm about to say is neither flattery nor loyalty.

18:30.630 --> 18:32.300
You're all good.

18:32.300 --> 18:33.880
Karasuno has a good team!

18:33.880 --> 18:37.890
Let's show the entire stadium that 
"the clipped crows" can fly once again!

18:37.890 --> 18:41.060
Whoa! Take's brought out the buzzwords!

18:41.060 --> 18:45.440
I'll bet anything they're saying that infamous nickname right now.

18:46.020 --> 18:48.940
<i>"The fallen champs, the clipped crows."</i>

18:49.360 --> 18:50.980
And then we'll say to them...

18:50.980 --> 18:54.320
Observe! The old warhorse, Karasuno, is back!

18:54.320 --> 18:55.410
Yessir!

18:57.370 --> 18:59.330
Was it too poetic?! Did it gross you out?!

18:59.330 --> 19:00.790
It's okay! Don't worry!

19:00.790 --> 19:02.870
What's an old warhorse?

19:02.870 --> 19:04.920
You think I know?

19:04.920 --> 19:09.090
It's not strictly accurate, but it basically implies "We were strong once."

19:09.090 --> 19:10.550
Hey! We're going!

19:11.760 --> 19:13.840
Karasuno, fight!

19:13.840 --> 19:15.470
Yessir!

19:16.840 --> 19:19.220
Calm down and get that first point.

19:19.220 --> 19:22.180
It's okay. The time we spent training won't let us down!

19:22.680 --> 19:24.600
Make your receiving skills count.

19:24.600 --> 19:25.770
Yessir!

19:26.770 --> 19:30.230
What the heck? Is that number ten their middle blocker?

19:30.520 --> 19:33.030
He can't be more than 160 cm.

19:33.030 --> 19:35.700
They have taller guys on the bench.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.950
Their opponent is confused.

19:38.950 --> 19:40.410
Which is only natural.

19:40.780 --> 19:44.120
Who'd put him up for middle blocker where you fight for height?

19:44.410 --> 19:47.120
Is that tiny number ten really a starter?

19:47.120 --> 19:48.580
He isn't a libero.

19:48.580 --> 19:51.000
Those who mock will pay the piper.

19:52.090 --> 19:53.510
Spoken like an expert!

19:53.510 --> 19:56.260
I'll force him into submission next time.

19:58.720 --> 20:00.050
Now, bring it!

20:00.640 --> 20:02.010
Komaki, give us a nice serve!

20:03.140 --> 20:03.600
Asahi!

20:03.970 --> 20:04.810
Got it!

20:05.140 --> 20:05.850
<i>It's our first shot.</i>

20:05.850 --> 20:06.890
Nice receive!

20:06.890 --> 20:08.150
<i>Who do I use?</i>

20:08.150 --> 20:11.400
<i>Who will spook our opponent and boost our morale?</i>

20:12.270 --> 20:14.480
<i>The first shot has to be his!</i>

20:14.780 --> 20:16.450
Yo, heave-ho!

20:22.160 --> 20:23.030
Nice, Tanaka.

20:23.030 --> 20:25.450
Take that!

20:25.450 --> 20:26.580
It's a good start.

20:27.410 --> 20:29.370
Knock it off already!

20:31.960 --> 20:33.750
Karasuno already got a warning!

20:33.750 --> 20:35.800
That was fast. Boy, they're dumb.

20:35.800 --> 20:39.260
It's okay! Let's switch gears and give it back to them!

20:39.260 --> 20:41.180
Be calm and take back that point!

20:42.180 --> 20:43.560
Tanaka, give us a good one!

20:43.560 --> 20:45.310
It's that cueball!

20:45.810 --> 20:46.680
Okay.

20:46.680 --> 20:47.310
Nice receive!

20:47.730 --> 20:48.190
Ikejiri!

20:53.940 --> 20:55.860
Whoa, he dug it out!

20:55.860 --> 20:57.740
That libero has fast reflexes!

20:57.740 --> 20:59.650
<i>Shit, it didn't go back to our setter!</i>

21:00.160 --> 21:00.990
Asahi!

21:01.620 --> 21:03.200
The left wing spiker is coming! Triple up!

21:03.530 --> 21:04.740
We're counting on you, ace!

21:11.370 --> 21:13.630
Wow! That's a grown man for you!

21:13.630 --> 21:15.920
I hear he was held back five years!

21:15.920 --> 21:17.960
For real?! Is that allowed?

21:17.960 --> 21:19.470
Maybe he lies about his age.

21:19.470 --> 21:21.050
Asahi, pull it together!

21:21.680 --> 21:24.930
Whoa, that had some real power to it.

21:24.930 --> 21:25.510
Yes.

21:26.010 --> 21:28.230
Did you witness the power of our left wing spiker?

21:29.640 --> 21:33.520
But we have many more weapons up our sleeves.

21:37.400 --> 21:39.030
Shut up! I know!

21:40.030 --> 21:41.660
Tanaka, do another one of those!

21:42.820 --> 21:43.660
I got it!

21:44.910 --> 21:46.740
You're all good.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.160
Karasuno has a good team!

21:53.540 --> 21:56.040
