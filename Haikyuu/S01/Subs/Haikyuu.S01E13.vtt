<i>One more time!</i>

00:04.230 --> 00:06.900
<i>Leave the ball for Hinata at the highest striking point</i>

00:06.900 --> 00:09.530
<i>in the split-second he pauses at the summit!</i>

00:10.620 --> 00:13.700

00:19.620 --> 00:21.830
The heat flickers

00:21.830 --> 00:24.170
Sweat glitters on my skin

00:24.170 --> 00:29.050
Shouts echo and shoulders hit

00:29.050 --> 00:33.720
We asked the sky through the open window

00:41.560 --> 00:44.150
The chance is there

00:44.570 --> 00:46.150
Come on, come on, come on

00:46.150 --> 00:48.320
Do it together

00:50.240 --> 00:54.830
Everybody always wants to stand there,

00:54.830 --> 00:59.540
make mistakes, get angry, and struggle

00:59.540 --> 01:00.870
We'll never give up

01:00.870 --> 01:04.340
We don't want it to end

01:04.340 --> 01:09.840
I will continue on with my imagination

01:11.340 --> 01:16.060
I want to struggle and fall and become stronger

01:16.060 --> 01:20.810
I want to persevere, stand back up, do it again,

01:20.810 --> 01:22.100
and never give up

01:22.100 --> 01:25.400
Let me run

01:25.400 --> 01:31.240
I will run to where my imagination leads me

Episode Thirteen:
Worthy Adversaries

01:48.630 --> 01:50.760
<i>Damn. My set was slightly too high!</i>

01:52.840 --> 01:53.430
Captain!

01:54.930 --> 01:56.550
Nice save, Daichi!

01:56.550 --> 01:57.310
It's over the net!

01:57.310 --> 01:57.890
Forward!

01:59.430 --> 02:00.220
Nice, Inuoka!

02:00.220 --> 02:01.100
Come at me!

02:01.100 --> 02:01.600
Tora.

02:01.980 --> 02:04.440
We're going in, Hinata! One, two...

02:05.690 --> 02:06.900
Yes!

02:09.570 --> 02:11.610
Kai, nice cover!

02:10.070 --> 02:14.360
Wow, both teams' worker drones are doing good work.

02:14.360 --> 02:19.540
They may not be spectacular, but it's guys like them who keep the ball in play that really make a match.

02:19.910 --> 02:22.870
Kenma, gimme another!

02:23.330 --> 02:26.750
They can say our offensive power is average all they want!

02:26.750 --> 02:29.670
I'm still the ace of Nekoma!

02:30.840 --> 02:32.340
Yes!

02:32.340 --> 02:33.510
Shit!

02:33.880 --> 02:37.350
Taketora is more psyched up than usual.

02:37.350 --> 02:41.220
Maybe it's because there's someone a lot like himself on the other team.

02:41.680 --> 02:46.690
Or maybe he's being influenced by the battle between Inuoka and their number ten?

02:47.480 --> 02:52.070
Hinata and Kageyama's fast attacks just aren't lining up.

02:52.070 --> 02:57.370
Unlike the deviant fast attacks they've been doing, 
where Kageyama aligns perfectly to Hinata's moves,

02:57.370 --> 03:00.910
now they're attempting to do normal fast attacks.

03:01.410 --> 03:04.750
What Hinata needs is technical improvement.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.330
You're still tensing up.

03:04.330 --> 03:06.420
Your timing is slower than usual.

03:04.750 --> 03:08.630
The only way to do that is conditioning through repetition.

03:09.500 --> 03:14.010
But if he does manage to learn how to use it effectively...

03:14.010 --> 03:17.260
...then they will no longer be "a demon and his iron club."

03:18.220 --> 03:20.390
They will be "demon" and "demon."

03:21.720 --> 03:23.930
Karasuno               Nekoma

03:21.720 --> 03:23.930
Karasuno               Nekoma

03:22.180 --> 03:23.470
Give us a good serve!

03:27.480 --> 03:29.860
<i>Which do I use on it? Over or under?</i>

03:31.110 --> 03:32.190
Cover it!

03:32.900 --> 03:33.530
Ryuu!

03:33.530 --> 03:34.740
You got it.

03:34.740 --> 03:40.160
Asahi ain't the only one who can pull his weight in a crunch!

03:42.080 --> 03:43.450
He blew away the blockers!

03:43.450 --> 03:47.420
Boo-yah, boo-yah, boo-yah, boo-yaw!

03:51.590 --> 03:53.800
<i>I'm not gonna keep getting stopped either!</i>

03:53.800 --> 03:54.880
<i>I'll stop them!</i>

03:55.670 --> 03:59.840
Hinata, Kageyama told you not to tense up so much, remember?

03:59.840 --> 04:01.260
Keep your eyes wide open.

04:01.260 --> 04:02.310
Y-Yes, sir!

04:04.560 --> 04:05.810
Fukunaga!

04:08.100 --> 04:10.190
<i>The stocky guy with a crew cut is coming forward!</i>

04:10.190 --> 04:11.230
<i>It's a fast attack!</i>

04:11.230 --> 04:12.520
<i>Keep your eyes wide open.</i>

04:14.730 --> 04:16.280
<i>Number seven from behind number two?!</i>

04:21.200 --> 04:22.490
Nice job getting a hand on it!

04:22.490 --> 04:23.080
Here's our chance!

04:25.660 --> 04:26.330
He's fast!

04:27.750 --> 04:29.500
Nekoma's number seven also has fast reflexes!

04:30.370 --> 04:34.210
They influence one another in a back-and-forth match

04:34.500 --> 04:38.340
and occasionally draw out more power than their talent allows.

04:38.630 --> 04:40.800
These are true worthy adversaries.

04:43.760 --> 04:44.720
He got past!

04:44.720 --> 04:45.310
It's in!

04:45.310 --> 04:47.180
All right!

04:47.180 --> 04:48.850
<i>It's still a little too high.</i>

04:51.310 --> 04:52.730
One more!

04:58.150 --> 04:59.900
Right on!

04:59.900 --> 05:01.280
Shit!

05:01.280 --> 05:03.240
Karasuno               Nekoma

05:01.280 --> 05:03.240
Karasuno               Nekoma

05:02.240 --> 05:04.950
I don't want them to hit 20 points before we do.

05:05.910 --> 05:07.250
Inuoka, serve!

05:07.250 --> 05:08.160
Coming up!

05:12.880 --> 05:17.920
<i>When Tall McSpiky goes to the back row, Rooster Head takes the front row.</i>

05:18.630 --> 05:20.550
<i>I like playing with Tall McSpiky,</i>

05:21.220 --> 05:23.180
<i>but this guy scares me.</i>

05:23.180 --> 05:27.770
You're more than a match for Inuoka, who stands 20 cm taller than you.

05:27.770 --> 05:29.930
That's amazing, Small Fry.

05:30.730 --> 05:33.230
You're the small fry, Small Fry!

05:34.150 --> 05:35.440
Hey.

05:35.440 --> 05:36.610
What're you...

05:37.400 --> 05:39.530
We're going to do the usual fast attack next.

05:39.530 --> 05:42.360
What? You mean the hard one, not the soft one?

05:42.360 --> 05:42.990
Yes.

05:43.410 --> 05:47.990
What? But I'm just starting to
 get used to doing the soft one.

05:47.990 --> 05:49.200
No.

05:49.580 --> 05:51.910
Not while he's in the front row.

05:52.250 --> 05:53.250
How come?

05:53.250 --> 05:54.250
Just because.

05:54.250 --> 05:54.920
Huh?

05:54.920 --> 05:56.210
It's a hunch.

05:57.380 --> 05:59.130
Give us a good serve, Inuoka!

06:02.930 --> 06:03.630
All right!

06:03.630 --> 06:04.550
Yes!

06:05.680 --> 06:07.850
I really do love this sensation!

06:08.220 --> 06:10.140
That was a good decision.

06:10.140 --> 06:10.810
Huh?

06:10.810 --> 06:14.770
Sorry, guys. I didn't see it coming.

06:11.230 --> 06:16.270
I think for now, their deviant fast attack is more effective on Nekota's third-year middle blocker.

06:14.770 --> 06:16.270
Shake it off, Kuro!

06:16.770 --> 06:22.740
A normal fast attack would obviously be easier for their adept middle blocker to block.

06:22.740 --> 06:24.990
Okay, I serve next.

06:22.740 --> 06:24.990
He really is amazing.

06:24.990 --> 06:27.240
Hey, hit it inside the lines this time.

06:24.990 --> 06:28.700
He's the dictionary definition of the word "superhuman."

06:27.240 --> 06:28.700
I know that!

06:28.700 --> 06:30.160
All right, then.

06:30.580 --> 06:31.950
Let's take it back.

06:33.410 --> 06:35.080
Hinata, give us a nice serve!

06:36.960 --> 06:38.420
Nice receive!

06:39.460 --> 06:41.840
Yikes, it's all jumbled somehow.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.090
Who will it be?

06:43.090 --> 06:46.550
They should leave it to the one who can hit it the hardest. Number four!

06:48.300 --> 06:49.720
A back row attack!

06:50.100 --> 06:51.430
<i>The front three were a ruse!</i>

06:51.890 --> 06:53.810
<i>They completely shook off our blockers!</i>

06:56.520 --> 06:57.690
Here's our chance to score!

06:58.770 --> 06:59.770
Who'll get it this time?

07:02.610 --> 07:03.650
<i>A quick attack!</i>

07:04.400 --> 07:05.200
All right!

07:05.200 --> 07:06.360
In the blink of an eye!

07:06.660 --> 07:10.580
That fast attack looks really consistent.

07:11.200 --> 07:14.540
My perception may be off from being exposed to Hinata's erratic moves.

07:11.660 --> 07:14.040
Okay, I'm serving next!

07:14.540 --> 07:16.750
Karasuno               Nekoma

07:14.540 --> 07:16.750
Karasuno               Nekoma

07:15.250 --> 07:16.750
Give us a nice serve, Yamamoto!

07:18.960 --> 07:19.670
Crap!

07:20.000 --> 07:20.960
Sorry, cover it!

07:20.960 --> 07:21.920
I'm open!

07:21.920 --> 07:22.630
Asahi!

07:26.630 --> 07:28.340
<i>Who'll make the next attack?!</i>

07:28.680 --> 07:29.800
<i>Another quick attack?!</i>

07:31.560 --> 07:32.140
<i>He isn't jumping!</i>

07:35.480 --> 07:37.400
All right!

07:37.400 --> 07:38.810
What just happened?

07:39.480 --> 07:41.230
A delayed spike.

07:41.230 --> 07:43.150
You act like you're about to jump for a quick attack

07:43.480 --> 07:45.860
to throw off the opponents' block timing, and then hit.

07:46.360 --> 07:49.530
This attack hasn't been that popular recently.

07:50.370 --> 07:54.080
I'm impressed they threw it in right after their quick attack.

07:54.080 --> 07:55.000
Nice set!

07:55.000 --> 07:55.710
They're good.

07:55.710 --> 07:56.790
Nice spike, Kuro!

07:56.790 --> 07:59.500
Karasuno               Nekoma

07:56.790 --> 07:59.500
Karasuno               Nekoma

07:57.290 --> 07:59.500
Nekoma's made it to 20 points.

07:59.830 --> 08:02.210
Five more will end it.

08:02.210 --> 08:04.090
This is bad.

08:04.090 --> 08:07.380
I've already used both of our timeouts.

08:09.430 --> 08:12.510
Aw, shit! The guy is grinning at me!

08:12.510 --> 08:19.940
Ever since their number one got up to the front row, 
their attacks seem to have more of a sense of proficiency.

08:19.940 --> 08:21.900
You're right.

08:21.900 --> 08:24.400
Half of their starting lineup is made up of first-years.

08:24.400 --> 08:28.950
If you called us level one with our newly assembled team,

08:29.280 --> 08:31.910
that would put them 10 or 20 levels higher.

08:29.660 --> 08:31.280
Yamamoto, give us a nice serve!

08:31.280 --> 08:31.910
Go for it!

08:32.320 --> 08:37.410
So they're a full-grown adult cat, 
and we're a freshly-hatched baby crow.

08:37.410 --> 08:39.710
Yeah, that. Good description.

08:41.130 --> 08:45.500
No matter how we struggle against their versatile range of offense and defense, we can't possibly win.

08:46.630 --> 08:48.470
Not today, anyway.

08:49.180 --> 08:49.840
Which means...

08:51.680 --> 08:53.550
Our only option is persistence and tenacity!

08:53.850 --> 08:56.270
Attack them with power and speed!

08:56.680 --> 08:59.020
You want us to force them into submission?!

08:59.350 --> 09:01.560
That makes us sound like the bad guys.

09:02.770 --> 09:04.900
What's wrong with being the bad guys?

09:04.900 --> 09:07.690
You normally think of a crow as the bad guy!

09:07.690 --> 09:09.950
Ukai, your face scares me!

09:10.280 --> 09:14.330
Let it ride with our sloppy fast attacks, receives, and power plays!

09:14.330 --> 09:17.410
Those are your weapons, you unrefined, klutzy slobs!

09:17.910 --> 09:20.120
Bombard them with all the weaponry in your arsenal!

09:20.460 --> 09:21.580
Hit them!

09:21.580 --> 09:24.500
Hit them, and hit them hard!

09:28.710 --> 09:31.470
Okay! Nice block, Tsukishima!

09:31.470 --> 09:32.890
Tsukki, nice!

09:32.890 --> 09:35.850
Karasuno               Nekoma

09:32.890 --> 09:35.850
Karasuno               Nekoma

09:33.260 --> 09:34.680
Shake it off, Inuoka!

09:34.680 --> 09:35.850
I'm sorry!

09:36.390 --> 09:38.470
Now Karasuno has hit 20 points!

09:38.470 --> 09:41.560
Karasuno has taken the momentum to press their advantage.

09:44.810 --> 09:46.690
Anybody flustered?

09:46.690 --> 09:47.730
No, sir!

09:48.070 --> 09:49.650
Good.

09:49.650 --> 09:51.820
Keep that ball in play.

09:51.820 --> 09:52.740
Yes, sir!

09:57.160 --> 10:00.120
Karasuno               Nekoma

09:57.160 --> 10:00.120
Karasuno               Nekoma

09:58.080 --> 09:59.540
All right!

09:59.540 --> 10:00.120
Good!

10:00.500 --> 10:01.830
One more point and we're tied!

10:01.830 --> 10:03.790
K-K-Keep going!

10:04.290 --> 10:06.130
Chill out and stop them from scoring.

10:06.130 --> 10:07.000
Yes, sir!

10:11.300 --> 10:12.470
Yes!

10:12.470 --> 10:14.260
It's upon us when you least expect it!

10:14.260 --> 10:16.470
Karasuno               Nekoma

10:14.260 --> 10:16.470
Karasuno               Nekoma

10:14.640 --> 10:16.470
Match point for Nekoma.

10:16.470 --> 10:17.680
One more point!

10:17.680 --> 10:18.310
Yessir!

10:18.310 --> 10:19.140
<i>Shit!</i>

10:19.720 --> 10:21.850
<i>Don't they ever get flustered?!</i>

10:22.730 --> 10:25.190
<i>That's a grown-up cat for you.</i>

10:25.190 --> 10:26.560
It's all right!

10:27.860 --> 10:30.650
Our team is still sharp!

10:32.070 --> 10:32.110
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:32.110 --> 10:32.150
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:32.150 --> 10:32.190
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:32.150 --> 10:32.190
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:32.190 --> 10:32.240
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:32.190 --> 10:32.240
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:32.240 --> 10:32.280
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:32.240 --> 10:32.280
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:32.280 --> 10:39.030
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:32.280 --> 10:39.030
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:39.030 --> 10:39.030
{Part B}

10:39.160 --> 10:39.200
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:39.200 --> 10:39.240
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:39.240 --> 10:39.290
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:39.240 --> 10:39.290
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:39.290 --> 10:39.330
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:39.290 --> 10:39.330
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:39.330 --> 10:39.370
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:39.330 --> 10:39.370
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:39.370 --> 10:46.040
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:39.370 --> 10:46.040
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:47.040 --> 10:48.500
Yes!

10:48.500 --> 10:51.800
We'll claw our way to a tie!

10:51.800 --> 10:54.010
You're not getting past me!

10:58.100 --> 10:59.600
Right on!

10:58.890 --> 11:00.850
Karasuno               Nekoma

10:58.890 --> 11:00.850
Karasuno               Nekoma

11:02.220 --> 11:05.770
Now their number three is up in the front row.

11:06.440 --> 11:10.230
<i>We have our middle blockers, who are so pivotal to blocking, working at 100%.</i>

11:10.690 --> 11:14.450
<i>On top of that, Hinata can score points by going around their blockers,</i>

11:15.280 --> 11:18.160
<i>and Azumane is currently in the best position for scoring.</i>

11:19.870 --> 11:22.620
<i>Having both of them in the front row, right now,</i>

11:22.620 --> 11:25.120
<i>is our biggest opportunity to turn the match around!</i>

11:25.120 --> 11:27.750
If we get a point now, it's a deuce.

11:27.750 --> 11:28.830
Yes.

11:28.830 --> 11:31.550
A deuce would give us the opportunity to turn the match around!

11:32.130 --> 11:34.510
This one ball is crucial.

11:34.880 --> 11:35.880
Nice receive!

11:36.930 --> 11:39.390
<i>Hinata's fast attacks are still dodgy.</i>

11:39.390 --> 11:40.550
<i>I have to choose.</i>

11:42.310 --> 11:42.890
Go!

11:45.850 --> 11:47.390
Aw, he dug it out.

11:47.390 --> 11:48.230
But...

11:48.480 --> 11:50.440
It's coming back! We still have a chance!

11:50.810 --> 11:51.900
Shit. I'm sorry!

11:51.900 --> 11:53.860
Azumane, just spike it!

11:53.860 --> 11:54.820
Oh crap!

11:56.530 --> 11:57.740
Swat it down, Asahi!

12:00.240 --> 12:01.450
They retrieved it again!

12:02.450 --> 12:04.160
It's their chance to score again.

12:04.540 --> 12:05.750
That's fine.

12:05.750 --> 12:06.710
What?

12:06.710 --> 12:10.380
It may not look that good, and it wasn't any kind of attack,

12:10.670 --> 12:13.800
but as long as the ball is kept in play, you can't lose.

12:14.340 --> 12:15.670
Here's our chance!

12:18.720 --> 12:20.390
<i>There's something about Hinata.</i>

12:20.840 --> 12:22.850
<i>It's the same as when I first played against him.</i>

12:24.140 --> 12:26.890
<i>That last-minute, larger-than-life presence!</i>

12:27.980 --> 12:31.110
<i>He's saying, "I'm right here. Send it to me."</i>

12:32.560 --> 12:33.610
<i>He's calling for it!</i>

12:42.410 --> 12:43.410
All right!

12:47.120 --> 12:51.750
The team with the more powerful spike does not win.

12:58.970 --> 13:01.970
The team who lets the ball touch the ground loses.

13:09.390 --> 13:10.310
This is what it means

13:11.730 --> 13:13.730
to keep the ball in play.

13:15.690 --> 13:18.860
Right on!

13:15.690 --> 13:17.650
Karasuno               Nekoma

13:15.690 --> 13:17.650
Karasuno               Nekoma

13:22.570 --> 13:23.570
Aw...

13:24.660 --> 13:27.080
We didn't make that many mistakes,

13:27.700 --> 13:30.080
and we utilized the most powerful weapons in our arsenal.

13:31.670 --> 13:33.500
But we didn't win.

13:35.290 --> 13:40.470
That must be a team trained as 
a team rather than as individuals.

13:40.470 --> 13:41.510
I accept defeat.

13:43.890 --> 13:44.930
One more time!

13:47.010 --> 13:48.350
Let's play

13:49.430 --> 13:50.310
one more time!

13:51.140 --> 13:53.100
Yeah, I plan to do just that!

13:53.900 --> 13:57.780
Practice matches are all about playing all over again.

13:59.110 --> 14:00.530
Nice location!

14:00.530 --> 14:02.320
Let 'er fly!

14:02.320 --> 14:03.490
One more!

14:05.240 --> 14:08.700
May 6th   Fair Weather

14:05.240 --> 14:08.700
May 6th   Fair Weather

14:05.240 --> 14:08.700
Karasuno High Proceeds to Athletic Park

14:05.240 --> 14:08.700
Karasuno High Proceeds to Athletic Park

14:05.240 --> 14:08.700
Begin warmup

14:05.240 --> 14:08.700
Begin warmup

14:05.240 --> 14:08.700
Begin practice match

14:05.240 --> 14:08.700
Begin practice match

14:05.240 --> 14:08.700
Karasuno

14:05.240 --> 14:08.700
Karasuno

14:05.240 --> 14:08.700
Nekoma

14:05.240 --> 14:08.700
Nekoma

14:06.280 --> 14:08.700
Now we've been thrashed beyond a shadow of a doubt.

14:09.290 --> 14:13.420
Now they're truly exhausted.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.130
One more time!

14:15.500 --> 14:16.420
What?!

14:16.420 --> 14:19.840
You haven't stopped moving the entire time! 
What batteries are you using?!

14:20.170 --> 14:22.050
Hey, knock it off!

14:22.050 --> 14:24.220
They have to catch the bullet train!

14:25.840 --> 14:27.050
Gather 'round!

14:30.560 --> 14:35.810
His grandfather and I have had a lengthy acquaintance.

14:35.810 --> 14:39.690
We used to have our teams play lots of practice matches.

14:39.690 --> 14:42.400
It was always a pretty good contest.

14:42.780 --> 14:43.860
However...

14:45.490 --> 14:46.820
Retiring?

14:46.820 --> 14:49.490
<i>Old age has caught up with me.</i>

14:50.370 --> 14:51.330
<i>Sorry.</i>

14:51.330 --> 14:53.160
Really?

14:53.870 --> 14:59.800
Oh well. I'm sure we won't be hard up for practice match opponents, with or without you around.

15:03.170 --> 15:07.760
Good rivals just aren't that easy to find.

15:08.300 --> 15:14.480
Later, I heard that old man Ukai fell ill soon after coming out of retirement.

15:14.480 --> 15:18.150
I was sure that Karasuno would never come back from that.

15:19.570 --> 15:23.070
However, to be honest, you have more talent than I imagined.

15:23.070 --> 15:24.820
Especially in the attacking department.

15:24.820 --> 15:27.410
The number nine, number ten fast attack.

15:27.410 --> 15:30.240
I doubt many can prevent that attack.

15:30.870 --> 15:34.580
I also believe that your two left wing spikers are powerful weapons.

15:35.290 --> 15:38.250
Now it's up to how long you keep the ball in play.

15:38.250 --> 15:39.420
Yes, sir!

15:39.420 --> 15:43.380
As a team, you're rough and need more practice.

15:43.380 --> 15:46.340
But you have overwhelming potential.

15:46.340 --> 15:49.390
I'm sure you will improve greatly with the appropriate training.

15:49.800 --> 15:52.010
I'm really glad to see this.

15:53.470 --> 15:56.310
We have a worthy rival once again.

15:57.350 --> 15:59.270
I'll see you next at nationals.

16:00.310 --> 16:04.740
In that shiny, spotless, huge gymnasium,

16:04.740 --> 16:08.240
whirling with emotions and full of spectators.

16:08.610 --> 16:12.950
And we'll have our greatest 
Battle of the Garbage Dumpster ever!

16:13.330 --> 16:14.240
Yes, sir!

16:14.910 --> 16:17.920
Okay, now let's get this all put away!

16:17.920 --> 16:18.870
Yessir!

16:18.870 --> 16:20.000
You shit!

16:20.000 --> 16:21.340
You piece of poo!

16:21.340 --> 16:23.300
Hey, get this put away!

16:21.340 --> 16:23.300
Equipment Room

16:21.340 --> 16:23.300
Equipment Room

16:24.500 --> 16:25.710
Hey!

16:26.880 --> 16:27.970
Huh?

16:27.970 --> 16:31.720
What's up, eh? You wanna rumble again? Eh?

16:31.720 --> 16:34.060
Eh, city boy?

16:34.060 --> 16:36.180
Um, actually...

16:37.020 --> 16:38.190
It's about your...

16:38.980 --> 16:42.690
Your man... Your female manager...

16:42.690 --> 16:44.900
What is your manager's name?

16:47.820 --> 16:48.990
Why, you!

16:48.990 --> 16:53.530
Are you planning to make a move on Kiyo—
I mean, the manager of our team?!

16:53.530 --> 16:56.040
I'll run my fingers through that ruffle of yours!

16:56.540 --> 16:57.200
No.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.500
I do not have the courage to talk to her.

16:59.500 --> 17:02.130
Fukunaga, take care of the mopping there.

17:02.130 --> 17:02.790
Yessir.

17:03.540 --> 17:05.000
Yaku, mop over here.

17:05.000 --> 17:05.750
Yessir.

17:12.180 --> 17:13.600
Kiyoko.

17:13.970 --> 17:16.390
Her name is Shimizu Kiyoko.

17:17.100 --> 17:18.600
My god!

17:18.600 --> 17:20.810
The meaning of her name, clear spring water, is so fitting!

17:20.810 --> 17:22.770
Isn't it, though?!

17:22.770 --> 17:26.320
It also took me quite a while to speak up to her, so I know how you feel.

17:26.860 --> 17:28.030
However...

17:28.360 --> 17:31.990
It's not bad to call out to her and be completely ignored.

17:33.990 --> 17:36.450
No! That bar is set way too high for me!

17:39.160 --> 17:41.920
Well, I'll be! You're not such a bad guy after all!

17:42.830 --> 17:43.880
You too.

17:44.330 --> 17:47.300
I'm Yamamoto Taketora.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.880
Tanaka Ryuunosuke.

17:51.590 --> 17:53.680
How long have you been playing? Who taught you?

17:53.680 --> 17:56.180
How long have you been a setter? Come up with that feint yourself?

17:56.180 --> 17:58.060
Have you been training? Ever hit a brick wall?

17:58.560 --> 18:01.940
<i>Ours is a more "grr"-ing kind of guy.</i>

18:01.940 --> 18:03.020
<i>That's who he meant.</i>

18:05.480 --> 18:07.440
That was incredible, Shouyou!

18:07.440 --> 18:09.230
All those "vrooms" and "swooshes"!

18:09.230 --> 18:11.150
Oh, I'm Inuoka. A first-year.

18:11.570 --> 18:14.870
And you're really tall, 
but you sure can "zoom" and "boom"!

18:14.870 --> 18:17.280
Your "zip" was totally impressive!

18:17.280 --> 18:19.290
Your "ba-zoom" was too!

18:19.290 --> 18:22.250
That "ba-ba-boom" was a real smash hit!

18:22.250 --> 18:26.340
It was more of a "chu-doom" than a "smash"!

18:24.290 --> 18:26.340
What is that conversation?

18:26.340 --> 18:29.500
That isn't the conversation of high schoolers.

18:29.500 --> 18:34.510
But I think you could try goofing 
around more like a high schooler.

18:34.510 --> 18:36.220
I'm not good at it.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.560
You're so young.

18:39.560 --> 18:42.640
I-I'm sorry! I should've been moving faster!

18:42.640 --> 18:44.850
What? No, uh... I'm sorry.

18:43.770 --> 18:46.150
I'm to blame! Please forgive me!

18:46.150 --> 18:47.310
What?! Uh...

18:46.480 --> 18:50.480
That bearded mouse is scaring the freshmen.

18:47.310 --> 18:49.820
Listen! I can really manage that all by myself!

18:49.820 --> 18:51.690
I can't risk harm to your hands!

18:50.480 --> 18:53.530
They look like father and son from where I'm standing.

18:51.690 --> 18:53.200
No, please...

18:53.200 --> 18:56.490
Please let me redeem myself!

18:53.530 --> 18:55.820
They look more like scared kid and his kidnapper to me.

18:59.240 --> 19:02.580
Excuse me, but I'm really getting stared at.

19:02.580 --> 19:04.210
I'm sorry.

19:04.210 --> 19:06.420
Just avert your eyes, and you'll be fine.

19:06.420 --> 19:08.920
Number three, your receives were amazing!

19:09.460 --> 19:14.590
I've never seen anyone dig out spikes from our ace before.

19:14.590 --> 19:20.430
I believe you have amazing talent as a libero on a team with such good receiving skills!

19:21.390 --> 19:23.810
I won't be beaten by you! Excuse me!

19:23.810 --> 19:26.520
Hey, that's too one-sided.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.940
I apologize on his behalf.

19:29.940 --> 19:31.320
He's dangerous.

19:32.150 --> 19:35.450
He's a highly skilled libero himself,

19:35.450 --> 19:39.030
but he's not conceited. He only looks onward and upward.

19:39.450 --> 19:40.830
He's frightening.

19:42.370 --> 19:46.710
Mr. Nekomata, thank you for 
making such a long trip out today.

19:46.710 --> 19:48.670
No, no. Thank you.

19:51.920 --> 19:56.510
It must be difficult to set up practice matches without having the right connections.

19:57.550 --> 19:59.680
Why, you called me multiple times,

19:59.680 --> 20:03.310
and then ended up blurting out you'd visit me in person!

20:04.180 --> 20:06.180
I'm sorry!

20:06.180 --> 20:09.060
But enthusiasm breeds enthusiasm.

20:09.730 --> 20:14.530
Keep on working hard despite your ineptitude, and the students will follow.

20:15.190 --> 20:16.110
Keep it up!

20:17.650 --> 20:19.240
Thank you so much!

20:21.700 --> 20:24.370
I want you to get it together too, Keishin.

20:24.370 --> 20:28.170
'Cause we played three matches and you didn't take a single set.

20:28.540 --> 20:32.130
The next time we play, we'll beat you in straight sets.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.130
Oh, really?

20:34.130 --> 20:37.090
I just hope you're not full of hot air.

20:37.090 --> 20:39.380
Sir, don't provoke him so much.

20:39.380 --> 20:42.100
It's his own damned fault for wearing the old man's face!

20:42.100 --> 20:43.310
That's immature!

20:44.140 --> 20:45.770
U-Ukai!

20:45.770 --> 20:48.770
You said you would only stay on as coach until the Nekoma match.

20:48.770 --> 20:51.020
I can't take that lying down!

20:51.020 --> 20:51.480
What?!

20:51.980 --> 20:54.900
I <i>will</i> take my revenge in a match that really counts!

20:59.110 --> 21:01.070
Comrade! We shall meet again!

21:02.120 --> 21:03.620
What the heck is that?

21:03.620 --> 21:04.660
Beats me.

21:04.660 --> 21:05.540
Avert your eyes.

21:09.750 --> 21:11.330
We won't lose next time.

21:11.330 --> 21:13.540
We won't lose next time either.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.170
Stop it! You're scaring us!

21:15.590 --> 21:18.090
The next time won't go down like it went today.

21:18.090 --> 21:21.050
I really hope so, or it won't be much of a practice match!

21:21.050 --> 21:22.010
It's catching on!

21:22.010 --> 21:23.140
That's so immature!

21:24.010 --> 21:24.930
Kenma!

21:26.010 --> 21:27.430
Shouyou.

21:27.430 --> 21:32.560
Remember when we met on the street the other day, 
and you said you really didn't like volleyball that much?

21:32.560 --> 21:34.440
Oh... yeah.

21:34.770 --> 21:37.400
How about today? How did you like winning?

21:40.610 --> 21:43.620
It was just the same old thing.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.160
Next time,

21:48.080 --> 21:49.870
I'll make you desperate to win,

21:50.960 --> 21:52.420
and we'll win.

21:53.630 --> 21:57.170
And then I'll make you say, 
"I hate losing!" or "That was a blast!"

21:57.170 --> 21:59.090
You'll start talking differently about the match!

22:01.800 --> 22:02.430
Okay.

22:03.180 --> 22:05.100
I'll look forward to that.

22:06.560 --> 22:06.560
{ED}

22:15.190 --> 22:19.150
If I tell you this story,

22:19.150 --> 22:23.030
I wonder if I can explain to you

22:23.360 --> 22:27.330
my feelings

22:27.330 --> 22:30.330
and the distance between us

22:31.040 --> 22:39.000
Standing on an empty field

22:39.340 --> 22:47.930
I breathe out into the night air

22:47.930 --> 22:52.430
Countless times I swore that I would change

22:52.430 --> 22:56.480
I stumbled and fell a lot,

22:56.480 --> 23:00.440
but I swore I would laugh at the end

23:00.440 --> 23:04.360
and not let my tears go to waste

23:04.360 --> 23:08.370
There are so many dreams that can definitely come true

23:08.370 --> 23:12.370
I always sat somewhere, downcast, dejected, depressed,

23:12.370 --> 23:14.870
but still I decided I would fight,

23:14.870 --> 23:19.920
and not let all my frustration go to waste

23:19.920 --> 23:24.260
This is our revenge

23:33.600 --> 23:33.600
{Outro}

23:36.600 --> 23:38.480
If that had been an official match...

23:40.730 --> 23:44.360
it would've been over the instant we lost the very first match.

23:44.360 --> 23:45.610
All of it.

23:51.240 --> 23:52.370
I know.

23:53.660 --> 23:55.500
So you <i>are</i> fully aware.

23:56.540 --> 24:00.920
The official matches, the interhigh prelims, are right around the corner.

24:01.960 --> 24:03.710
We're heading back right away.

24:03.710 --> 24:06.340
We need to reflect upon and analyze today's practice matches!

24:06.800 --> 24:08.340
And then, we practice!

24:09.090 --> 24:10.050
Thank you, sir!

<i>Come to think of it, Kageyama, did you ask the opponents' setter about the technique to feint with his eyes?</i>

24:17.810 --> 24:18.190
<i>No.</i>

24:18.190 --> 24:20.770
<i>Honestly, Kageyama! Are you shy or something?</i>

24:20.770 --> 24:21.610
<i>What's that, moron?!</i>

24:21.610 --> 24:23.780
<i>Ow, ow, ow, ow! Lay off the iron claw!</i>
