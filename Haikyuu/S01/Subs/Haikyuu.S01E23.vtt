WEBVTT

00:06.860 --> 00:08.490
<i>The last set.</i>

00:09.410 --> 00:10.370
Win!

00:10.370 --> 00:11.990
You have to keep winning!

00:16.830 --> 00:18.250
<i>If we drop the ball now...</i>

00:19.620 --> 00:20.500
<i>it's over.</i>

00:21.000 --> 00:21.000
{OP}

00:25.630 --> 00:30.970
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

00:25.630 --> 00:30.970
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

00:35.640 --> 00:42.020
I take two deep breaths and calm my heart

00:42.270 --> 00:48.700
I take a step with my left foot to break the silence

00:49.400 --> 00:55.870
Get your nervousness in check and reign in your mind

00:56.200 --> 00:59.460
You have it in you

00:59.460 --> 01:02.250
You can cast out the demons

01:03.130 --> 01:09.380
Fate? Random chance? Questions? Answers? It's all one

01:09.380 --> 01:11.680
This is the sign

01:16.060 --> 01:17.850
Oh, yeah!

01:17.850 --> 01:20.480
The world is opening to us

01:20.480 --> 01:23.520
We pass the door,

01:23.520 --> 01:29.690
look straight ahead, and never look back

01:29.690 --> 01:31.610
Oh, yeah!

01:31.610 --> 01:37.330
I put my hand to my chest

01:37.330 --> 01:43.460
I can feel the proof that I exist

01:43.460 --> 01:47.590
It is my beating heart

01:51.010 --> 01:51.010
{Part A}

01:51.510 --> 01:53.970
Episode Twenty-three: 
The Play to Shift the Momentum

01:51.510 --> 01:53.970
Episode Twenty-three: 
The Play to Shift the Momentum

01:55.180 --> 01:56.800
Nice receive!

01:58.180 --> 01:58.850
<i>Number ten!</i>

02:01.310 --> 02:05.100
They've probably changed their signal 
for the superhuman fast attack by now.

02:05.520 --> 02:09.570
It's a simple signal, so they can swap it as much as they want.

02:10.030 --> 02:12.740
There still has to be some kind of tell-tale hint.

02:12.740 --> 02:16.570
If he's been tracking the ball, it's a normal fast attack.

02:16.570 --> 02:19.490
And if he dives right in, it's superhuman?

02:19.490 --> 02:22.790
You're right, we should be watching number ten himself.

02:22.790 --> 02:24.080
Yes, sir.

02:24.080 --> 02:24.790
Number ten...

02:24.790 --> 02:27.500
For all his talent, the small fry is just a decoy.

02:27.500 --> 02:30.000
Keep that in mind, okay?

02:30.000 --> 02:30.840
Yes, sir!

02:30.840 --> 02:31.840
Yessir!

02:37.300 --> 02:37.890
Yes!

02:38.220 --> 02:40.350
<i>We can't seem to get it right the first time!</i>

02:40.720 --> 02:42.100
The rally continues.

02:41.390 --> 02:42.100
Here's our chance!

02:42.100 --> 02:45.060
On average, Seijou probably has better defense and blockers.

02:46.730 --> 02:47.270
A diversion!

02:48.610 --> 02:51.480
We have a libero with outstanding defensive skill.

02:48.860 --> 02:50.480
All right!

02:51.780 --> 02:53.190
Asahi!

02:56.160 --> 02:57.740
The setter received it!

02:57.740 --> 02:59.370
He can't make the set!

02:59.370 --> 03:01.120
They won't be able to form much of an attack.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.580
They'll probably go left!

03:03.120 --> 03:04.040
Watacchi!

03:04.370 --> 03:05.000
Yes, sir!

03:11.960 --> 03:16.180
Karasuno                   Aoba Jousai

03:11.960 --> 03:16.180
Karasuno                   Aoba Jousai

03:12.380 --> 03:13.880
All right!

03:13.880 --> 03:16.180
Until now, it was only a hunch.

03:16.180 --> 03:17.220
What?

03:17.220 --> 03:20.640
I think Seijou's libero was originally a setter.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.100
Atta boy!

03:21.180 --> 03:22.720
What do you mean?

03:22.100 --> 03:23.600
Thanks, sir!

03:24.100 --> 03:31.480
If a libero goes past the attack line to deliver an 
overhand set and someone spikes it, that is illegal.

03:32.650 --> 03:37.530
Their libero jumped just before the 
attack line to deliver a set in midair.

03:37.530 --> 03:39.660
That makes a valid spike.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.620
They can set up advanced attacks instantly.

03:42.950 --> 03:45.830
This is Aoba Jousai, the powerhouse!

03:46.790 --> 03:49.920
OlÃ©!

03:50.790 --> 03:51.290
All right!

03:51.290 --> 03:52.420
Daichi, nice receive!

03:52.420 --> 03:53.210
Asahi!

03:57.050 --> 03:58.220
The ball's coming back!

03:58.720 --> 03:59.890
<i>I have to push it over!</i>

04:04.810 --> 04:06.230
Take that!

04:09.150 --> 04:10.650
All right!

04:11.730 --> 04:13.570
<i>He was barely able to make that set.</i>

04:16.530 --> 04:18.400
Incredible.

04:21.990 --> 04:24.580
Okay, we're playing well!

04:24.580 --> 04:25.620
Stay calm!

04:25.620 --> 04:26.200
Yes, sir!

04:26.540 --> 04:30.000
They're starting to get used to our central attacks,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.130
so use the full width of the court as much as possible!

04:33.130 --> 04:34.130
Yes, sir!

04:34.750 --> 04:37.840
<i>How can there be no holes in Seijou's offense whatsoever?</i>

04:38.470 --> 04:43.050
<i>They alter any scenario to formulate a vicious attack,
 as if it was planned that way!</i>

04:44.220 --> 04:45.180
Let's go!

04:45.180 --> 04:46.310
Yessir!

04:46.310 --> 04:51.060
<i>We're definitely back on our feet after we briefly put Sugawara in the match.</i>

04:51.060 --> 04:53.650
<i>We've gotten rid of the unnecessary tension and pressure.</i>

04:54.190 --> 04:57.900
<i>I suspect that everyone on the team 
is now playing at their true potential.</i>

04:58.650 --> 05:04.410
<i>Is this the latent defect that truly sets the two teams apart?</i>

05:04.410 --> 05:06.330
Aoba Jousai               Karasuno

05:04.410 --> 05:06.330
Aoba Jousai               Karasuno

05:07.580 --> 05:09.040
Shit!

05:09.040 --> 05:10.670
Nice, Tsukishima!

05:10.670 --> 05:13.330
It's the dirty diversion that hits when they least expect it!

05:13.330 --> 05:14.250
Phrasing.

05:14.590 --> 05:20.260
I bet when they all put out 100%, the stronger team is Seijou.

05:20.970 --> 05:27.680
But isn't having that drop to 70% and rise again to 120%

05:28.140 --> 05:30.690
what a match is all about?

05:32.480 --> 05:37.610
And Karasuno has something that can increase its offensive power to 120%.

05:37.610 --> 05:39.490
The greatest decoy!

05:40.280 --> 05:43.160
<i>This is incredible! Seijou is incredible!</i>

05:43.160 --> 05:45.370
<i>I want to play, I want to play. I want to play now.</i>

05:45.370 --> 05:47.450
<i>I want to play now, now, now!</i>

05:47.450 --> 05:47.790
Hinata?

05:47.790 --> 05:48.910
Yes?

05:48.910 --> 05:51.660
Do you remember what Mr. Ukai just said?

05:51.660 --> 05:54.460
Attack using the full width of the court?

05:54.460 --> 05:57.420
Yes. And the attack that best utilizes it

05:58.170 --> 06:00.590
has barely been used in this match.

06:05.090 --> 06:06.760
Yes!

06:06.760 --> 06:08.560
<i>I don't like this.</i>

06:08.560 --> 06:12.060
{=1}Aoba Jousai               Karasuno

06:08.560 --> 06:12.060
{=0}Aoba Jousai               Karasuno

06:08.850 --> 06:12.060
<i>The team is keeping it together, but I can't help it.</i>

06:12.440 --> 06:16.400
<i>Whenever the tiny klutz walks on the court,</i>

06:17.060 --> 06:18.860
<i>it makes me incredibly nervous.</i>

06:20.070 --> 06:25.360
<i>He's the little beast who's been saving up all his frustration in the warmup zone.</i>

06:26.620 --> 06:31.040
<i>Karasuno has finally come together in the last set.</i>

06:27.240 --> 06:27.910
One point!

06:27.910 --> 06:29.200
Go, Shouyou!

06:29.200 --> 06:31.040
Go, go!

06:31.040 --> 06:34.000
<i>But we're still one step short of Seijou.</i>

06:34.500 --> 06:38.170
<i>If there's any possibility we can leave them a step behind,</i>

06:38.460 --> 06:39.670
<i>it's probably up to you guys.</i>

06:40.380 --> 06:43.090
<i>Put Karasuno that extra step ahead!</i>

06:45.430 --> 06:46.180
Nice receive!

06:46.180 --> 06:46.970
Left, left!

06:46.970 --> 06:47.600
Two blockers!

06:48.970 --> 06:50.560
Kageyama, nice job making contact!

06:51.020 --> 06:52.020
This is our chance!

06:53.180 --> 06:54.560
<i>Use the full width</i>

06:55.440 --> 06:56.770
<i>of the court!</i>

06:57.860 --> 07:00.400
<i>He's going for it! The air-splitting...</i>

07:02.820 --> 07:04.240
<i>Wide broad jump!</i>

07:07.030 --> 07:08.320
<b>Rule the Court</b>

07:07.030 --> 07:08.320
<b>Rule the Court</b>

07:15.830 --> 07:18.540
Nice spike, Hinata!

07:16.370 --> 07:18.540
Shouyou!

07:19.290 --> 07:20.250
<i>Oh no.</i>

07:21.210 --> 07:23.340
Yes!

07:21.800 --> 07:24.170
<i>Now that the duo is up and running,</i>

07:24.170 --> 07:27.050
<i>I can't allow them to stay on the court for any length of time.</i>

07:31.640 --> 07:32.520
Makki, nice!

07:32.520 --> 07:33.310
Yes!

07:33.310 --> 07:34.770
<i>Spin it around!</i>

07:34.770 --> 07:36.270
<i>Spin that rotation!</i>

07:36.980 --> 07:40.940
<i>Put the small fry in the back row as quickly as possible!</i>

07:42.530 --> 07:43.360
I've got it!

07:45.030 --> 07:48.490
The ball just won't hit the floor. Wow.

07:45.570 --> 07:47.110
Nice cover, Makki!

07:47.110 --> 07:48.110
It's coming back!

07:48.110 --> 07:49.070
We have a chance here!

07:51.280 --> 07:52.160
Again?!

07:52.620 --> 07:55.710
<i>Use the full width of the court!</i>

07:57.960 --> 08:00.420
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

07:57.960 --> 08:00.420
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

07:58.330 --> 07:59.920
All right!

08:01.630 --> 08:03.670
That small kid is amazing.

08:03.670 --> 08:09.840
Volleyball is a sport that involves jumping nonstop, so it's also like a fight against gravity.

08:10.140 --> 08:11.300
Jump to decoy.

08:11.640 --> 08:12.760
Jump to block.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.180
Jump to spike.

08:15.640 --> 08:16.600
Nishinoya, nice cover!

08:17.440 --> 08:19.190
As the rally continues,

08:19.600 --> 08:21.860
Back, go back! One more time!

08:20.940 --> 08:24.360
the more uncomfortable it gets, making it harder to think.

08:21.860 --> 08:23.190
Left, left!

08:23.190 --> 08:24.360
Let's stop it again!

08:24.360 --> 08:26.900
It makes you want to slack off on
 full-out blocks and decoy work so bad,

08:27.570 --> 08:30.990
once I even wished someone else would spike for me.

08:31.620 --> 08:36.160
As the long rally went on and on, 
I thought with my oxygen-deprived brain,

08:36.620 --> 08:40.960
"Would you just fall already, ball? 
Preferably on the opponent's side of the court?"

08:40.960 --> 08:44.040
Send it my way!

08:45.880 --> 08:49.760
<i>I can't drop my speed for a split-second, or I'll be put behind for good.</i>

08:50.090 --> 08:56.100
<i>With my height, if I don't jump as hard as I can, I'll be swatted down by the wall just like that!</i>

08:57.770 --> 08:59.480
<i>Run, run!</i>

08:59.480 --> 09:01.520
<i>Jump, jump!</i>

09:01.520 --> 09:03.060
<i>Do it to stay here!</i>

09:03.520 --> 09:07.940
I'm not gonna let you hit it unmarked!

09:09.070 --> 09:12.410
<i>Now! Use the full width of the court!</i>

09:13.320 --> 09:14.160
<i>Followed by...</i>

09:17.160 --> 09:18.870
<i>a breach through the center!</i>

09:22.880 --> 09:24.250
The pipe made it past!

09:24.250 --> 09:27.550
Nice spike!

09:25.880 --> 09:28.210
Hinata!

09:28.210 --> 09:29.510
Shit.

09:29.510 --> 09:30.670
I'm sorry.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.430
I totally fell for it.

09:33.550 --> 09:37.680
<i>In my head, I knew that the timing was right for a pipe.</i>

09:38.390 --> 09:43.060
<i>Yet I nearly gave it to Hinata!</i>

09:43.900 --> 09:47.070
<i>He nearly took the set away from me.</i>

09:44.230 --> 09:45.310
Gutsy move, Hinata!

09:45.310 --> 09:46.190
Thank you, sir!

09:48.360 --> 09:50.990
<i>The greatest decoy.</i>

09:51.780 --> 09:54.740
Aoba Jousai               Karasuno

09:51.780 --> 09:54.740
Aoba Jousai               Karasuno

09:52.200 --> 09:53.740
Karasuno caught up.

09:53.740 --> 09:54.740
They're tied.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.200
I'll hand out the towels.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.240
Thank you!

09:57.660 --> 09:58.700
Thanks.

10:04.500 --> 10:08.090
<i>The rallies are way longer than in the first and second sets.</i>

10:08.090 --> 10:09.630
<i>It's gotta be hard.</i>

10:10.460 --> 10:11.260
<i>But...</i>

10:13.880 --> 10:14.840
<i>I'm jealous.</i>

10:16.970 --> 10:19.810
What do we do about number ten's broad jump?

10:24.850 --> 10:26.310
The broad jump...

10:28.860 --> 10:30.230
has got to go.

10:32.150 --> 10:32.190
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

10:32.190 --> 10:32.240
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

10:49.710 --> 10:50.750
Tanaka, nice spike!

10:50.750 --> 10:51.800
Yes!

10:52.170 --> 10:55.010
<i>The next rotation puts Hinata in the back row.</i>

10:55.590 --> 10:57.800
Hey! How are you?!

10:57.800 --> 10:59.970
I-I'm fine!

11:00.720 --> 11:03.230
Rack up lots of points before you go back.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.350
No duh!

11:04.350 --> 11:05.900
Kunimi, nice receive!

11:05.900 --> 11:06.690
Kindaichi!

11:06.690 --> 11:07.810
Number twelve, number twelve!

11:08.940 --> 11:10.650
Nishinoya, nice receive!

11:10.650 --> 11:11.360
<i>Here's my chance!</i>

11:12.030 --> 11:14.070
Is he going for another broad jump?! Wait.

11:14.070 --> 11:14.740
What?

11:17.070 --> 11:18.370
He's unmarked!

11:18.370 --> 11:20.160
They stopped blocking!

11:20.160 --> 11:23.500
All right, hit it in unmarked, Hinata!

11:27.330 --> 11:28.000
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:29.670 --> 11:31.000
<i>I can see it perfectly!</i>

11:32.210 --> 11:33.760
Watari, nice receive!

11:33.760 --> 11:34.970
<i>He's deliberately unmarked!</i>

11:34.970 --> 11:36.680
<i>Barely any time passed!</i>

11:36.680 --> 11:39.300
<i>They change their strategy really fast!</i>

11:44.220 --> 11:45.940
Now a setter dump?!

11:46.390 --> 11:50.400
<i>They've used our momentary confusion to get a setter dump on us!</i>

11:51.270 --> 11:53.610
That broad jump has got to go.

11:53.610 --> 11:55.740
How do we do that, sir?

11:55.740 --> 11:59.070
The small fry's broad jump is probably another superhuman attack.

11:59.410 --> 12:03.080
It has terrific speed, but I suspect he gets caught up in the momentum,

12:03.080 --> 12:05.790
taking away his ability to be selective about its placement.

12:06.870 --> 12:07.580
Yes.

12:08.330 --> 12:11.710
We'll just have to dig out spikes from his broad jump instead of blocking them.

12:11.710 --> 12:12.710
Yes, sir!

12:12.710 --> 12:16.970
A block that doesn't work just interferes with the receive.

12:17.470 --> 12:22.640
No matter how hard it gets, never stop thinking or understanding one another!

12:22.640 --> 12:23.640
Nice receive!

12:24.140 --> 12:26.850
<i>Isn't his broad jump enough to disrupt Seijou?</i>

12:27.230 --> 12:28.140
<i>Shit.</i>

12:28.140 --> 12:30.560
<i>Just when we least wanted our opponent to get into a rhythm,</i>

12:30.850 --> 12:32.940
<i>it's his turn to serve.</i>

12:36.650 --> 12:37.780
Let's stop him here.

12:37.110 --> 12:39.700
OlÃ©!

12:37.780 --> 12:38.490
Yessir!

12:40.660 --> 12:41.820
What the...

12:43.330 --> 12:44.490
It went over the net!

12:43.330 --> 12:46.330
<b>Rule the Court</b>

12:43.330 --> 12:46.330
<b>Rule the Court</b>

12:44.490 --> 12:46.330
Talk about lucky!

12:46.830 --> 12:48.160
That was unavoidable!

12:48.160 --> 12:49.540
Just stay focused!

12:50.170 --> 12:52.290
<i>Shit, they have another two point buffer.</i>

12:52.290 --> 12:53.250
<i>Keep cool.</i>

12:53.250 --> 12:58.170
OlÃ©!

12:59.430 --> 13:01.090
Sorry! Cover me!

13:01.390 --> 13:02.300
I've got it!

13:01.390 --> 13:02.300
I've got it!

13:03.470 --> 13:04.470
Kageyama!

13:04.470 --> 13:05.760
Asahi, last hit!

13:06.270 --> 13:07.520
We have a chance here!

13:06.640 --> 13:08.100
That was close!

13:07.520 --> 13:08.100
Left!

13:08.100 --> 13:10.100
Calm down! Keep cool!

13:14.940 --> 13:17.900
Whoa, it's really hard to make it count!

13:18.240 --> 13:21.780
Taking control of a long rally is one way to gain momentum.

13:22.450 --> 13:25.160
The point earned from this rally will be huge!

13:27.950 --> 13:28.370
Cover it!

13:28.950 --> 13:32.250
<i>I'm not letting you have this point or the momentum!</i>

13:32.540 --> 13:33.670
Oh, it's still in play!

13:33.670 --> 13:35.210
But who will make the last hit?!

13:35.590 --> 13:37.420
Center!

13:37.760 --> 13:39.380
Shouyou, it's all yours!

13:40.130 --> 13:42.130
Get through!

13:42.130 --> 13:43.930
Stop him!

13:49.270 --> 13:50.680
All right!

13:50.680 --> 13:52.900
Aoba Jousai               Karasuno

13:50.680 --> 13:52.900
Aoba Jousai               Karasuno

13:54.440 --> 13:57.110
Now they've used up both timeouts.

13:57.110 --> 13:58.610
What else could they do?

13:59.070 --> 14:04.200
Unless they use a timeout to physically stop Seijou's momentum, they'll run away with the match.

14:04.950 --> 14:09.040
<i>Isn't there something, anything,
 that can change the momentum?</i>

14:09.040 --> 14:11.750
<i>We don't need big guns. I just want one play.</i>

14:11.750 --> 14:14.330
<i>Just one play to clear the air!</i>

14:24.340 --> 14:26.550
Seijou touched the net!

14:25.050 --> 14:26.100
I'm sorry!

14:26.100 --> 14:26.550
It's fine!

14:26.550 --> 14:28.060
Thank goodness.

14:28.060 --> 14:29.060
Still...

14:29.640 --> 14:33.690
<i>Now the small fry is in the back row!</i>

14:31.520 --> 14:32.480
It's up to you.

14:32.480 --> 14:33.140
Yes, sir.

14:33.980 --> 14:37.230
If we screw this up, Seijou will have twenty points!

14:34.190 --> 14:35.730
Hinata, relax!

14:35.730 --> 14:36.520
Yes, sir!

14:37.230 --> 14:40.440
And if they take the momentum 
along with it, we'll never catch up!

14:41.360 --> 14:43.200
Hey, Shimada. Look.

14:46.780 --> 14:51.160
T-Tadashi is their pinch server?!

14:53.040 --> 14:55.920
What is Keishin thinking? Is he dumb?!

14:55.920 --> 14:59.170
I told him that he only flukes them at best!

14:59.170 --> 15:02.130
It probably means he's hoping for a fluke.

15:02.840 --> 15:07.640
You never know what will change the momentum.

15:09.180 --> 15:11.060
Karasuno's pinch server?

15:11.060 --> 15:12.720
Is he good at serving?

15:12.720 --> 15:15.390
Or is it simply to clear the air?

15:15.390 --> 15:17.730
Either way, we aren't giving up the momentum.

15:19.310 --> 15:20.650
Yamaguchi, you can do this.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.150
But you won't beat me!

15:24.030 --> 15:26.950
<i>He hates being out of the match, even for a second.</i>

15:26.950 --> 15:28.120
Yamaguchi!

15:28.740 --> 15:29.950
Go change the momentum!

15:29.950 --> 15:31.330
Y-Yes, sir!

15:32.870 --> 15:33.830
<i>This line.</i>

15:35.540 --> 15:38.630
<i>A different world lies on the other side of it.</i>

15:43.960 --> 15:46.930
<i>I think the temperature is different on this side.</i>

15:50.930 --> 15:53.350
Way to score a huge promotion, Yamaguchi!

15:53.350 --> 15:54.180
Yes, sir!

15:54.180 --> 15:56.100
Take a shot at 'em, Yamaguchi!

15:56.100 --> 15:57.100
Give us a good serve.

15:57.100 --> 15:59.650
G-Give us a good one. T-Take it nice and easy now.

15:59.980 --> 16:02.860
Asahi, do you understand what nice and easy means?!

16:02.860 --> 16:06.320
<i>Yikes! Being put in the match now would freak out anyone!</i>

16:06.320 --> 16:09.360
<i>This is his first match and first serve in high school! It's terrifying!</i>

16:09.360 --> 16:10.950
<i>Is the coach a sadist or something?!</i>

16:10.950 --> 16:12.410
<i>It's even making me tense.</i>

16:12.410 --> 16:15.290
<i>Don't! Yamaguchi will pick up on it! Composure!</i>

16:15.290 --> 16:17.830
<i>I think the back of my head is safer without Hinata serving.</i>

16:18.170 --> 16:19.790
Is this safe?

16:19.790 --> 16:21.880
This situation is already tense enough.

16:21.880 --> 16:25.010
He's under enough pressure
 being put in ahead of his seniors.

16:25.010 --> 16:26.510
Oh, yeah!

16:27.300 --> 16:29.680
Hey, Yamaguchi!

16:31.050 --> 16:34.140
Serve up a nice one!

16:37.390 --> 16:39.350
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

16:37.390 --> 16:39.350
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

16:46.570 --> 16:48.740
Oh man. He's awkward as hell.

16:48.740 --> 16:50.240
Of course he is.

16:50.240 --> 16:54.740
Serving is the only time you're truly alone in a sport that involves passing the ball back and forth.

16:55.160 --> 16:57.040
Everyone's watching you.

16:57.040 --> 16:58.660
The pressure is intense.

16:59.670 --> 17:01.920
<i>This is scary, but...</i>

17:02.790 --> 17:08.670
The moment you stand in the position to serve, 
you're the star of the match, no matter who you are!

17:13.260 --> 17:16.970
<i>Prove to them that you can play too!</i>

17:20.850 --> 17:22.400
<i>A jump float serve?!</i>

17:24.270 --> 17:25.520
<i>Go over!</i>

17:36.370 --> 17:38.580
<b>Rule the Court</b>

17:36.370 --> 17:38.580
<b>Rule the Court</b>

17:38.580 --> 17:41.330
Aoba Jousai                   Karasuno

17:38.580 --> 17:41.330
Aoba Jousai                   Karasuno

17:39.000 --> 17:41.670
Work it, work it, Seijou! Work it, work it, Seijou!

17:41.670 --> 17:43.880
One more point!

17:42.540 --> 17:44.540
Okay, we got lucky.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.750
I-I'm sorry.

17:46.750 --> 17:47.800
Shake it off!

17:47.800 --> 17:49.130
D-Don't sweat it.

17:49.130 --> 17:50.260
Don't worry about it.

17:52.550 --> 17:53.930
I'm sorry.

17:53.930 --> 17:54.720
Nah.

17:54.720 --> 17:56.810
Just shake it off, Yamaguchi.

17:56.810 --> 17:58.680
Don't think twice about it. Leave it behind you.

18:00.060 --> 18:00.890
Yamaguchi!

18:02.020 --> 18:03.020
I-I'm sorry.

18:04.060 --> 18:05.810
Make the next one count.

18:08.900 --> 18:10.190
<i>The next one?</i>

18:10.900 --> 18:11.650
Yes, sir!

18:16.450 --> 18:18.790
<i>Has Karasuno's mood changed?</i>

18:19.160 --> 18:21.080
Captains are incredible.

18:21.080 --> 18:23.040
I still can't measure up to them.

18:23.420 --> 18:27.290
Wow. It's like I've been relieved of the worst stress of the day.

18:27.290 --> 18:28.630
Same here.

18:28.960 --> 18:33.430
What? They quickly brought him in and 
then threw him out again after he failed.

18:33.430 --> 18:35.090
I feel sorry for him.

18:35.590 --> 18:38.470
That's what pinch servers do.

18:38.470 --> 18:42.810
The momentum and their pride all rides on that one ball.

18:43.310 --> 18:45.940
And Tadashi failed.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.940
One point! One point!

18:46.560 --> 18:52.900
But this opportunity to learn frustration and his own powerlessness now will definitely make him better!

18:57.820 --> 18:59.160
All right!

18:58.200 --> 19:00.450
Has the guy with a tan perked up?

19:00.450 --> 19:02.830
Yeah, you might be right, Tattsuan.

19:03.750 --> 19:07.460
You never know what event might turn the tide.

19:08.250 --> 19:09.210
<i>Another match!</i>

19:09.840 --> 19:11.840
<i>Earn the chance to play...</i>

19:12.760 --> 19:13.720
<i>another match!</i>

19:14.130 --> 19:16.090
Daichi, nice receive!

19:14.550 --> 19:17.260
Okay, don't lose it now!

19:17.260 --> 19:21.810
<i>It's like the back of Seijou's shirt is within reach, 
yet it never gets any closer.</i>

19:21.810 --> 19:25.560
<i>Unless they score when Seijou is serving, Karasuno is just waiting to lose.</i>

19:28.400 --> 19:29.440
Cover it!

19:29.440 --> 19:32.110
<i>Is exhaustion gradually lowering their accuracy?</i>

19:32.530 --> 19:33.820
Kunimi!

19:35.030 --> 19:36.070
Nice cover!

19:35.030 --> 19:36.660
This is some high-level stuff.

19:36.660 --> 19:37.990
It's coming back! We have a chance!

19:36.660 --> 19:37.990
Is this really a third-round match?

19:41.620 --> 19:42.870
It's out.

19:42.870 --> 19:44.120
I'm sorry!

19:44.120 --> 19:46.330
Aoba Jousai               Karasuno

19:44.120 --> 19:46.330
Aoba Jousai               Karasuno

19:48.880 --> 19:49.500
Okay!

19:49.500 --> 19:51.840
Please score!

19:57.510 --> 19:58.720
It's out!

19:58.720 --> 19:59.510
Nice eye!

19:59.510 --> 20:01.220
Aoba Jousai               Karasuno

19:59.510 --> 20:01.220
Aoba Jousai               Karasuno

20:03.140 --> 20:04.020
Okay, good!

20:04.020 --> 20:04.810
Ryuu, last hit!

20:04.810 --> 20:06.600
Make it back-to-back points!

20:05.350 --> 20:06.600
Yeah!

20:10.730 --> 20:12.900
<i>Get every ball in front of me!</i>

20:14.030 --> 20:16.400
<i>He used his foot!</i>

20:21.950 --> 20:23.990
Right on!

20:22.620 --> 20:23.990
<i>That looks painful.</i>

20:24.580 --> 20:26.200
Nice, Hinata!

20:26.580 --> 20:28.920
We scored! Just one point behind now!

20:28.920 --> 20:31.130
Aoba Jousai               Karasuno

20:28.920 --> 20:31.130
Aoba Jousai               Karasuno

20:29.330 --> 20:31.130
Kageyama, give us a good serve!

20:31.750 --> 20:32.340
<i>One more point!</i>

20:40.090 --> 20:41.090
Daichi!

20:41.640 --> 20:43.470
<i>There's no way in hell I'll lose!</i>

20:43.850 --> 20:47.140
<i>There's no way in hell I'll lose!</i>

20:47.680 --> 20:48.350
<i>There's no way...</i>

20:51.400 --> 20:52.440
<i>Hey...</i>

20:53.820 --> 20:55.110
Yes!

20:55.110 --> 20:56.610
<i>They're the same!</i>

21:01.360 --> 21:03.240
Seijou now has...

21:03.330 --> 21:03.370
