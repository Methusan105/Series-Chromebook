Karasuno          Aoba Jousai

00:00.000 --> 00:03.980
Karasuno          Aoba Jousai

00:03.360 --> 00:06.610
Oh, you're back, Oikawa.

00:07.200 --> 00:08.570
How's your leg?

00:12.330 --> 00:13.620
A-okay.

00:13.620 --> 00:15.750
I can get back to regular practice.

00:15.750 --> 00:17.290
It was just a light sprain.

00:17.290 --> 00:20.290
Sheesh. You should be more careful.

00:20.290 --> 00:22.920
We demanded that they play Kageyama, you know.

00:22.920 --> 00:26.880
It'd be really cheap of us if we
 didn't play our own starting setter.

00:26.880 --> 00:28.010
I apologize.

00:28.010 --> 00:31.550
Don't push yourself, Oikawa!

00:32.300 --> 00:33.470
Oikawa!

00:33.470 --> 00:36.720
Say, Kageyama. Who's the pretty boy?

00:36.720 --> 00:38.430
He's really getting on my nerves.

00:39.020 --> 00:40.940
That's Seijou's captain.

00:42.060 --> 00:43.270
Oikawa.

00:43.610 --> 00:47.990
He's a really aggressive setter, and I'm sure he's one of the best attackers on the team on top of that.

00:48.780 --> 00:51.360
<i>I can't believe Kageyama's speaking so highly of a player.</i>

00:53.120 --> 00:55.080
Also, he's a total jerk.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.410
That's scary, coming from you!

00:56.830 --> 00:58.250
Might even be worse than Tsukishima.

00:58.250 --> 01:00.120
Sounds horrible.

01:00.670 --> 01:04.000
You know the guy?
 Does that mean he's from Kitagawa First?

01:04.000 --> 01:04.460
Yeah.

01:05.210 --> 01:07.090
He was my upperclassman in junior high.

01:07.090 --> 01:09.380
<i>The king's upperclassman?</i>

01:09.970 --> 01:11.300
<i>Does that make him a great king?</i>

01:12.930 --> 01:14.010
Hey there.

01:14.010 --> 01:16.100
Long time no see, Tobio.

01:16.970 --> 01:16.970
{OP}

01:21.600 --> 01:23.810
The heat flickers

01:23.810 --> 01:26.150
Sweat glitters on my skin

01:26.150 --> 01:31.030
Shouts echo and shoulders hit

01:31.030 --> 01:35.700
We asked the sky through the open window

01:31.150 --> 01:37.200

01:32.030 --> 01:37.200

01:39.580 --> 01:41.790
Tell me, Mr. Future

01:41.790 --> 01:43.540
Come on, come on, come on

01:43.540 --> 01:46.130
The chance is there

01:46.540 --> 01:48.130
Come on, come on, come on

01:48.130 --> 01:50.300
Do it together

01:52.220 --> 01:56.800
Everybody always wants to stand there,

01:56.800 --> 02:01.520
make mistakes, get angry, and struggle

02:01.520 --> 02:02.850
We'll never give up

02:02.850 --> 02:06.310
We don't want it to end

02:06.310 --> 02:11.820
I will continue on with my imagination

02:13.320 --> 02:18.030
I want to struggle and fall and become stronger

02:18.030 --> 02:22.790
I want to persevere, stand back up, do it again,

02:22.790 --> 02:24.080
and never give up

02:24.080 --> 02:27.380
Let me run

02:27.380 --> 02:33.220
I will run to where my imagination leads me

02:47.020 --> 02:47.020
{Part A}

02:47.860 --> 02:50.320
Long time no see, Tobio.

02:49.520 --> 02:53.530
Episode Seven:
Versus the Great King

02:49.520 --> 02:53.530
Episode Seven:
Versus the Great King

02:50.320 --> 02:51.480
It's been forever.

02:51.480 --> 02:53.820
How's ruling your kingdom coming along?

02:53.820 --> 02:58.200
I learned how to serve and block by watching him play.

02:58.910 --> 03:00.700
He's seriously good.

03:00.700 --> 03:02.660
<i>That's who he got the killer serve from?</i>

03:02.910 --> 03:05.670
But stay focused on the match.

03:05.670 --> 03:07.290
We've gotta win this last set.

03:07.290 --> 03:08.170
G-Got it.

03:08.630 --> 03:10.170
Quit trying to scare him, Tanaka!

03:10.920 --> 03:13.130
Anyway, go warm up.

03:13.130 --> 03:15.050
And be more thorough than usual.

03:15.050 --> 03:16.050
Yes, sir.

03:18.550 --> 03:20.970
I seriously wanna kill him!

03:20.970 --> 03:23.430
Aoba Jousai          Karasuno

03:20.970 --> 03:23.430
Aoba Jousai          Karasuno

03:22.720 --> 03:26.100
Hey, why isn't Oikawa playing yet?

03:26.100 --> 03:29.900
Don't be silly. He has to warm up first,
 or else he could get hurt.

03:27.480 --> 03:28.940
All right!

03:29.900 --> 03:33.780
No! Anything but that!

03:33.780 --> 03:34.860
Right?

03:34.860 --> 03:36.780
Take this!

03:40.530 --> 03:43.040
Aoba Jousai          Karasuno

03:40.530 --> 03:43.040
Aoba Jousai          Karasuno

03:43.580 --> 03:44.750
<i>One more point.</i>

03:45.330 --> 03:46.460
<i>One more point...</i>

03:47.080 --> 03:49.920
<i>...and we'll beat Seijou, one of the top four teams in the prefecture.</i>

03:50.710 --> 03:53.000
Don't get full of yourselves, damn it!

03:54.340 --> 03:55.510
Good one, Kindaichi!

03:55.510 --> 03:57.050
Don't worry, Tsukishima.

03:59.260 --> 04:00.260
My oh my.

04:00.260 --> 04:02.560
Looks like we're down to the wire.

04:02.560 --> 04:03.470
How'd your warm up go?

04:04.470 --> 04:05.850
A-okay!

04:08.640 --> 04:10.480
I'll take care of the rest.

04:10.480 --> 04:11.310
Please.

04:12.440 --> 04:14.230
<i>The great king enters the fray!</i>

04:14.230 --> 04:15.110
Cut that out.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.410
Are we switching setters?

04:20.410 --> 04:23.990
No, I think he's just pinch-serving.

04:22.660 --> 04:23.990
Give us a good serve, Oikawa!

04:25.500 --> 04:28.210
You could have all the offensive power in the world,

04:28.960 --> 04:32.250
but it wouldn't mean a thing if you never got to attack.

04:35.590 --> 04:36.670
<i>What?</i>

04:44.970 --> 04:45.930
<i>He's aiming for Tsukishima?</i>

04:48.430 --> 04:49.770
<i>Tsukki!</i>

04:52.310 --> 04:53.860
Yep. I knew it.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.320
I watched some of the match.

04:55.320 --> 04:56.980
You, number six,

04:56.980 --> 04:58.360
and you, number five...

04:59.610 --> 05:02.160
You suck at receiving, don't you? First-years, I take it?

05:04.200 --> 05:08.160
<i>His serve is as powerful as Kageyama'sâ€”
no, maybe even more.</i>

05:08.160 --> 05:10.580
And <i>he's got the control to direct it wherever he wants.</i>

05:11.120 --> 05:13.330
<i>This is Seijou's captain.</i>

05:13.330 --> 05:15.290
Another one coming right up.

05:20.840 --> 05:22.300
Tsukki!

05:22.300 --> 05:23.180
All right!

05:23.180 --> 05:23.800
Shit.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.260
Don't worry about it, Tsukishima!

05:27.270 --> 05:30.350
<i>I hate Tsukishima because he's always such a jerk.</i>

05:30.350 --> 05:32.440
<i>But, you know...</i>

05:32.440 --> 05:35.400
Aoba Jousai          Karasuno

05:32.440 --> 05:35.400
Aoba Jousai          Karasuno

05:32.810 --> 05:35.400
Oh, we'll be tied if we score another point.

05:35.820 --> 05:37.860
Hey, you! Great king!

05:37.860 --> 05:39.650
Hit it over here! I'll dig it out!

05:39.650 --> 05:42.320
Bring it on! Don't you look down on us!

05:40.990 --> 05:42.320
<i>Great king?</i>

05:42.820 --> 05:44.570
Quit whining. It's pathetic.

05:44.570 --> 05:45.580
What was that?!

05:46.030 --> 05:49.200
<i>Amazing how he can still be an ass when we're this close to losing.</i>

05:49.200 --> 05:51.080
<i>Even so...</i>

05:51.960 --> 05:52.830
Listen up.

05:52.830 --> 05:54.580
In volleyball,

05:55.380 --> 05:58.800
everyone on your side of the court is your ally, without exception!

06:00.010 --> 06:01.760
Such wise words!

06:02.220 --> 06:03.090
Okay.

06:03.090 --> 06:04.800
Get back, all of you.

06:04.800 --> 06:07.140
And Tsukishima, get closer to the sideline.

06:07.140 --> 06:07.810
Okay.

06:08.760 --> 06:09.390
All right.

06:09.680 --> 06:10.390

06:12.810 --> 06:16.730
So the captain, a skilled receiver, 
is gonna cover more area himself.

06:17.520 --> 06:21.400
But, you know, you can't cover the entire court by yourself!

06:22.360 --> 06:24.450
Tsukki!

06:22.990 --> 06:25.570
He aimed for him even though 
he's standing at the very edge?!

06:25.570 --> 06:28.870
But because he needed precise control, 
this one's weaker than the previous two!

06:30.240 --> 06:31.160
It's up!

06:31.160 --> 06:32.460
Nice, Tsukki!

06:32.750 --> 06:34.750
Wow, he received it. Atta boy.

06:34.750 --> 06:36.580
Maybe I made it a bit too easy for him.

06:36.580 --> 06:39.880
But this is our chance to score.

06:40.210 --> 06:41.130
Damn it.

06:41.510 --> 06:44.430
A golden opportunity.

06:44.430 --> 06:46.300
Put it away, guys.

06:46.760 --> 06:47.260
I got this!

06:47.260 --> 06:50.930
<i>This is bad. Our current rotation is the one with the shortest blockers.</i>

06:52.640 --> 06:53.560
Kindaichi!

06:53.560 --> 06:55.600
<i>Good. I shook off the blockersâ€”</i>

06:57.060 --> 06:59.610
<i>What's that midget doing here?!</i>

07:00.480 --> 07:01.190
It went up.

07:01.190 --> 07:02.150
Good job making contact!

07:02.150 --> 07:03.190
Now's our chance!

07:03.190 --> 07:04.070
Why, you little...

07:04.070 --> 07:05.910
Now I'm gonna swat you away!

07:09.080 --> 07:10.530
<i>A step, a second...</i>

07:10.530 --> 07:13.950
<i>Once this guy steals the march on you, you can never catch up to him.</i>

07:14.290 --> 07:15.500
<i>The only thing that can...</i>

07:16.420 --> 07:17.540
<i>is the ball!</i>

07:40.310 --> 07:42.780
Aoba Jousai          Karasuno

07:40.310 --> 07:42.780
Aoba Jousai          Karasuno

07:43.070 --> 07:44.190
What just happened?

07:44.190 --> 07:46.610
He went from one side of the court to the other in a flash.

07:46.610 --> 07:49.240
That set looked like it got sucked into the spiker's hand.

07:51.700 --> 07:53.410
Hell yeah!

07:54.290 --> 07:55.200
Line up!

07:57.790 --> 07:59.170
What's wrong?

07:59.170 --> 08:00.580
That was incredible!

08:00.580 --> 08:02.040
Oh, right.

08:02.040 --> 08:06.050
Today's your first time seeing Hinata and Kageyama's quick attacks in action.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.010
Amazing, right?

08:07.010 --> 08:09.260
Actually, I don't know if I should call it amazing or scary.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.930
Please give us your thoughts!

08:12.600 --> 08:14.470
Something like a critique, sir.

08:14.470 --> 08:15.810
O-Oh, right.

08:16.310 --> 08:21.440
I still don't know much about volleyball,

08:21.440 --> 08:22.270
but...

08:23.150 --> 08:26.280
even I could tell something incredible was going on here.

08:29.360 --> 08:33.580
A new school year began, some great first-years joined us,

08:33.580 --> 08:36.000
and things didn't go too well at first,

08:36.000 --> 08:39.460
but I think I realized something today.

08:39.460 --> 08:41.290
Alone, they might be nothing special,

08:41.830 --> 08:46.510
but when certain people come together, they form something far greater than the sum of their parts.

08:47.300 --> 08:52.430
Even as we speak, there might be encounters taking place that could change the world.

08:52.430 --> 08:56.850
It could be anywhereâ€”like in a faraway country,

08:56.850 --> 08:58.640
or maybe on the other side of the Earth.

08:59.390 --> 09:04.730
Or they could be taking place in the remote 
countryside of a tiny island country in the Far Eastâ€”

09:04.730 --> 09:09.320
in the perfectly average volleyball team of a perfectly normal high school.

09:09.860 --> 09:14.120
Watching the match, I felt like something like that had happened at Karasuno.

09:15.160 --> 09:18.500
I have nothing to back this belief up, 
but I still think it's much better than not believing.

09:19.210 --> 09:24.250
I'm sure you guys will grow much, much stronger.

09:29.220 --> 09:32.260
Sorry! Was that too flowery?! Did you get weirded out?!

09:32.260 --> 09:34.140
N-No! Of course not!

09:34.640 --> 09:36.600
Thank you.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.270
S-Sure.

09:43.400 --> 09:44.360
Kindaichi.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.830
We've had it with that guy!

09:57.580 --> 10:00.040
No matter how good an offensive weapon he is,

10:00.040 --> 10:02.330
he's clearly hurting the team!

10:03.620 --> 10:04.500
Frankly,

10:05.500 --> 10:06.920
we'd be much better off without him.

10:13.050 --> 10:14.510
Don't you dare apologize!

10:16.640 --> 10:17.930
I'm not gonna apologize either!

10:19.140 --> 10:20.350
'Kay.

10:20.350 --> 10:23.810
To me, you're still gonna be an oppressive king,

10:23.810 --> 10:27.310
a jerk, and the guy I wanna destroy most of all!

10:28.400 --> 10:29.230
'Kay.

10:29.650 --> 10:30.900
So don't you dare apologize!

10:30.900 --> 10:31.740
'Kay.

10:31.740 --> 10:33.280
I'm not gonna make up with you.

10:33.280 --> 10:35.240
Not like we used to be friends, anyway.

10:35.240 --> 10:35.910
'Kay.

10:37.120 --> 10:38.830
And next time,

10:39.240 --> 10:40.580
we'll win for sure!

10:46.330 --> 10:46.880
Next time...

10:46.880 --> 10:50.090
Toilet, toilet!

10:50.090 --> 10:51.760
Who am I?

10:51.760 --> 10:54.300
A future ace, that's who!

10:55.720 --> 10:59.560
<i>Shit, this is one of those situations. You know, bad blood and all that.</i>

10:59.560 --> 11:01.520
<i>Something tells me I shouldn't get involved.</i>

11:01.520 --> 11:02.640
Kindaichi.

11:03.430 --> 11:06.100
We'll be the ones to win next time too.

11:14.110 --> 11:15.360
What were you two talking about?

11:16.110 --> 11:19.240
He just said "we."

11:20.120 --> 11:21.370
Are those tears I see?

11:21.370 --> 11:26.250
The same guy who used to go "I, my, me" 
all the time, like he was fighting a lone battle.

11:21.370 --> 11:24.250
Hell no! Just go use the toilet already!

11:24.250 --> 11:26.250
Don't try to change the topic, bro.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.170
Screw you, Hinata!

11:29.170 --> 11:29.960
Shit.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.210
This is hard to take.

11:36.470 --> 11:37.680
What was that for?

11:39.090 --> 11:41.640
Thank you very much!

11:43.600 --> 11:45.600
Mr. Takeda sang our praises,

11:46.140 --> 11:50.810
but honestly speaking, we still desperately lack something required to take Seijou on

11:50.810 --> 11:53.530
and beat them with Oikawa playing the whole match.

11:54.490 --> 11:56.240
Now that's a captain for you.

11:57.740 --> 11:59.910
He knows what he's talking about.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.830
The great king showed up!

12:04.160 --> 12:05.370
Got a problem?

12:05.370 --> 12:06.210
What do you want?

12:06.210 --> 12:08.330
You wanna go?

12:09.120 --> 12:11.540
No need to be so hostile.

12:12.090 --> 12:13.170
You, the little one.

12:13.960 --> 12:17.090
That play you pulled off at the end with the block and the broad jump was incredible.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.470
Next time, let's go all out right from the start.

12:23.560 --> 12:25.930
I didn't get to show you how I set, after all.

12:26.430 --> 12:27.560
Oh, right.

12:27.560 --> 12:30.400
I'll make sure to improve my serve too.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.610
<i>Oh yeah.</i>

12:33.440 --> 12:36.530
<i>Normally, that serve would be unleashed right from the start.</i>

12:38.490 --> 12:41.370
Your offense certainly is great,

12:41.370 --> 12:44.950
but if you guys don't get better at receiving, you'll soon hit the glass ceiling.

12:45.830 --> 12:49.670
I'm not the only one who's got a powerful serve, you know.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.210
The interhigh prelims are coming up soon.

12:52.210 --> 12:53.750
Don't get knocked out.

12:55.050 --> 13:03.550
Because I want to take this oh-so-precious junior of mine on, setter-on-setter, in an official match and destroy him!

13:04.680 --> 13:06.310
We'll train extra-hard to receive!

13:06.310 --> 13:07.270
Hey, let me go.

13:07.850 --> 13:11.270
You don't get better at receiving overnight.

13:12.480 --> 13:15.190
Though I suppose your captain knows that already.

13:15.820 --> 13:17.940
You don't have much time left.

13:17.940 --> 13:20.200
I look forward to seeing what you come up with.

13:21.860 --> 13:23.870
D-Don't let him get to you.

13:23.870 --> 13:27.490
He just likes to mess with people, is all.

13:30.620 --> 13:33.880
Sure, there's not much time left until the interhigh prelims,

13:33.880 --> 13:36.590
but he'll be back soon.

13:37.590 --> 13:39.090
Who?

13:40.470 --> 13:43.010
Karasuno's guardian angel!

13:43.930 --> 13:46.970
<i>Karasuno's guardian angel?</i>

13:48.100 --> 13:48.140
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

13:48.140 --> 13:48.180
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

13:48.180 --> 13:48.220
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

13:48.180 --> 13:48.220

13:48.270 --> 13:48.310
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

13:48.270 --> 13:48.310
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

13:48.310 --> 13:55.020
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

13:48.310 --> 13:55.020
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

13:55.020 --> 13:55.020

13:55.150 --> 13:55.190

13:55.190 --> 13:55.230
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

13:55.230 --> 13:55.270

13:55.230 --> 13:55.270

13:55.270 --> 13:55.310

13:55.270 --> 13:55.310

13:55.310 --> 13:55.360

13:55.310 --> 13:55.360

13:55.360 --> 14:02.030
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

13:55.360 --> 14:02.030
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

14:03.240 --> 14:05.740
Kageyama showed quite the transformation, didn't he?

14:06.080 --> 14:06.910
Totally.

14:06.910 --> 14:11.250
Now that the prodigy who was spinning his wheels has found the perfect outlet for his talents,

14:11.250 --> 14:13.830
plebeians are no match for him.

14:14.540 --> 14:16.340
Does that include you?

14:16.340 --> 14:17.670
At setting, yeah.

14:17.670 --> 14:21.380
I don't think there's a single setter in this prefecture who can distribute the ball as well as he does.

14:21.380 --> 14:24.800
He's not as good as me at serving, blocking, or spiking, though.

14:26.140 --> 14:29.100
Damn it, Oikawa! Don't just admit his sets are better than yours!

14:29.100 --> 14:30.680
And you call yourself a setter?

14:30.680 --> 14:32.680
But it's true!

14:33.020 --> 14:36.150
That's exactly why we need to break their defense down.

14:36.150 --> 14:41.240
It doesn't matter how good their setter is if they don't get him the ball.

14:41.240 --> 14:43.900
I hope we get to play Karasuno in an official match.

14:43.900 --> 14:48.330
I wanna throw their defense for a loop, give them no chances to make any sets, and then smugly say to them,

14:48.330 --> 14:51.750
"Having a star on your team doesn't mean you'll win. But don't worry about it!"

14:51.750 --> 14:53.330
I wanna say it so bad!

14:53.910 --> 14:56.750
What? Don't prodigies piss you off?

14:56.750 --> 15:00.170
Guys who girls fawn over piss me off even more!

15:00.170 --> 15:01.260
Ow!

15:01.260 --> 15:03.380
Jealous much, Iwa? That's pathetic!

15:03.380 --> 15:04.170
Oww!

15:03.380 --> 15:06.720
Quit messing around or the Coach will get mad at you.

15:04.170 --> 15:06.720
That hurts, Iwa!

15:08.300 --> 15:11.430
Let's clean up the place a little, and that'll be that.

15:11.430 --> 15:12.430
Well done, boys!

15:12.430 --> 15:14.270
Thank you!

15:14.270 --> 15:14.890
Hey!

15:15.520 --> 15:17.690
Thanks for today, sir.

15:17.690 --> 15:19.860
Don't mention it. You all did great today.

15:19.860 --> 15:24.360
I was amazed you actually went and beat <i>the</i> Aoba Jousai!

15:24.360 --> 15:26.490
But we're not quite there yet.

15:27.200 --> 15:32.200
We're somehow scoring points 
thanks to Hinata and Kageyama,

15:32.540 --> 15:34.710
but if Hinata were to be caught by the blockers

15:33.410 --> 15:35.710
Forget about mopping, Hinata. Go home.

15:34.710 --> 15:37.670
or our defense broken down like today,

15:36.540 --> 15:37.670
Look at that, Tsukki.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.170
we'd be in deep trouble.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.170
Oh wow.

15:39.750 --> 15:42.460
And if we were to find ourselves in such a situation,

15:42.460 --> 15:46.590
I'm not sure I'd be able to lead the team like a coach would.

15:46.590 --> 15:48.260
Right.

15:48.260 --> 15:49.470
I'm sorry!

15:49.470 --> 15:51.850
I don't mean to say you're not good enough!

15:52.510 --> 15:53.970
I know.

15:53.970 --> 15:56.390
Don't worry. I'll get you a coach.

15:56.390 --> 15:57.350
I know where to go.

15:57.350 --> 15:58.940
Really?

15:58.940 --> 15:59.650
Who is it?

15:59.650 --> 16:04.110
Foot of the Slope

15:59.980 --> 16:04.110
I've asked plenty of times before, 
and I've yet to get a positive reply,

16:04.610 --> 16:06.450
but I'll make it happen somehow.

16:07.860 --> 16:09.990
Could you take care of the rest for today?

16:09.990 --> 16:11.030
Yes, sir.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.910
F-For some reason, Take seems really reliable right now.

16:14.910 --> 16:15.790
Yeah.

16:15.790 --> 16:18.080
Equipment Room

16:15.790 --> 16:18.080
Equipment Room

16:15.790 --> 16:18.080
m 846 373.5 l 844.5 460.5 1159.5 490.5 1161 406.5

16:18.920 --> 16:20.000
What the heck?

16:20.000 --> 16:23.090
This mop doesn't look safe. Can I throw it away?

16:23.090 --> 16:25.800
Oh, don't worry. It's fine.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.220
We can still use it if we get it fixed.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.020
Dismissed!

16:36.020 --> 16:37.140
Thank you!

16:37.980 --> 16:39.940
<b>Foot of the Slope</b>

16:38.770 --> 16:39.940
Chinese buns?

16:40.480 --> 16:43.190
The soccer team just bought the last ones.

16:43.190 --> 16:45.150
We're sold out for the day.

16:45.150 --> 16:46.860
But I'm starving!

16:46.860 --> 16:48.450
Do your job, lazybones!

16:48.450 --> 16:49.360
Shaddup!

16:49.360 --> 16:52.030
Go home and eat a proper meal already!

16:52.030 --> 16:53.580
You won't build any muscle otherwise!

16:55.580 --> 16:56.370
Catch.

17:00.790 --> 17:02.210
Thank you!

17:02.210 --> 17:03.880
Make sure to eat dinner.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.090
Coming.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.800
Hello, this is Foot of the Slope.

17:14.930 --> 17:16.520
Not you again.

17:18.180 --> 17:19.600
All said and done,

17:20.060 --> 17:22.560
that pretty boy had an amazing serve.

17:22.560 --> 17:25.360
We would've been in deep shit if we had to deal with that the entire match.

17:25.360 --> 17:28.070
I guess we should've expected as much from Kageyama's upperclassman...

17:28.530 --> 17:33.240
Wait, why'd you even join Karasuno?

17:34.870 --> 17:38.620
The strongest school in this prefecture is Shiratorizawa.

17:38.620 --> 17:39.620
Shiratori?

17:39.620 --> 17:42.540
Shiratorizawa. By far the best team in the prefecture,

17:42.540 --> 17:46.340
and a powerhouse that's among the top eight in the country.

17:46.340 --> 17:47.210
Wow.

17:48.550 --> 17:50.170
I didn't get into Shiratorizawa.

17:50.470 --> 17:51.170
You what?!

17:51.800 --> 17:55.760
They didn't give me a recommendation, 
so I took the general entrance exam and failed.

17:55.760 --> 17:57.510
It was Greek and Hebrew to me.

17:57.510 --> 18:01.270
Yeah, I hear it's really hard to get in the normal way.

18:01.270 --> 18:05.610
Oh, so the king isn't very good at studies.

18:04.350 --> 18:05.610
See you tomorrow.

18:05.940 --> 18:07.730
Why Karasuno, then?

18:07.730 --> 18:10.570
Did you wanna be like the Little Giant too?

18:11.110 --> 18:14.910
Because I heard Coach Ukai was coming out of retirement.

18:14.910 --> 18:15.910
Ukai?

18:16.580 --> 18:21.290
The miracle worker who led no-name Karasuno to the spring nationals!

18:22.410 --> 18:26.040
"Karasuno's Ukai" became famous all across the nation.

18:26.040 --> 18:28.630
They called him a coach who led a group of violent crows.

18:28.630 --> 18:32.300
He coached the current upperclassmen a little last year.

18:32.300 --> 18:33.840
He was a real hardass.

18:35.590 --> 18:37.720
Why do you look envious?

18:38.310 --> 18:41.680
Coach Ukai was officially gonna 
come out of retirement, but then...

18:41.680 --> 18:42.980
He got hospitalized?!

18:42.980 --> 18:45.690
He doesn't plan on coming back anytime soon. Sorry.

18:46.690 --> 18:49.440
It doesn't really matter what school I'm in, though.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.610
I'll be facing high schoolers just like me.

18:51.610 --> 18:53.150
There's no reason why I can't win.

18:53.530 --> 18:55.160
Don't be a sore loser now.

18:55.160 --> 18:57.120
Acting cool isn't gonna help.

18:57.120 --> 19:00.160
You're wrong! And I'm not trying to act cool!

19:00.160 --> 19:03.160
We <i>did</i> actually beat a top four team today, didn't we?

19:03.160 --> 19:04.120
Well, yeah.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.250
We beat Seijou 2-1.

19:06.250 --> 19:09.670
And I was able to score freely. Guess we have Hinata to thank for being such a great decoy.

19:09.670 --> 19:10.840
Th-Thanks!

19:11.340 --> 19:14.380
Anyway, how did <i>you</i> like your debut?

19:27.020 --> 19:30.360
Though, well, you did screw up spectacularly in the first set.

19:30.360 --> 19:34.240
You conceded as many points as you scored, so you'd better not be satisfied with it.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.280
Why do you have to say things like that?!

19:36.860 --> 19:37.990
That's right.

19:38.450 --> 19:42.700
We're lacking in a lot of ways, 
and we only barely managed to win today.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.960
I-I'll train a bunch!

19:44.960 --> 19:46.080
O-Okay.

19:46.080 --> 19:47.920
Individual improvements are important too.

19:47.920 --> 19:52.300
But right now, Karasuno's badly short on hands.

19:53.090 --> 19:54.130
Yeah.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.180
We need a defensive cornerstoneâ€”a libero,

19:57.180 --> 20:01.850
and an ace spiker who can take on three blockers by himself.

20:02.260 --> 20:04.100
I call that!

20:04.100 --> 20:06.770
I told you already! You're the greatest decoy!

20:09.350 --> 20:12.520
But didn't you say our "guardian angel"
would be back soon?

20:12.520 --> 20:13.280
Yeah.

20:13.280 --> 20:16.280
We're no powerhouse, but we're not all that weak either.

20:16.820 --> 20:19.870
This team's had some talented players during my time here,

20:19.870 --> 20:22.330
but we never managed to put their strengths together.

20:24.040 --> 20:25.620
But if all of us come together again,

20:26.120 --> 20:29.250
add you first-years to the equation,

20:29.250 --> 20:32.380
and put everything we have together...

20:33.340 --> 20:34.670
...then the summer interhighâ€”

20:35.420 --> 20:36.880
taking the national throneâ€”

20:36.880 --> 20:39.010
won't just be some faraway goal.

20:39.010 --> 20:41.930
I'm certain that it'll be within our reach!

20:42.470 --> 20:44.970
I've heard about the summer interhigh!

20:44.970 --> 20:48.140
But this guy you say is coming back...

20:48.140 --> 20:49.600
Where has he been all this while?

20:52.520 --> 20:56.570
He was suspended for a week and banned from club activities for about a month.

20:57.610 --> 20:59.450
Is he a delinquent?

20:59.450 --> 21:00.320
Hell no!

21:00.700 --> 21:03.780
He's just... a little too passionate, is all.

21:03.780 --> 21:05.290
He's a seriously nice guy.

21:05.290 --> 21:08.710
<i>I can't believe Tanaka of all people is 
calling someone else "too passionate."</i>

21:08.710 --> 21:10.210
That's not all.

21:10.620 --> 21:13.380
He's Karasuno's one and only prodigy.

21:14.040 --> 21:19.380
Though I guess he's not the "one and only" anymore, now that we have the super-cocky Kageyama too.

21:21.090 --> 21:24.970
Call him "sir" when he comes back, Hinata.

21:24.970 --> 21:27.810
You'll make him stupidly happy, just like Tanaka.

21:27.810 --> 21:28.890
"Stupidly"?

21:31.390 --> 21:33.230
<i>Guardian angel, huh?</i>

21:33.230 --> 21:34.900
<i>I wonder what he's like.</i>

21:34.900 --> 21:35.860
We're gonna leave you behind!

21:35.860 --> 21:37.440
Coming!

21:53.710 --> 21:54.250
<i>It's gonna hit!</i>

22:00.550 --> 22:03.130
Don't get in my way, Hinatard!

22:03.130 --> 22:04.930
That could've hit the target, you know!

22:04.930 --> 22:06.430
Did I get it? Did I dig it out?

22:06.430 --> 22:09.100
Hell no, jackass! You knocked it out of the park!

22:09.100 --> 22:09.890
I'll go get it back.

22:09.890 --> 22:10.890
Idiot.

22:16.270 --> 22:17.730
<i>I got it this time.</i>

22:28.660 --> 22:31.410
<i>He killed all the speed and spin,</i>

22:31.410 --> 22:33.580
<i>and returned the ball to where the setter would be.</i>

22:34.040 --> 22:35.630
<i>That was a perfect receive.</i>

22:37.920 --> 22:40.840
Y-You're shorter than me?

22:42.010 --> 22:42.010
{ED}

22:52.640 --> 22:56.560
If I tell you this story,

22:56.560 --> 23:00.320
I wonder if I can explain to you

23:00.820 --> 23:04.780
my feelings

23:04.780 --> 23:07.780
and the distance between us

23:08.490 --> 23:16.460
Standing on an empty field

23:16.790 --> 23:25.380
I breathe out into the night air

23:25.380 --> 23:29.930
Countless times I swore that I would change

23:29.930 --> 23:33.930
I stumbled and fell a lot,

23:33.930 --> 23:37.900
but I swore I would laugh at the end

23:37.900 --> 23:41.820
and not let my tears go to waste

23:41.820 --> 23:45.820
There are so many dreams that can definitely come true

23:45.820 --> 23:49.820
I always sat somewhere, downcast, dejected, depressed,

23:49.820 --> 23:52.370
but still I decided I would fight,

23:52.370 --> 23:57.370
and not let all my frustration go to waste

23:57.370 --> 24:01.710
This is our revenge

24:17.020 --> 24:19.150
<i>And then he received like "bam" and sent it back like "whoosh."</i>

24:19.150 --> 24:20.440
<i>Now I'm all like "whoa."</i>

24:20.440 --> 24:23.070
