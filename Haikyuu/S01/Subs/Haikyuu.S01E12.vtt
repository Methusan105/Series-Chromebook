00:06.570 --> 00:08.860
This year, I'll see you at nationals.

00:09.200 --> 00:12.080
Heh! You say the same thing every year.

00:12.620 --> 00:13.620
Shaddup!

00:13.620 --> 00:15.040
This is gonna be the year.

00:15.370 --> 00:21.460
We're looking forward to the Battle of the Garbage Dumpster at nationals this year!

00:21.460 --> 00:27.010
<i>But at the June interhigh, both schools
 narrowly miss earning a ticket to nationals.</i>

00:28.630 --> 00:33.140
<i>In March of the next year, Karasuno High, representing Miyagi prefecture,</i>

00:33.140 --> 00:36.220
<i>and Nekoma High, as Tokyo's second representative,</i>

00:36.850 --> 00:39.770
<i>both appeared in the Spring High School
 National Volleyball Tournament, however...</i>

00:40.850 --> 00:45.570
<i>Karasuno was defeated in the third round,
 and Nekoma was eliminated in the quarterfinals.</i>

00:46.230 --> 00:48.860
<i>They held many, many practice matches,</i>

00:48.860 --> 00:55.120
<i>but both coaches retired without ever
 crossing swords in an official capacity.</i>

00:56.080 --> 01:00.670
<i>This led to the steady decline of both teams.</i>

The heat flickers

01:26.820 --> 01:29.150
Sweat glitters on my skin

01:29.150 --> 01:34.030
Shouts echo and shoulders hit

01:34.030 --> 01:38.700
We asked the sky through the open window

Everybody always wants to stand there,

01:59.810 --> 02:04.520
make mistakes, get angry, and struggle

02:04.520 --> 02:05.860
We'll never give up

02:05.860 --> 02:09.320
We don't want it to end

02:09.320 --> 02:14.820
I will continue on with my imagination

02:16.320 --> 02:21.040
I want to struggle and fall and become stronger

02:21.040 --> 02:25.750
I want to persevere, stand back up, do it again,

02:25.750 --> 02:27.090
and never give up

02:27.090 --> 02:30.380
Let me run

The Cat and Crow Reunion

02:53.150 --> 02:54.280
Kenma!

02:56.530 --> 02:58.570
Y-Y-You go to Nekoma?!

02:58.570 --> 02:59.910
Uh, yeah.

02:59.910 --> 03:02.870
How come you didn't tell me?

03:02.870 --> 03:04.960
You never asked.

03:06.710 --> 03:09.210
But you said, "See you later"!

03:09.210 --> 03:10.710
You must've known something!

03:11.420 --> 03:15.010
The words "Karasuno High School" were on your T-shirt.

03:15.470 --> 03:16.970
Hey, hey, hey!

03:17.760 --> 03:20.930
What business do you have with our setter?

03:21.970 --> 03:23.100
Hey.

03:23.100 --> 03:24.520
I-I'm sorry!

03:25.310 --> 03:26.690
What about you?

03:27.150 --> 03:31.020
What business do you have with our first-year? Eh?

03:31.020 --> 03:32.400
What's it to you?

03:32.400 --> 03:35.450
You wanna rumble, city boy? Eh?

03:35.860 --> 03:39.620
You're about to rumble in the match we're about to play.

03:39.620 --> 03:42.120
And stop saying "city boy." It's embarrassing.

03:42.790 --> 03:46.660
Yamamoto, stop picking fights all the time.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.000
It makes you look stupid.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.960
I apologize on behalf of my embarrassing teammate.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.670
I apologize for mine as well. I'm very embarrassed.

04:04.430 --> 04:07.140
Female manager... Good!

04:07.140 --> 04:08.060
Right on!

04:08.060 --> 04:11.270
They have a female manager! Yakisoba bun score!

04:11.810 --> 04:14.730
You'll pay for this!

04:14.730 --> 04:16.820
Taketora, stand your ground!

04:17.490 --> 04:20.410
Why do you know one of them personally?

04:20.410 --> 04:22.580
I happened to run into him while we were out jogging.

04:22.580 --> 04:24.330
He's Nekoma's setter.

04:24.330 --> 04:25.830
Setter?

04:27.580 --> 04:29.620
I'm looking forward to our match today.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.340
I'm also looking forward to our match today.

04:32.340 --> 04:35.460
Woo-hoo! The ceiling is so high!

04:34.340 --> 04:35.460
Hold that end.

04:35.460 --> 04:36.590
It's just a ceiling.

04:36.590 --> 04:39.010
<i>Oh, he's the shrewd type.</i>

04:39.430 --> 04:40.800
It's been eight years.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.930
What's the deal with your hair, Ukai?

04:42.930 --> 04:46.310
Shaddup, Naoi. You should try something new for a change!

04:49.310 --> 04:51.100
Hey, Keishin!

04:52.100 --> 04:55.110
It's been a long time, Mr. Nekomata!

04:55.110 --> 04:59.150
I see you still have the face the old man gave you.

04:59.150 --> 05:01.450
I'm Takeda! We spoke on the phone.

05:01.450 --> 05:04.580
Thank you for going out of your way today.

05:04.580 --> 05:07.660
It's hard to ignore all those phone calls.

05:07.660 --> 05:09.120
I had to respond.

05:09.120 --> 05:10.620
Forgive me!

05:10.620 --> 05:12.380
I'm only kidding.

05:12.920 --> 05:16.630
We had ourselves some good 
practice matches in the last three days.

05:16.630 --> 05:18.880
Thank you for the match.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.470
Yes, sir! Thank you!

05:21.430 --> 05:24.850
And I don't care if you're not the old man.

05:24.850 --> 05:26.810
I'll show you no mercy.

05:31.270 --> 05:33.100
To be honest,

05:33.730 --> 05:37.570
we've only just met, and we're still awkward and uncoordinated.

05:37.980 --> 05:40.490
Plus, this is our first match using these members.

05:41.150 --> 05:45.450
I don't know what kind of wall we'll be up against with Nekoma.

05:46.160 --> 05:48.040
But once we are up against that wall...

05:48.910 --> 05:50.500
that will be our chance to rise above it!

05:52.370 --> 05:54.330
We are plasma.

05:54.670 --> 05:56.790
Keep the flow in motion.

05:56.790 --> 06:01.470
Distribute the oxygen so the brain can run smoothly!

06:02.300 --> 06:03.180
Let's go!

06:03.180 --> 06:03.970
Yes, sir!

06:04.800 --> 06:06.930
Kuro, can you stop doing that?

06:06.930 --> 06:08.720
It's kind of embarrassing.

06:08.720 --> 06:11.480
What's wrong with it?! It's for atmosphere.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.810
It's like self-hypnosis.

06:13.810 --> 06:15.230
Exactly.

06:18.150 --> 06:19.190
We made it!

06:18.440 --> 06:19.190
Line up!

06:19.190 --> 06:23.110
It's been a long time since the last Battle of the Garbage Dumpster.

06:24.030 --> 06:29.540
We will now commence the practice match between Nekoma High and Karasuno High!

06:30.290 --> 06:32.500
Let's have a good match!

06:32.960 --> 06:34.750
You aren't nervous today.

06:34.750 --> 06:35.460
Yes, sir.

06:38.590 --> 06:39.840
You're tiny!

06:39.840 --> 06:41.590
D-Don't you mock me!

06:41.590 --> 06:43.300
I'm not mocking you in the slightest!

06:43.300 --> 06:44.430
R-Really?

06:44.430 --> 06:45.130
Yeah!

06:45.130 --> 06:45.970
Tch.

06:46.970 --> 06:49.600
<i>He could at least let his guard down.</i>

06:50.260 --> 06:51.680
Shouyou.

06:51.680 --> 06:55.690
I know I said that I think I have a pretty good team...

06:56.190 --> 06:58.060
but I'm not good.

06:58.860 --> 06:59.980
We all are.

07:03.860 --> 07:05.610
Give us a nice serve, Kenma!

07:05.950 --> 07:06.610
Asahi!

07:06.610 --> 07:07.820
Got it!

07:07.820 --> 07:09.240
I'm sorry. It was too short!

07:09.240 --> 07:11.120
It's your fault for skipping a whole month!

07:11.120 --> 07:12.040
I'm sorry!

07:12.790 --> 07:14.000
Kageyama, cover it!

07:14.000 --> 07:14.500
Right!

07:26.260 --> 07:27.970
That was really fast.

07:27.970 --> 07:28.930
What was that?

07:28.930 --> 07:30.810
A fast attack from that far away?

07:31.220 --> 07:34.310
What was that? He didn't even look at the set.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.100
That's amazing.

07:38.100 --> 07:39.310
I'm surprised.

07:40.860 --> 07:41.900
Good job, Shouyou!

07:41.900 --> 07:43.070
Thank you!

07:43.570 --> 07:45.070
Let's get going!

07:46.320 --> 07:47.740
Fukunaga!

07:47.740 --> 07:49.280
Take that!

07:50.450 --> 07:51.740
Nice receive!

07:52.080 --> 07:53.450
<i>Another fast attack!</i>

08:01.590 --> 08:04.130
You could hardly expect him to retrieve that.

08:04.550 --> 08:05.550
I'm counting on you!

08:08.430 --> 08:09.340
I'm counting on you!

08:09.340 --> 08:10.340
Right.

08:11.010 --> 08:11.850
Well done.

08:12.510 --> 08:13.430
Thank you.

08:14.390 --> 08:16.390
Their libero is a threat.

08:17.310 --> 08:18.810
Hinata, let's go!

08:17.770 --> 08:21.150
He'd never seen Asahi spike before, but he touched it.

08:22.150 --> 08:23.940
I'm sorry!

08:23.360 --> 08:24.900
I'm sorry! Take this!

08:23.940 --> 08:25.480
Hinata, you dumbass!

08:24.900 --> 08:26.030
Sure.

08:26.030 --> 08:27.400
Shake it off, guys!

08:26.650 --> 08:28.400
Noya, go for it!

08:28.400 --> 08:31.200
Nishinoya sure switches a lot.

08:30.530 --> 08:31.200
Left!

08:31.200 --> 08:35.580
Yes, sir. Since the libero specializes in defense, they goes on and off the court many times.

08:35.580 --> 08:44.300
<b>Net</b>

08:35.580 --> 08:44.300
<b>Net</b>

08:35.580 --> 08:44.300
Front row

08:35.580 --> 08:44.300
Front row

08:35.580 --> 08:44.300
Back row

08:35.580 --> 08:44.300
Back row

08:36.290 --> 08:40.040
Our middle blockers, Hinata and Tsukishima, go to the rear to serve,

08:40.040 --> 08:44.300
and once the rally is done,
 they swap positions with Nishinoya.

08:44.300 --> 08:45.960
Now it's my turn!

08:54.100 --> 08:54.930
Right on!

08:54.930 --> 08:56.640
That's ridiculous.

08:57.100 --> 08:57.730
Ooh!

08:57.730 --> 08:59.350
A hasty timeout.

09:00.190 --> 09:03.060
They have a good libero and good spikers.

09:03.690 --> 09:07.280
The most ridiculous of the lot is their setter.

09:07.820 --> 09:09.570
He's a monster.

09:09.570 --> 09:12.740
He quickly sets to the spiker's optimum striking point.

09:12.740 --> 09:15.740
He has the control to thread the needle.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.450
Anyway, you can't do anything about a prodigy.

09:18.790 --> 09:25.340
But they're not gonna win this thing just because they happen to have one prodigy on the team.

09:27.090 --> 09:31.130
If Shouyou is their attack axis, we should stop him.

09:31.130 --> 09:32.510
Shouyou?

09:32.510 --> 09:34.680
Their nimble number ten.

09:34.680 --> 09:37.640
Their number nine and number ten...

09:38.100 --> 09:40.430
are like a demon and his iron club.

09:41.190 --> 09:44.270
We'll take the iron club from the demon.

09:44.940 --> 09:47.690
Nekoma

09:44.940 --> 09:47.690
Nekoma

09:44.940 --> 09:47.690
Karasuno

09:44.940 --> 09:47.690
Karasuno

09:45.560 --> 09:46.770
Let's do this!

09:46.770 --> 09:47.690
This is great!

09:47.690 --> 09:49.360
They're at their best!

09:49.360 --> 09:51.200
They give me the willies.

09:51.200 --> 09:51.860
Huh?

09:52.360 --> 09:56.830
It's as though they're feeling us out. Like we're being scrutinized.

09:59.830 --> 10:00.620
Dammit!

10:00.620 --> 10:02.330
Shake it off!

10:00.620 --> 10:02.330
Nekoma

10:00.620 --> 10:02.330
Nekoma

10:00.620 --> 10:02.330
Karasuno

10:00.620 --> 10:02.330
Karasuno

10:02.670 --> 10:03.750
You almost had it.

10:03.750 --> 10:06.790
<i>Their number seven is keeping up with Hinata.</i>

10:03.750 --> 10:05.170
I'm sorry!

10:07.250 --> 10:09.840
Nekoma has moved their blockers to the side.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.300
Yeah, a dedicated block.

10:13.340 --> 10:17.470
<i>This block isn't designed to keep the ace marked.</i>

10:17.470 --> 10:18.430
<i>Could it be...</i>

10:18.930 --> 10:20.890
<i>They're attempting to lead Hinata?</i>

10:21.810 --> 10:25.100
Just shrink down Shouyou's movement area.

10:26.400 --> 10:31.820
From what I can tell, Shouyou simply charges to wherever there are no blockers.

10:32.570 --> 10:36.320
So if we put our blockers on one side, he'll move to the opposite side.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.910
After that, keep following him.

10:38.910 --> 10:40.080
Yes, sir!

10:40.080 --> 10:45.250
I think that anyone would be taken by surprise seeing their fast attack for the first time.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.800
In a game, the more you repeat a level you can't pass at first...

10:52.340 --> 10:53.380
the more you get used to it.

10:54.050 --> 10:56.800
<i>Follow number ten. Follow number ten.</i>

11:00.430 --> 11:01.350
<i>He touched it again?!</i>

11:04.270 --> 11:05.520
It's a fast attack!

11:09.230 --> 11:10.480
Damn.

11:10.480 --> 11:11.650
Shake it off!

11:10.900 --> 11:12.360
A setter dump.

11:13.610 --> 11:16.030
Hey, don't get too tense.

11:16.360 --> 11:18.370
They can see through the cracks.

11:20.580 --> 11:21.450
Forward!

11:22.790 --> 11:24.460
I'm sorry, Noya! Cover it!

11:24.460 --> 11:25.250
I've got it!

11:25.540 --> 11:26.210
Right!

11:26.750 --> 11:28.920
What?! Kageyama called for a set?!

11:28.920 --> 11:30.630
Kageyama, finish it!

11:37.180 --> 11:39.390
Hey! That was a straight spike!

11:39.390 --> 11:40.600
You go straight along the line.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.310
You need to learn to choose your hits!

11:44.060 --> 11:47.020
It seriously pisses me off how he's so good at everything.

11:47.020 --> 11:48.270
You said it.

11:48.270 --> 11:49.980
Nekoma

11:48.270 --> 11:49.980
Nekoma

11:48.270 --> 11:49.980
Karasuno

11:48.270 --> 11:49.980
Karasuno

11:52.570 --> 11:53.650
Nice tip, Tsukishima!

11:54.570 --> 11:56.570
<i>This guy is smart.</i>

11:56.570 --> 11:59.620
<i>He thinks calmly and observes his surroundings.</i>

11:59.620 --> 12:01.370
<i>The exact opposite of Shouyou.</i>

12:02.530 --> 12:03.080
Nice serve!

12:03.080 --> 12:03.990
Yamamoto!

12:03.990 --> 12:04.950
All right!

12:05.960 --> 12:07.080
Nice receive!

12:07.620 --> 12:09.540
<i>Which side should I give it to?</i>

12:09.960 --> 12:10.540
<i>The right?</i>

12:11.590 --> 12:12.210
<i>No, the left.</i>

12:13.420 --> 12:15.380
<i>He did watch closely, as I thought.</i>

12:15.380 --> 12:16.630
<i>And he has fast reflexes.</i>

12:18.590 --> 12:20.340
All right!

12:21.390 --> 12:24.060
<i>That glance was a decoy!</i>

12:24.520 --> 12:26.180
Because he's not good with people,

12:26.180 --> 12:31.020
he became so self-conscious of where they were looking that he became very observant of their eyes.

12:31.610 --> 12:33.400
He's good at predicting his opponents' moves.

12:33.400 --> 12:37.650
He can predict how someone will act based on what their personality is like.

12:38.610 --> 12:42.200
Although, that isn't what makes our team strong.

12:43.120 --> 12:43.160
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:43.160 --> 12:43.200
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:43.200 --> 12:43.240
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:43.200 --> 12:43.240
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:43.240 --> 12:43.280
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:43.240 --> 12:43.280
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:43.280 --> 12:43.330
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:43.280 --> 12:43.330
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:43.330 --> 12:50.000
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:43.330 --> 12:50.000
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:50.000 --> 12:50.000

12:50.120 --> 12:50.170
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:50.170 --> 12:50.210
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:50.210 --> 12:50.250

12:50.210 --> 12:50.250

12:50.250 --> 12:50.290
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:50.250 --> 12:50.290
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:50.290 --> 12:50.330
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:50.290 --> 12:50.330
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:50.330 --> 12:57.010
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:50.330 --> 12:57.010
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:59.130 --> 13:03.970
<i>I've never had any luck making friends.</i>

13:04.390 --> 13:07.140
<i>I wasn't good around people, 
so I wanted nothing to do with them.</i>

13:07.140 --> 13:09.310
<i>But I became extremely self-conscious of their eyes.</i>

13:10.230 --> 13:12.810
<i>I didn't let it get to me so that I wouldn't stand out.</i>

13:13.730 --> 13:17.320
<i>My only playmate was Kuro, 
who was my age and lived nearby.</i>

13:18.780 --> 13:24.120
<i>I don't really like sports, 
but I've always fiddled with volleyball.</i>

13:24.580 --> 13:28.620
<i>In junior high, Kuro persuaded me to join the volleyball team.</i>

13:29.250 --> 13:30.830
<i>It was a little fun.</i>

13:31.330 --> 13:34.210
<i>In high school, I found myself still playing it.</i>

13:35.000 --> 13:37.800
<i>Our school had a good team not long ago.</i>

13:38.170 --> 13:40.090
<i>There were so many people.</i>

13:40.090 --> 13:42.010
<i>I decided I couldn't handle it.</i>

13:42.010 --> 13:45.260
Hey, first-year! You need to clean up faster or we can't go home!

13:45.760 --> 13:50.600
<i>The people we call upperclassmen just happened to be born a year or two before us.</i>

13:50.600 --> 13:52.730
<i>So why do they act so bossy?</i>

13:55.360 --> 13:56.440
Don't quit on me.

13:57.110 --> 13:59.820
You have keen observational skills,

13:59.820 --> 14:01.450
and you deliver accurate instructions.

14:01.950 --> 14:05.030
The current first-years and second-years know how great you are.

14:06.080 --> 14:08.290
You'll definitely make the team stronger.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.750
He doesn't stand out.

14:14.750 --> 14:15.250
Huh?

14:15.920 --> 14:21.340
It's obvious to an amateur that 
Kageyama gives off sharp vibes.

14:21.340 --> 14:27.390
Nekoma's setter might indeed be doing amazing things, 
but it's hard to tell by looking at him.

14:28.260 --> 14:31.140
That's due to the consistency of their receiving.

14:31.600 --> 14:35.190
The most important thing to set up a wide variety of attacks is

14:35.190 --> 14:39.150
receives that deliver the ball neatly above the head of the setter.

14:39.150 --> 14:43.110
Those receives enable their setter to utilize his best potential.

14:44.280 --> 14:49.580
Kageyama is holding together his uncoordinated team with overwhelming talent,

14:49.910 --> 14:54.290
while Nekoma's setter, Kozume, is supported by the receiving skills of his entire team.

14:55.750 --> 14:57.840
<i>We are plasma.</i>

14:57.840 --> 14:59.800
<i>Keep the flow in motion.</i>

14:59.800 --> 15:01.260
<i>Distribute the oxygen.</i>

15:02.170 --> 15:05.090
<i>So the brain can run smoothly!</i>

15:09.600 --> 15:10.680
I touched it!

15:10.680 --> 15:12.350
Nice cover, Yaku!

15:12.350 --> 15:14.810
We don't need a superman for an ace.

15:15.770 --> 15:20.730
As long as we earn the points one by one, slowly but surely.

15:21.230 --> 15:21.940
Take that!

15:21.940 --> 15:24.320
Nekoma

15:21.940 --> 15:24.320
Nekoma

15:21.940 --> 15:24.320
Karasuno

15:21.940 --> 15:24.320
Karasuno

15:22.860 --> 15:24.320
Yeah!

15:24.570 --> 15:27.990
Kageyama, I'm going to make the next spike count, so set for me!

15:27.990 --> 15:30.490
Right now, it's set point for the opponent.

15:30.490 --> 15:32.200
Mess up, and we lose the set.

15:33.370 --> 15:35.620
I know! I'll do it!

15:37.370 --> 15:38.330
Nice receive!

15:39.420 --> 15:45.050
In a game, the more you repeat a level you can't pass at first...

15:50.800 --> 15:51.970
the more you get used to it.

15:57.230 --> 15:59.190
Nekoma              Karasuno

15:57.230 --> 15:59.190
Nekoma              Karasuno

15:59.770 --> 16:01.400
I finally caught you!

16:01.900 --> 16:03.400
All right!

16:05.320 --> 16:07.820
Hey, we can't let each little thing get us down.

16:07.820 --> 16:09.530
We're going to take back the next set!

16:09.530 --> 16:12.200
There's no spike that can't be stopped.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.040
Don't get distracted.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.660
Let's nail the next one, Hinata!

16:14.660 --> 16:15.790
Smash it in.

16:17.620 --> 16:18.330
Yes, sir!

16:21.170 --> 16:22.420
Not again.

16:23.380 --> 16:25.300
Nice block, Inuoka!

16:24.170 --> 16:26.630
<i>Their number seven is no fluke.</i>

16:26.630 --> 16:28.590
<i>He's learning how Hinata moves.</i>

16:31.760 --> 16:33.720
Karasuno               Nekoma

16:31.760 --> 16:33.720
Karasuno               Nekoma

16:36.980 --> 16:38.440
Daichi, nice cover!

16:38.440 --> 16:39.480
Left!

16:39.480 --> 16:40.400
Tanaka!

16:39.480 --> 16:42.310
Do you want to ask why I don't swap out Hinata?

16:42.310 --> 16:42.900
All right!

16:42.900 --> 16:44.360
Not really.

16:44.940 --> 16:47.490
If this was an official match, I might swap him out.

16:48.150 --> 16:51.070
But right now, this is his chance to find the solution.

16:51.450 --> 16:56.830
However, if that results in Hinata losing his will to fight, maybe I should take him out of the match once.

17:00.790 --> 17:01.420
<i>He's going around!</i>

17:04.880 --> 17:05.710
Shit!

17:06.000 --> 17:06.920
It's no good!

17:07.260 --> 17:08.840
All right!

17:10.720 --> 17:14.890
<i>Completely shut out in the first and last match in junior high.</i>

17:15.430 --> 17:18.600
<i>No match for Tsukishima's height in high school.</i>

17:19.310 --> 17:24.440
<i>But he finally obtained a way to fight opponents far taller than himself.</i>

17:24.440 --> 17:27.990
<i>To Hinata, this is his sole, most powerful attack.</i>

17:28.400 --> 17:31.490
<i>All prevented by a single blocker!</i>

17:32.110 --> 17:34.660
It's the spirit-breaking "human wall."

17:34.660 --> 17:38.120
The more you hit it, the more your spirit breaks.

17:48.090 --> 17:49.260
He's smiling.

17:50.590 --> 17:51.590
Hey.

17:51.590 --> 17:53.970
It's different somehow.

17:54.970 --> 18:00.640
It's not the same as back when I felt confused because I couldn't see the other side past the blockers

18:00.640 --> 18:02.480
and didn't know what to do.

18:02.980 --> 18:04.400
It's different somehow.

18:05.480 --> 18:08.730
I can tell that my opponent is having trouble keeping up with me.

18:08.730 --> 18:12.070
Until now, I felt fear and hate when I was blocked.

18:12.490 --> 18:15.570
Now, I get excited when he shows up in front of me.

18:16.620 --> 18:21.830
With your sets and some kind of plan,
 I think I can get it past him.

18:23.370 --> 18:27.170
So please send one more set my way!

18:29.500 --> 18:30.800
That goes without saying.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.800
Karasuno               Nekoma

18:31.840 --> 18:33.800
Karasuno               Nekoma

18:32.420 --> 18:33.800
Give us a nice serve!

18:39.720 --> 18:40.430
What?

18:48.110 --> 18:50.480
Hinata was looking at...

18:50.480 --> 18:51.860
...the set.

18:51.860 --> 18:56.820
Until now, he left the ball fully up to Kageyama and just took the swing!

18:56.820 --> 18:58.660
T-Time out!

19:02.250 --> 19:05.040
I-It's not like I don't trust your sets...

19:05.040 --> 19:06.710
How can I say it?

19:06.710 --> 19:08.380
Why are you panicking?

19:08.380 --> 19:12.840
Kageyama, I want you to give 
slightly weaker sets to Hinata.

19:13.510 --> 19:16.220
Rather than the usual direct delivery...

19:16.220 --> 19:17.970
Indirect delivery.

19:18.680 --> 19:19.260
In...

19:19.600 --> 19:22.850
Rather than the usual powerful, straight trajectory set,

19:22.850 --> 19:24.890
it needs to float a little.

19:25.730 --> 19:29.440
It might be tricky to change it up this sudden.

19:30.440 --> 19:31.360
I'll do it.

19:32.980 --> 19:35.490
Why would you have him change the set?

19:35.490 --> 19:38.370
To give Hinata freedom in midair.

19:38.370 --> 19:41.620
A moment ago, Hinata attempted to dodge the blocker in midair.

19:41.620 --> 19:42.160
What?

19:42.830 --> 19:47.370
He probably tried to mimic Kageyama's technique to dodge a blocker.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.090
Although it was crap.

19:56.630 --> 20:02.430
<i>Until now, I've hit the ball without a thought in my head, so it's confusing to suddenly be the one aligning the shot!</i>

20:02.430 --> 20:07.390
Karasuno               Nekoma

20:02.430 --> 20:07.390
Karasuno               Nekoma

20:02.810 --> 20:04.180
One more timeout!

20:05.100 --> 20:06.770
Hinata, you need to calm down.

20:06.770 --> 20:07.390
Yes, sir!

20:07.810 --> 20:11.190
I'm sorry. I keep making mistakes.

20:11.190 --> 20:12.690
Go on!

20:12.690 --> 20:15.780
I always get to hit the ball unmarked thanks to you!

20:15.780 --> 20:19.490
I think I'm allowed to totally own a match once in a while!

20:19.490 --> 20:21.700
Although Asahi is scoring more points than you!

20:21.700 --> 20:23.910
You shaddup! Anyway, it's all good!

20:23.910 --> 20:25.200
Right, Asahi?

20:25.200 --> 20:26.620
Uh, yeah. He's right.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.080
We'll make back the points.

20:30.210 --> 20:33.960
If you keep screwing up, you could be swapped out.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.050
Tsukishima!

20:36.090 --> 20:38.880
If you're on the verge of learning something, keep at it.

20:38.880 --> 20:40.260
You jump alone,

20:41.010 --> 20:43.220
but we're all here, right behind you.

20:45.180 --> 20:48.810
After all, the ace claims he's going to win back all those points.

20:49.100 --> 20:51.650
Daichi, don't put pressure on Asahi!

20:51.650 --> 20:53.230
You wouldn't wanna damage him.

20:53.230 --> 20:55.940
That's right! His heart is very fragile!

20:56.900 --> 20:58.650
Please make it stop!

21:01.570 --> 21:02.910
Asahi!

21:02.910 --> 21:04.080
Left!

21:04.870 --> 21:06.120
Go!

21:06.120 --> 21:07.370
Nice hit!

21:07.370 --> 21:08.830
Karasuno               Nekoma

21:07.370 --> 21:08.830
Karasuno               Nekoma

21:10.290 --> 21:13.210
Aw, it's all he can do to return it.

21:13.960 --> 21:16.420
What would it take to make it go smoother?

21:16.420 --> 21:20.010
Nobody can be expected to get a play right the first time.

21:18.170 --> 21:19.590
Nice receive!

21:19.590 --> 21:20.930
Send it my way!

21:20.010 --> 21:24.220
But the initial effort is the beginning in all things.

21:25.180 --> 21:28.060
Remember how the Little Giant used to play for Karasuno?

21:28.060 --> 21:30.190
Hinata's dream ace?

21:30.640 --> 21:37.150
True to his name, he stood at around 170 cm,
 and at first, he kept being stopped by blockers.

21:37.690 --> 21:42.610
But by the latter half of his second year, no one could match him in aerial battle.

21:43.700 --> 21:47.370
He couldn't compete with the high blockers, so he aimed for the gap and fired.

21:47.950 --> 21:51.330
He would intentionally hit the blockers' fingertips and make it ricochet.

21:51.330 --> 21:55.590
That's how he found a way for a smaller guy like himself to fight.

21:56.460 --> 21:59.300
At least, that's according to what my gramps told me.

21:59.300 --> 22:01.300
You mean the previous Coach Ukai?

22:01.300 --> 22:05.800
Yeah. I remember what my gramps told me very clearly.

22:07.470 --> 22:09.060
Man doesn't have wings,

22:09.720 --> 22:12.060
so he finds a way to fly.

22:29.700 --> 22:31.660
Aw! It's out!

22:32.750 --> 22:34.790
That was amazing!

22:34.790 --> 22:36.380
That was amazing, Shouyou!

22:39.670 --> 22:40.920
One more time!

22:42.010 --> 22:42.010
{ED}

22:52.640 --> 22:56.560
If I tell you this story,

22:56.560 --> 23:00.320
I wonder if I can explain to you

23:00.820 --> 23:04.780
my feelings

23:04.780 --> 23:07.780
and the distance between us

23:08.490 --> 23:16.460
Standing on an empty field

23:16.790 --> 23:25.380
I breathe out into the night air

23:25.380 --> 23:29.930
Countless times I swore that I would change

23:29.930 --> 23:33.930
I stumbled and fell a lot,

23:33.930 --> 23:37.900
but I swore I would laugh at the end

23:37.900 --> 23:41.820
and not let my tears go to waste

23:41.820 --> 23:45.820
There are so many dreams that can definitely come true

23:45.820 --> 23:49.820
I always sat somewhere, downcast, dejected, depressed,

23:49.820 --> 23:52.370
but still I decided I would fight,

23:52.370 --> 23:57.370
and not let all my frustration go to waste

23:57.370 --> 24:01.710
This is our revenge
