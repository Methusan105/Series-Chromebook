WEBVTT

00:01.110 --> 00:02.230
One more!

00:02.230 --> 00:03.360
Gimme one more!

00:03.360 --> 00:05.280
Shut up! You don't need to tell me!

00:05.280 --> 00:05.990
Here it comes!

00:05.990 --> 00:06.780
Yeah!

00:12.240 --> 00:14.740
Man, that felt amazing!

00:15.410 --> 00:18.960
<i>And I can feel the full weight of the ball in my palm.</i>

00:19.540 --> 00:20.630
<i>I love it!</i>

00:26.090 --> 00:27.220
Hell yeah!

00:27.800 --> 00:30.680
Our fast attacks are gonna run roughshod over Neko!

00:31.840 --> 00:32.600
<i>Neko?</i>

00:33.260 --> 00:35.310
<i>They're playing </i>Nekoma<i>?</i>

00:35.810 --> 00:38.810
We're playing a practice match at the end of Golden Week.

00:38.810 --> 00:39.730
Ack!

00:39.730 --> 00:41.850
What was that for? And stop running from me!

00:42.150 --> 00:44.820
I don't want to be anywhere near you when you get mad.

00:44.820 --> 00:46.570
But I'm not mad right now!

00:48.530 --> 00:53.950
Well, talk of Nekoma always sounded like a history lesson to us.

00:53.950 --> 00:58.040
Our teams don't really have that rivalry anymore.

00:58.790 --> 00:59.410
That said,

01:00.040 --> 01:02.710
the "Battle of the Garbage Dumpster: Cat vs Crow" is making a comeback!

01:03.580 --> 01:08.170
We've heard so much about Neko, and now we're gonna be playing them for the first time in years.

01:08.170 --> 01:10.220
Doesn't that get you a little hyped?

01:12.010 --> 01:16.720
But I don't know how to face Suga or Nishinoya.

01:18.770 --> 01:20.180
Oh, come on.

01:20.810 --> 01:24.270
For all your size, you're still a wimp on the inside, huh?

01:24.270 --> 01:26.320
You and Nishinoya are like polar opposites.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.400
Can't you sugarcoat your words a little?

01:30.240 --> 01:31.490
Relax.

01:31.490 --> 01:33.870
Neither Suga nor Nishinoya will have a problem with it.

01:33.870 --> 01:36.740
Unlike you, they have big hearts.

01:36.740 --> 01:40.250
Weren't you supposed to be an all-round nice guy?

01:40.250 --> 01:42.290
You get special treatment,

01:42.290 --> 01:43.540
wimp that you are.

01:44.670 --> 01:46.590
Who cares if you played hooky for a month?

01:46.590 --> 01:49.510
So what if things are awkward and you're finding it hard to show up?

01:49.920 --> 01:51.630
None of that matters.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.510
If there's a chance you might still like volleyball,

01:56.430 --> 01:58.220
then that's reason enough to come back.

01:59.930 --> 02:01.640
Oh, and one more thing.

02:02.440 --> 02:04.980
You can't let a guy who idolizes aces down, right?

02:11.990 --> 02:13.030
Ow!

02:13.990 --> 02:13.990
{OP}

02:18.620 --> 02:20.830
The heat flickers

02:20.830 --> 02:23.160
Sweat glitters on my skin

02:23.160 --> 02:28.040
Shouts echo and shoulders hit

02:28.040 --> 02:32.720
We asked the sky through the open window

02:28.170 --> 02:34.220
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

02:29.050 --> 02:34.220
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

02:32.720 --> 02:36.590

02:36.590 --> 02:38.810
Tell me, Mr. Future

02:38.810 --> 02:40.560
Come on, come on, come on

02:40.560 --> 02:43.140
The chance is there

02:43.560 --> 02:45.140
Come on, come on, come on

02:45.140 --> 02:47.310
Do it together

02:49.230 --> 02:53.820
Everybody always wants to stand there,

02:53.820 --> 02:58.530
make mistakes, get angry, and struggle

02:58.530 --> 02:59.870
We'll never give up

02:59.870 --> 03:03.330
We don't want it to end

03:03.330 --> 03:08.840
I will continue on with my imagination

03:10.340 --> 03:15.050
I want to struggle and fall and become stronger

03:15.050 --> 03:19.760
I want to persevere, stand back up, do it again,

03:19.760 --> 03:21.100
and never give up

03:21.100 --> 03:24.390
Let me run

03:24.390 --> 03:30.230
I will run to where my imagination leads me

03:44.000 --> 03:44.000
{Part A}

03:44.000 --> 03:49.630
<b>Foot of the Slope</b>

03:44.410 --> 03:49.630
On the bank of the flowing Hirose River...

03:44.750 --> 03:49.130
Episode Nine:
A Set For the Ace

03:44.750 --> 03:49.130
Episode Nine:
A Set For the Ace

03:49.630 --> 03:55.010
I'm remembering what can't return...

03:55.300 --> 04:00.010
In the dancing brightness of the rapids...

04:01.720 --> 04:03.140
Wh-What are you doing?!

04:03.140 --> 04:06.850
I'm sorry! I was checking to see if you had customers.

04:06.850 --> 04:08.900
Is this about coaching again?

04:08.900 --> 04:09.980
Yes.

04:11.650 --> 04:14.860
I still love to play.

04:14.860 --> 04:17.240
I put together a neighborhood team.

04:17.780 --> 04:20.570
I'd hate being a coach 'cause I'd be dying to join in.

04:20.570 --> 04:21.530
I see.

04:21.530 --> 04:24.580
Besides, I don't want to go near that gym.

04:24.580 --> 04:26.950
D-Do you have bad memories of the place?

04:26.950 --> 04:30.540
The opposite! It's packed with memories of my youth.

04:30.540 --> 04:31.880
Then why?

04:33.840 --> 04:38.300
I don't care if that gym and our clubroom haven't changed.

04:38.300 --> 04:41.090
I absolutely can't go back there.

04:41.890 --> 04:44.810
The limited time I spent there felt unique.

04:45.680 --> 04:49.100
It's like breathing the air from a bygone era.

04:49.730 --> 04:52.480
So you're nostalgic? You're lucky.

04:52.480 --> 04:53.360
Oh, be quiet!

04:54.570 --> 04:56.530
That's why I don't want to go back there!

04:58.610 --> 05:00.950
What if I said Nekoma High was coming?

05:01.360 --> 05:05.740
At the end of Golden Week, we have our first practice match with them in five years.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.910
What did... you just say?

05:08.370 --> 05:14.880
Coach Nekomata, who had such a profound friendship with Coach Ukai, has recently come out of retirement.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.260
When I heard this, I asked for a practice match.

05:19.170 --> 05:24.220
In your day, wasn't that when the two teams had the closest ties?

05:24.220 --> 05:24.890
Yeah.

05:25.930 --> 05:32.650
Which reminds me, their current coach
 played setter at Nekoma 7 or 8 years ago.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.820
This year will be our final chance, Ukai.

05:37.400 --> 05:40.400
I want to see you at nationals, got it?

05:40.400 --> 05:41.030
Right!

05:42.490 --> 05:43.490
I'll be there!

05:44.620 --> 05:46.950
That was when you were part of the volleyball team,

05:47.580 --> 05:50.540
so perhaps you two know one another.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.160
Hey.

05:53.250 --> 05:54.960
Are you trying to aggravate me?!

05:54.960 --> 05:56.670
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

05:56.670 --> 06:00.630
Bullshit! You're obviously trying to aggravate me! Do you seriously think that's gonna work?!

06:00.630 --> 06:02.220
When does practice start?!

06:02.220 --> 06:02.930
I'm sorr—

06:03.550 --> 06:04.090
Huh?

06:05.430 --> 06:06.050
Um...

06:06.470 --> 06:10.520
I can't allow Nekoma to see my juniors in their current deplorable state!

06:10.520 --> 06:12.440
I'm getting changed! Stay right there!

06:12.440 --> 06:13.730
Sure!

06:13.730 --> 06:15.770
Mom, mind the store for me!

06:17.770 --> 06:18.730
Yes!

06:19.360 --> 06:21.690
Yeah, hello? Tattsuan?

06:30.910 --> 06:32.330
Say, Noya?

06:32.330 --> 06:33.580
Yeah?

06:33.580 --> 06:36.790
How did you train while you were suspended?

06:37.840 --> 06:39.500
I focused on blocked ball retrieval.

06:40.380 --> 06:42.970
Specialized training to retrieve any blocked ball!

06:43.420 --> 06:47.640
I'm not that great at it, 
but if I can just retrieve blocked balls,

06:47.640 --> 06:50.680
you guys can go for your spikes without worrying as much.

06:52.560 --> 06:56.400
<i>The guy seems to have a bruise in a new place every time I see him.</i>

06:57.190 --> 07:00.400
Noya, you are totally, utterly cool!

07:00.400 --> 07:02.110
Why are you crying?!

07:03.240 --> 07:04.700
Hello!

07:04.700 --> 07:05.860
Gather 'round!

07:07.320 --> 07:11.540
Allow me to introduce you to Ukai, your coach as of today!

07:17.210 --> 07:19.130
Coach?

07:19.130 --> 07:20.460
Do you mean it?!

07:20.460 --> 07:22.670
Only for the duration of your match with Nekoma.

07:22.670 --> 07:23.380
Oh.

07:23.710 --> 07:26.930
What? He's the guy who runs Foot of the Slope right?

07:26.930 --> 07:28.640
Is he really our coach?

07:28.640 --> 07:32.430
He graduated from Karasuno, 
and he's the grandson of the famous Coach Ukai.

07:32.430 --> 07:33.310
What?!

07:33.930 --> 07:38.310
But your store isn't named after you, right? I mean, sir?!

07:38.310 --> 07:40.270
The store comes from mom's side of the family.

07:40.980 --> 07:43.280
There's no time! Let's get started!

07:43.280 --> 07:47.320
I want to see how you guys play, so we have a match at 6:30.

07:47.320 --> 07:48.740
I called in your opponents.

07:48.740 --> 07:49.740
Opponents?

07:50.740 --> 07:52.870
The Karasuno Neighborhood Association team.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.250
If there's a chance you might still like volleyball,

08:02.920 --> 08:04.880
then that's reason enough to come back.

08:10.850 --> 08:12.100
I'm going in!

08:12.100 --> 08:13.100
Right!

08:14.470 --> 08:15.350
I'm going!

08:16.230 --> 08:18.350
Damn, he isn't picking up.

08:18.980 --> 08:21.810
I guess assembling the gang this late on a weekday was too much to ask.

08:29.280 --> 08:29.660
Here.

08:30.740 --> 08:32.870
Th-Thank you.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.450
Hello!

08:34.450 --> 08:35.330
Yo.

08:35.330 --> 08:36.160
Damn!

08:36.160 --> 08:37.080
This takes me back!

08:38.000 --> 08:39.540
Excuse me?

08:41.170 --> 08:42.460
Team Neighborhood Association...

08:44.460 --> 08:45.800
...is on the scene!

08:46.880 --> 08:49.550
Hey! Thanks for coming out at the drop of a hat like this, guys!

08:49.550 --> 08:51.220
That's for sure!

08:49.550 --> 08:53.680
I envisioned older guys when he said neighborhood association.

08:51.220 --> 08:52.390
You owe me one.

08:52.390 --> 08:53.680
Oh, fine.

08:53.680 --> 08:54.510
Same here.

08:56.060 --> 08:58.980
Okay, let's get this thing started!

08:58.980 --> 08:59.640
Yeah!

08:59.640 --> 09:00.690
Game on!

09:02.690 --> 09:04.650
Hey, you. What's wrong?

09:05.780 --> 09:07.990
I'm sorry. He's not ready.

09:07.990 --> 09:10.360
What's the deal? Issues? Injury?

09:10.360 --> 09:13.240
No, it's not that straightforward.

09:13.240 --> 09:15.280
What, so he's not injured?

09:15.280 --> 09:18.870
I dunno what the deal is, but join the neighborhood team.

09:18.870 --> 09:21.460
Our libero is tied up at work.

09:21.460 --> 09:22.880
Oh, in that case.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.470
What'll we do about the other two?

09:29.470 --> 09:31.220
You have more people, right?

09:30.420 --> 09:32.300
Hey! It's Asahi!

09:33.390 --> 09:35.220
Asahi!

09:35.550 --> 09:37.180
Ugh! Him again.

09:37.180 --> 09:39.180
I was just, um...

09:38.140 --> 09:39.180
Asahi?!

09:39.600 --> 09:41.810
A tardy guy? Are you jerkin' my chain?!

09:41.810 --> 09:42.980
State your position!

09:43.690 --> 09:44.900
Wing spiker.

09:44.900 --> 09:47.900
We need players! Get the hell in here and get warmed up!

09:47.900 --> 09:49.070
Make it snappy!

10:14.890 --> 10:16.850
Now all we need is a setter.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.810
I wanna do it, but I have to watch from the outside.

10:20.720 --> 10:23.270
Loan me one of your setters.

10:27.730 --> 10:28.570
Sugawara!

10:30.190 --> 10:32.030
You're not deferring to me, are you?

10:32.700 --> 10:37.490
If rising in the ranks comes at your expense, I'm out.

10:39.410 --> 10:45.000
This whole time, I prepared to fight you for the starting position.

10:45.620 --> 10:47.960
But after you joined the team,
 I think I felt relieved somehow.

10:48.840 --> 10:51.510
The setter is a team's attack axis.

10:51.510 --> 10:53.420
He must be steadfast.

10:54.130 --> 10:58.100
But I was too freaked out to set properly.

10:59.640 --> 11:04.770
I was so afraid of submitting the spiker to repeated blocks because of my sets,

11:05.560 --> 11:08.560
that I hid in the shadow of
 Kageyama's overwhelming talent.

11:09.610 --> 11:11.730
It was comfortable there.

11:14.150 --> 11:18.410
The very thought of a spike being blocked still scares me.

11:19.660 --> 11:20.450
That said...

11:21.120 --> 11:24.540
Please let me set for you one more time, Asahi.

11:27.210 --> 11:29.380
That's why I'm going on this side.

11:29.380 --> 11:30.710
And Kageyama?

11:32.460 --> 11:33.460
I'm not gonna lose.

11:34.670 --> 11:35.590
Me neither.

11:36.840 --> 11:39.390
Nishinoya, give me those good receives of yours!

11:39.390 --> 11:40.550
Naturally!

11:43.470 --> 11:45.640
Okay, let's get ready!

11:44.310 --> 11:46.230
Asahi came! See?

11:46.850 --> 11:48.690
Yeah, for now.

11:48.690 --> 11:52.150
Karasuno        Neighborhood Assoc.

11:48.690 --> 11:52.150
Karasuno        Neighborhood Assoc.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.570
Let's have a good match!

11:53.070 --> 11:55.110
He really is intimidating.

11:55.740 --> 11:58.070
Come at me, high schoolers!

Nice receive!

12:25.390 --> 12:27.140
Looking good!

12:27.140 --> 12:28.270
Nice set.

12:28.940 --> 12:29.980
Thank you, sir!

12:30.270 --> 12:32.270
Sugawara's fast attack!

12:32.270 --> 12:35.940
Well, duh. Suga is a respectable setter in his own right!

12:36.360 --> 12:37.900
<i>He looks so happy.</i>

12:38.820 --> 12:40.700
Suga, nice set!

12:41.530 --> 12:46.500
Only because they're adjusting their team play for my benefit.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.120
They're real veterans.

12:49.210 --> 12:51.080
My setting still needs work.

12:52.710 --> 13:01.430
We need to keep using fast attacks and play hardball, or the match will ride on the ace again like before.

13:03.970 --> 13:06.350
Suga, you've gotten really cool.

13:06.350 --> 13:07.930
What? You think so?

13:07.930 --> 13:10.440
That's kinda awesome, coming from you.

13:11.230 --> 13:12.480
Why is that?

13:12.480 --> 13:13.480
You know...

13:15.360 --> 13:19.110
<i>Suga, you've gotten really reliable since I last saw you.</i>

13:19.650 --> 13:22.110
<i>Nishinoya is as reliable as ever.</i>

13:20.070 --> 13:22.570
No, I mean it. You've gotten really cool.

13:23.450 --> 13:28.620
<i>But here I am, drifting back to the team and standing on the court again.</i>

13:29.500 --> 13:31.040
<i>It's pathetic.</i>

13:31.790 --> 13:32.790
<i>However...</i>

13:35.500 --> 13:36.630
You can do it!

13:36.630 --> 13:37.670

13:39.170 --> 13:44.050
<i>However, I really do love it here.</i>

13:48.560 --> 13:49.270
What the?

13:49.600 --> 13:50.770
Right on!

13:51.140 --> 13:53.560
That guy really flew!

13:53.560 --> 13:55.730
That set was dead-on.

13:59.190 --> 14:01.400
Good job, Hinata, Kageyama!

14:01.820 --> 14:05.910
<i>But now, with this guy setting for me, I can evade any block, no matter how high it may be.</i>

14:05.910 --> 14:08.040
<i>The blockers vanish from my sight,</i>

14:08.040 --> 14:11.040
<i>and I get a clear view of the other side of the net.</i>

14:13.750 --> 14:16.170
<i>The other side of the net.</i>

14:23.760 --> 14:24.760

<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

14:40.610 --> 14:41.400
Shit.

14:41.820 --> 14:44.910
They failed, but their libero is amazing.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.620
I'm sorry! I'll save the next one!

14:44.910 --> 14:46.620
Yeah. He's on another level.

14:47.370 --> 14:49.030
If it wasn't for that attacker...

14:50.370 --> 14:52.290
<i>Blocked again.</i>

14:52.290 --> 14:54.540
<i>I've lost count of them now.</i>

14:55.370 --> 14:57.330
<i>I called for so many sets.</i>

14:57.330 --> 15:00.300
<i>"Send them my way. I'll make them count."</i>

15:00.300 --> 15:02.510
<i>But when all was said and done...</i>

15:03.090 --> 15:05.970
<i>I became too scared to call for the set.</i>

15:20.110 --> 15:21.020
Shit!

15:24.440 --> 15:27.990
I couldn't retrieve a single blocked ball!

15:30.080 --> 15:32.660
Why?! Why aren't you putting the blame on me?!

15:33.200 --> 15:35.210
We only lost the match because of me!

15:35.210 --> 15:39.590
Any ball you could've saved would've been pointless because I couldn't make them count!

15:38.960 --> 15:39.590
Asahi!

15:43.760 --> 15:45.590
What do you mean, pointless?

15:46.590 --> 15:49.600
Okay, then why didn't you call for the set at the end?

15:50.220 --> 15:52.140
You were in position.

15:53.270 --> 15:55.100
Lay off, Nishinoya!

15:55.100 --> 15:57.350
It's my fault for sending all the sets his way. He got overwor—

15:57.350 --> 16:00.610
Even if you did set it for me, I couldn't make it count.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.740
You don't know that until you hit the damned thing!

16:04.740 --> 16:07.910
You never know! The next one might get through!

16:10.950 --> 16:15.160
Don't you dare give up on a ball I keep in play!

16:15.160 --> 16:16.210
Noya!

16:17.540 --> 16:18.920
I'm a libero!

16:18.920 --> 16:21.790
I'm pivotal to defense, and pivotal to the team!

16:22.500 --> 16:26.130
But I can't earn us any points.

16:28.630 --> 16:33.760
I can't attack, but I don't care how many spikes don't get through.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.180
I wouldn't blame you in the least.

16:37.180 --> 16:40.400
However, I don't forgive anyone who up and quits on me!

16:46.690 --> 16:48.530
Asahi!

16:48.530 --> 16:49.990
Wait, Asahi!

16:59.790 --> 17:02.420
Why didn't you come to practice yesterday?

17:03.630 --> 17:07.380
The interhigh happens soon after the start of the new school year.

17:08.260 --> 17:11.260
It's no fun hitting spikes that count for nothing.

17:11.590 --> 17:15.100
<i>What am I talking about? That's not how I think at all.</i>

17:15.850 --> 17:19.770
It's gotta be futile for you to retrieve balls that never count.

17:19.770 --> 17:23.560
<i>Stop it. Nishinoya doesn't think like that.</i>

17:23.980 --> 17:26.900
Suga feels responsible every time I get blocked—

17:26.900 --> 17:29.820
It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks!

17:30.530 --> 17:33.030
Hey! Who's doing all that shouting?!

17:33.660 --> 17:35.830
Quiet in the halls!

20:05.390 --> 20:08.730
<i>When the going is tough and when the receives are all over the place,</i>

20:08.730 --> 20:11.110
<i>the ace is the one you trust.</i>

20:11.860 --> 20:14.820
<i>I know that. I know that, but...</i>

20:15.820 --> 20:20.990
<i>I can't set for Asahi if he isn't expecting it and force him to take on a three blockers.</i>

20:23.030 --> 20:28.710
<i>A spiker can only move in for a spike after the set is made.</i>

20:29.330 --> 20:32.790
<i>Please let me set for you one more time, Asahi.</i>

20:35.420 --> 20:39.590
<i>The set exists because a receive kept the ball in play.</i>

20:40.090 --> 20:44.640
<i>Don't you dare give up on a ball I keep in play!</i>

20:46.770 --> 20:50.520
<i>I'm not alone when I move in for a spike.</i>

20:52.900 --> 20:57.440
<i>Everyone else was doing their jobs, but I...</i>

20:57.860 --> 21:00.450
<i>It's only natural that you can't win all by yourself.</i>

21:00.450 --> 21:03.870
That<i> is why everyone calls you the ace.</i>

21:03.870 --> 21:06.330
<i>If there's a chance you might still like volleyball...</i>

21:06.330 --> 21:09.500
<i>So please, call for a set just one more time...</i>

21:09.500 --> 21:10.870
<i>ace!</i>

21:13.340 --> 21:14.000
Here!

21:14.920 --> 21:15.500
Shimada!

21:15.500 --> 21:19.470
Suga!

21:21.180 --> 21:22.970
One more!

21:27.390 --> 21:28.270
<i>Right.</i>

21:29.020 --> 21:30.480
<i>The ace is waiting.</i>

21:31.730 --> 21:33.190
<i>He's calling for the set.</i>

21:35.900 --> 21:38.530
<i>A high set, placed slightly in front of the net.</i>

21:39.530 --> 21:44.070
<i>Asahi's favorite set. The one I've given him so many times.</i>

21:44.990 --> 21:49.040
<i>I make this, the most simple set, with as much care as I can.</i>

21:49.370 --> 21:52.170
Are you backing the other team?

21:52.170 --> 21:53.750
We're gonna have to block him again.

21:53.750 --> 21:56.750
Obviously. There's no point cutting corners.

22:01.590 --> 22:03.640
<i>He's always got my back.</i>

22:04.390 --> 22:06.890
<i>He gives me the sets I find easiest to hit.</i>

22:07.640 --> 22:09.060
<i>I couldn't ask for more.</i>

22:09.640 --> 22:13.650
<i>Somewhere along the way, I'd forgotten the simplest, most natural thing.</i>

22:14.650 --> 22:15.520
<i>I'm...</i>

22:16.940 --> 22:19.530
<i>not fighting alone!</i>

22:21.030 --> 22:22.950
<i>Going through with the hit is what it means...</i>

22:38.250 --> 22:39.340
<i>to be the ace!</i>

22:41.920 --> 22:41.920
{ED}

22:52.560 --> 22:56.480
If I tell you this story,

22:56.480 --> 23:00.230
I wonder if I can explain to you

23:00.730 --> 23:04.700
my feelings

23:04.700 --> 23:07.700
and the distance between us

23:08.410 --> 23:16.370
Standing on an empty field

23:16.710 --> 23:25.300
I breathe out into the night air

23:25.300 --> 23:29.850
Countless times I swore that I would change

23:29.850 --> 23:33.850
I stumbled and fell a lot,

23:33.850 --> 23:37.810
but I swore I would laugh at the end

23:37.810 --> 23:41.730
and not let my tears go to waste

23:41.730 --> 23:45.740
There are so many dreams that can definitely come true

23:45.740 --> 23:49.740
I always sat somewhere, downcast, dejected, depressed,

23:49.740 --> 23:52.290
but still I decided I would fight,

23:52.290 --> 23:57.290
and not let all my frustration go to waste

23:57.290 --> 24:01.630
This is our revenge

24:19.060 --> 24:19.520
<i>This is—</i>

24:19.520 --> 24:21.560
<i>Yeah, yeah. You're gonna say it's sweat, right?</i>
