00:05.690 --> 00:08.320
Hey, Karasuno is swapping setters.

00:20.170 --> 00:21.420
Don't get down.

00:21.420 --> 00:23.210
We're just pausing to change the rhythm.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.090
I'm sorry.

00:27.170 --> 00:29.130
<i>Of course I'm worried about him.</i>

00:31.430 --> 00:34.260
<i>But what if both of them break at the same time?</i>

00:35.350 --> 00:37.930
I told you that I'd be the one to defeat you!

00:39.230 --> 00:41.350
Hinata, he'll get mad at you!

00:40.520 --> 00:42.860
You're not allowed to lose to anyone till then!

00:47.740 --> 00:50.150
The match isn't over,

00:50.150 --> 00:51.360
so I haven't lost yet.

00:53.570 --> 00:55.740
Really, he'll get mad at you.

00:56.830 --> 00:58.620
<i>Guess there was nothing to worry about.</i>

00:59.830 --> 01:02.460
Kageyama, I want you to watch closely from the sideline.

01:02.460 --> 01:04.000
And use the opportunity to calm down.

01:04.880 --> 01:06.920
Watch how your upperclassman plays.

01:07.960 --> 01:07.960
{OP}

01:12.590 --> 01:17.930
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

01:12.590 --> 01:17.930
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

01:22.600 --> 01:28.990
I take two deep breaths and calm my heart

01:29.240 --> 01:35.660
I take a step with my left foot to break the silence

01:36.370 --> 01:42.830
Get your nervousness in check and reign in your mind

01:43.170 --> 01:46.420
You have it in you

01:46.420 --> 01:49.210
You can cast out the demons

01:50.090 --> 01:56.350
Fate? Random chance? Questions? Answers? It's all one

01:56.350 --> 01:58.640
This is the sign

02:03.020 --> 02:04.810
Oh, yeah!

02:04.810 --> 02:07.440
The world is opening to us

02:07.440 --> 02:10.490
We pass the door,

02:10.490 --> 02:16.660
look straight ahead, and never look back

02:16.660 --> 02:18.580
Oh, yeah!

02:18.580 --> 02:24.290
I put my hand to my chest

02:24.290 --> 02:30.420
I can feel the proof that I exist

02:30.420 --> 02:34.550
It is my beating heart

02:38.010 --> 02:38.010
{Part A}

02:39.470 --> 02:40.260
Here!

02:40.930 --> 02:41.560
Here!

02:42.140 --> 02:42.850
Here!

02:43.480 --> 02:44.100
Here!

02:44.440 --> 02:45.600
Here!

02:47.060 --> 02:51.070

The Talented Upperclassman

02:47.060 --> 02:51.070
Episode Twenty-one: 
The Talented Upperclassman

02:47.230 --> 02:49.520
It's okay! We're gonna get that point!

02:52.490 --> 02:54.320
All right!

02:58.910 --> 02:59.780
What?

03:00.120 --> 03:02.830
Look at you. You're making that scary face.

03:02.830 --> 03:04.250
This is the face I was born with!

03:04.790 --> 03:08.460
You were so on edge, you went dead quiet.

03:09.460 --> 03:12.210
I could tell you were deep in thought about something,

03:12.210 --> 03:15.680
but it's hard to tell what you're thinking if you don't say anything.

03:17.390 --> 03:19.390
You mean I wasn't yelling at all?

03:19.390 --> 03:22.930
Yeah, more than any other match we've played so far.

03:22.930 --> 03:24.810
It was atrocious.

03:24.810 --> 03:29.150
<i>Shit. Have I lost it to the point he gets to lecture me?</i>

03:29.560 --> 03:32.730
Hey, about the setter Karasuno just put in the match...

03:32.730 --> 03:35.570
Number two... Hey, he's a third-year.

03:35.570 --> 03:36.860
Yikes!

03:36.860 --> 03:40.280
His place in the starting lineup was given to the new first-year prodigy!

03:40.660 --> 03:43.410
Daichi, you didn't yell as much as usual.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.330
The captain has to keep it together.

03:46.330 --> 03:47.670
Yeah, sorry.

03:47.670 --> 03:49.500
<i>Suga is the only one...</i>

03:49.500 --> 03:51.040
<i>...who can lecture Daichi.</i>

03:51.040 --> 03:51.540
Tsukishima.

03:54.130 --> 03:58.010
<i>It's hard for me to tell where Mr. Pleasant's talent lies,</i>

03:59.220 --> 04:03.970
<i>but from what I saw of his warmup,
 I gather that he's serious and meticulous.</i>

04:04.850 --> 04:10.020
Iwa, try to hit one straight down at number two's position, since he has a low block.

04:10.020 --> 04:10.770
Right.

04:15.440 --> 04:16.650
Nice receive!

04:17.070 --> 04:17.860
Tanaka!

04:18.400 --> 04:19.110
Come on in!

04:20.740 --> 04:21.700
Iwa!

04:21.700 --> 04:23.410
<i>Hit it...</i>

04:23.700 --> 04:26.120
<i>straight down at the low blocker!</i>

04:27.000 --> 04:27.710
Iwa!

04:33.590 --> 04:34.750
Shut out!

04:34.750 --> 04:36.960
Could they tell he was gonna hit it straight down?

04:36.960 --> 04:38.880
Yeah! That was a neat trick!

04:39.380 --> 04:43.350
They switched blocker positions
 right before the opponent spiked!

04:44.060 --> 04:47.350
Nice block, Tsukishima. Nice going!

04:47.350 --> 04:48.770
I can't take the credit.

04:49.730 --> 04:54.690
When we play against a tough team, they almost always target me because I'm a low blocker.

04:54.980 --> 04:57.690
I was pretty sure this match would be no exception.

04:58.110 --> 05:01.450
It's reassuring having someone tall beside me!

05:01.450 --> 05:04.160
No, I mean... Yes, sir.

05:04.620 --> 05:05.450
My bad.

05:05.080 --> 05:06.080
Shake it off!

05:05.450 --> 05:06.660
Sorry, Iwa.

05:06.660 --> 05:08.080
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

05:06.660 --> 05:08.080
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

05:08.370 --> 05:09.660
Boo-yah!

05:10.670 --> 05:11.500
Hinata?

05:12.710 --> 05:14.380
Tsukishima, give us a good serve!

05:16.550 --> 05:17.340
Here!

05:17.710 --> 05:19.590
Nice receive, Kunimi!

05:19.590 --> 05:21.800
Damn, he hit it back perfectly!

05:21.800 --> 05:22.800
Fast attack time?!

05:24.760 --> 05:25.680
A Quick?!

05:32.520 --> 05:34.520
Right on!

05:34.520 --> 05:36.690
Hinata, that was great!

05:36.690 --> 05:38.480
It was just like you said, Sugawara!

05:39.030 --> 05:44.910
<i>The next time they neatly return the ball to their setter, they'll probably do a quick attack in the center.</i>

05:44.910 --> 05:48.620
<i>But I want you to go slowly and delay your jump slightly.</i>

05:48.620 --> 05:49.450
Yup!

05:50.540 --> 05:54.710
<i>It was definitely frustrating to watch from the sideline,</i>

05:54.710 --> 05:57.920
<i>but I think I had a calmer perspective from out there.</i>

05:58.590 --> 06:02.130
<i>The time I spent not being playing served its purpose.</i>

06:02.470 --> 06:05.180
We've gotten a lot more psyched!

06:05.180 --> 06:06.100
Yeah.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.010
Don't worry.

06:08.890 --> 06:15.440
Are you worried that benching a prideful guy like Kageyama will make him get bent out of shape?

06:17.480 --> 06:18.940
He'll be fine.

06:18.940 --> 06:27.160
I believe that the factors behind Kageyama's strength
 and prowess are his pride and hunger for improvement.

06:27.160 --> 06:29.120
Tsukishima, serve up another one!

06:27.160 --> 06:29.120
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

06:27.160 --> 06:29.120
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

06:29.120 --> 06:30.700
One point to break it!

06:29.910 --> 06:32.710
<i>Let's see, what's the next attack?</i>

06:30.700 --> 06:31.660
Yeah!

06:31.660 --> 06:32.710
Bring it!

06:32.710 --> 06:33.830
Give us a good serve!

06:34.750 --> 06:39.460
I don't have the technical skill to make perfect sets like Kageyama,

06:39.460 --> 06:43.050
so I want to use signals to communicate our next attack.

06:48.050 --> 06:52.020
<i>He's the poor third-year who gave up his spot in the lineup to a first-year prodigy.</i>

06:52.520 --> 06:55.520
<i>That's what Suga looks like to a bystander. However...</i>

06:56.270 --> 06:58.230
<i>He's not saying "give me" or "send it"!</i>

06:58.650 --> 07:01.440
Tobio isn't setting, so there won't be any superhuman fast attacks!

07:01.440 --> 07:02.900
<i>Oh yeah!</i>

07:06.030 --> 07:10.490
<i>Suga has done non-stop simulations of standing on the court.</i>

07:10.910 --> 07:13.410
<i>He's Karasuno's other setter!</i>

07:15.670 --> 07:17.080
All right!

07:18.290 --> 07:22.920
<i>My technical skill and physical talent pale in comparison to Kageyama's,</i>

07:22.920 --> 07:25.300
<i>but I've watched our team a little longer than he has.</i>

07:26.470 --> 07:29.510
<i>I know I could never beat Aoba Jousai,</i>

07:30.720 --> 07:33.520
<i>but my teammates are good at what they do!</i>

07:35.230 --> 07:37.230
This point will turn it around!

07:37.230 --> 07:38.190
Yeah!

07:45.440 --> 07:46.860
Yes!

07:46.860 --> 07:48.570
Shake it off, Hinata.

07:48.570 --> 07:49.740
Hey, listen.

07:50.740 --> 07:51.660
You can do it!

07:51.660 --> 07:52.370
One point!

07:52.910 --> 07:54.580
<i>Shit. Now...</i>

07:58.080 --> 07:59.790
<i>it's Oikawa's serve.</i>

08:00.130 --> 08:01.250
Bring it!

08:02.670 --> 08:06.220
Olé!

08:06.550 --> 08:07.470
I've got it!

08:06.550 --> 08:07.470
Leave it to me!

08:09.300 --> 08:11.100
A campfire.

08:11.100 --> 08:13.180
He placed that perfectly.

08:13.180 --> 08:15.600
I'm sorry! I should've gone for it.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.690
I went in too close. I'm sorry!

08:19.060 --> 08:23.150
Olé!

08:25.030 --> 08:26.320
Front!

08:27.780 --> 08:29.240
All right!

08:29.240 --> 08:31.450
Aoba Jousai                       Karasuno

08:29.240 --> 08:31.450
Aoba Jousai                       Karasuno

08:29.700 --> 08:31.450
Set point for Seijou.

08:31.450 --> 08:35.450
Shit. How many points have been taken by that serve of his?!

08:36.750 --> 08:42.380
If there was an ideal way to play volleyball, 
it would be to take 25 points with serves alone.

08:38.410 --> 08:40.040
This will finish it!

08:40.040 --> 08:40.880
Yeah!

08:43.210 --> 08:45.710
The opponent is given no opportunity to attack.

08:46.380 --> 08:48.470
That's what a service ace is all about.

08:48.880 --> 08:50.470
I'll get it!

08:51.550 --> 08:52.680
Yes, sir!

08:57.020 --> 08:59.440
<i>Number ten as decoy with number five from the right.</i>

08:59.850 --> 09:02.310
<i>No, it's a back row attack!</i>

09:04.610 --> 09:06.150
Hanamaki, nice receive!

09:07.190 --> 09:09.450
Hinata, just spike it back!

09:09.450 --> 09:11.860
<i>I've never done that before.</i>

09:12.910 --> 09:14.070
You klutz!

09:14.450 --> 09:15.790
Would you shut up?!

09:20.160 --> 09:21.080
Hey, listen.

09:22.710 --> 09:24.540
About Seijou's fast attacks.

09:24.540 --> 09:28.800
I think they do theirs a little slower than we do.

09:28.800 --> 09:29.340
That's why...

09:30.050 --> 09:32.050
<i>Delay just a little more than usual.</i>

09:34.180 --> 09:34.930
<i>Then jump!</i>

09:36.600 --> 09:37.430
Back!

09:37.770 --> 09:39.140
Get back!

09:46.020 --> 09:47.730
It's out!

09:47.730 --> 09:51.450
Aoba Jousai                       Karasuno

09:47.730 --> 09:51.450
Aoba Jousai                       Karasuno

09:49.780 --> 09:51.450
Time to change sides. Let's go!

09:52.740 --> 09:54.030
That was real close, Hinata!

09:54.030 --> 09:55.320
We'll stop the next one!

09:55.870 --> 09:56.620
Yes, sir!

09:56.910 --> 09:58.790
<i>Shit, that was close!</i>

09:58.790 --> 10:00.580
<i>They matched our timing perfectly!</i>

10:01.500 --> 10:03.290
<i>Ever since number two was put in the match,</i>

10:04.120 --> 10:06.290
<i>everyone, including the small fry who moves only on instinct,</i>

10:07.040 --> 10:08.960
<i>is starting to think before they act.</i>

10:09.960 --> 10:13.550
<b>Rule the Court</b>

10:09.960 --> 10:13.550
<b>Rule the Court</b>

10:13.840 --> 10:15.260
Here.

10:15.720 --> 10:17.810
We're using the current lineup for the second set.

10:17.810 --> 10:18.470
Yessir!

10:19.890 --> 10:24.190
So, the biggest obstacle is obviously Oikawa's serve...

10:25.350 --> 10:27.650
so we're switching it up to make our defense more precise!

10:28.440 --> 10:30.610
Karasuno's attacks are way out there.

10:31.150 --> 10:34.570
Once we got ourselves in the mindset of number ten and Kageyama's fast attack,

10:35.320 --> 10:39.200
a normal fast attack like that really throws you off.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.410
You always end up paying too 
much attention to number ten.

10:41.410 --> 10:45.000
Iwa, don't strain the few brain cells you have! You'll hurt your head.

10:45.790 --> 10:49.500
<i>We only scrutinized Kageyama during the practice match.</i>

10:50.170 --> 10:53.510
<i>Who knew they had another solid setter on their team?</i>

10:53.510 --> 10:54.550
Sugawara!

10:54.550 --> 10:55.220
Yeah?

10:55.760 --> 10:57.050
Kindaichi's...

10:57.050 --> 10:59.050
Um, the turnip head's...

11:00.680 --> 11:05.270
Do you think number twelve's fast attack is a little on the slow side?

11:05.940 --> 11:06.900
I do!

11:07.560 --> 11:12.110
He kind of sits back and watches the ball and then goes for the hit.

11:12.740 --> 11:18.200
Putting a completely unknown playmaker like Sugawara in the match definitely throws off our opponent.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.080
He's different from Kageyama.

11:20.410 --> 11:21.410
Yeah.

11:21.410 --> 11:25.750
I was after the mentality that'd 
return the others to their senses,

11:25.750 --> 11:27.790
but I didn't expect this result.

11:28.540 --> 11:31.630
We can use this in more matches.

11:31.960 --> 11:32.880
Kageyama.

11:32.880 --> 11:33.590
Yes, sir.

11:34.050 --> 11:39.350
I know that unofficially we're kind of like rivals vying for the same position...

11:40.470 --> 11:42.640
but I want to have lots of play time too!

11:42.640 --> 11:44.140
Th-The same goes for me.

11:44.560 --> 11:47.350
But now that I'm actually on the court,

11:47.350 --> 11:51.570
I notice how tall our opponents are, and I became an immediate walking target for spikes.

11:51.570 --> 11:52.610
I get intimidated.

11:53.320 --> 11:55.570
This would've had me cowering before,

11:56.280 --> 11:58.240
but now you're waiting behind me.

11:59.030 --> 12:00.280
It's incredibly reassuring.

12:00.990 --> 12:03.080
The points scored while I'm playing

12:03.080 --> 12:04.750
and the points scored while you're playing

12:05.410 --> 12:07.290
are all points for Karasuno.

12:07.830 --> 12:10.170
I'll do my own absolute best,

12:10.170 --> 12:12.000
and you'll do your absolute best too.

12:12.750 --> 12:14.420
That's how we'll beat Seijou!

12:15.710 --> 12:16.670
Yessir!

12:17.220 --> 12:19.180
Are you down in the dumps, Mister Kageyama?

12:19.180 --> 12:20.340
Hardly!

12:20.340 --> 12:23.970
What?! I was feeling sorry for how lousy you must feel.

12:23.970 --> 12:27.230
Worry about yourself! What was that wimpy spike supposed to be?!

12:27.230 --> 12:29.350
Shut up! I'd never done one like that before!

12:29.850 --> 12:32.820
Once I'm back in the match, 
prepare to hit more of the same!

12:36.070 --> 12:38.530
Karasuno                       Aoba Jousai

12:36.070 --> 12:38.530
Karasuno                       Aoba Jousai

12:37.900 --> 12:38.530
Let's go!

12:38.950 --> 12:40.280
Yeah!

12:41.120 --> 12:41.160
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:41.160 --> 12:41.200

12:57.340 --> 12:58.970
Suga!

12:58.970 --> 13:01.590
Don't you start overthinking everything too!

13:01.590 --> 13:03.470
R-Right.

13:03.470 --> 13:05.970
We're going to take it back in the second set.

13:05.970 --> 13:10.230
We need to start by combating Oikawa's serve.

13:13.310 --> 13:16.650
Karasuno has moved up their rotation slightly for the second set.

13:16.650 --> 13:18.860
Seijou's is the same as the first set.

13:18.860 --> 13:22.030
Still, I wonder why they did that?

13:24.950 --> 13:26.580
All right!

13:26.580 --> 13:28.160
Nice, Tsukishima!

13:28.160 --> 13:28.950
Yes, sir.

13:29.250 --> 13:31.120
Give us another one of those!

13:31.120 --> 13:34.920
When I make a ball count, 
Sugawara showers me with compliments!

13:34.920 --> 13:36.050
Oh, really?

13:36.050 --> 13:39.800
He doesn't do it to be friendly.

13:39.800 --> 13:43.760
I think he talks to each spiker
 to measure their emotional state

13:43.760 --> 13:46.850
and to get a bearing on how well they feel on a given day.

13:48.470 --> 13:54.480
Tsukishima's case is special, because unlike the other third-years, Sugawara doesn't know that much about him.

13:56.070 --> 14:02.320
That face you're making screams, "Why should I inquire into the health of a guy like Tsukishima, you moron?"

14:02.320 --> 14:04.780
I-I wasn't...

14:05.320 --> 14:09.700
You know how you immediately adjust if Hinata finds the ball hard to hit?

14:09.700 --> 14:11.870
Yes. He likes to swing into thin air.

14:12.540 --> 14:17.710
But I think the others have their own technical skills to hit balls like that.

14:18.630 --> 14:20.590
It's funny coming from me,

14:21.300 --> 14:24.760
but I think our spikers are pretty advanced.

14:24.760 --> 14:27.600
I also think so.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.390
In that case,

14:29.140 --> 14:35.900
if they were all hitting at 100% capacity, don't you think they could compete with most blocks that got in their way?

14:39.820 --> 14:40.820
One point!

14:40.820 --> 14:43.530
It's the Great King's turn to serve!

14:47.240 --> 14:49.660
Serve receive W-Formation!

14:51.120 --> 14:52.620
When Oikawa serves,

14:53.120 --> 14:55.580
we'll switch up our defense to have the best receivers in back.

14:56.500 --> 14:59.340
When we're up against Oikawa's super-fast serve,

14:59.340 --> 15:02.300
a moment's hesitation or any confusion is fatal.

15:02.920 --> 15:08.260
So I'd like to tackle this by using Nishinoya and Sawamura, our two outstanding receivers.

15:08.970 --> 15:11.520
This is a formation we have never done in practice.

15:11.930 --> 15:13.270
But I think you can pull it off.

15:13.810 --> 15:14.890
We'll do it!

15:15.770 --> 15:17.440
That's so cool!

15:17.690 --> 15:20.070
This rotation of theirs in the second set...

15:20.070 --> 15:22.900
Did they move it slightly forward from the first set just so they could...

15:23.440 --> 15:27.660
They did it in order to align this formation to Oikawa's turn at serving!

15:28.490 --> 15:34.120
<i>Oikawa's serves dismembered us, and we lost five points to service aces in the first set alone.</i>

15:29.070 --> 15:30.620
One point breaks the cycle!

15:30.620 --> 15:31.790
Yessir!

15:31.790 --> 15:33.250
Bring it!

15:34.910 --> 15:38.250
<i>Until we combat that serve of his, we can't win against Seijou.</i>

15:39.670 --> 15:40.290
<i>Bring it!</i>

15:41.500 --> 15:45.590
Olé!

15:45.590 --> 15:46.340
Daichi!

15:52.510 --> 15:53.470
Yes!

15:53.810 --> 15:54.930
Nice receive!

15:55.980 --> 16:00.020
<i>Breaking the cycle of Oikawa's serve with one point is very significant.</i>

16:00.650 --> 16:03.030
<i>If we can score here, it'll count for a lot.</i>

16:03.360 --> 16:06.450
<i>This point is essential, 
and the pressure to make it is massive.</i>

16:06.820 --> 16:13.200
<i>I'll give it to the guy stopped the momentum of Oikawa's serves in the first set to get himself back on his feet.</i>

16:14.080 --> 16:14.660
Tanaka!

16:15.410 --> 16:17.250
<i>It's up to you!</i>

16:23.340 --> 16:23.710
All...

16:23.710 --> 16:25.590
...right!

16:26.840 --> 16:28.050
They stopped him!

16:29.430 --> 16:31.350
Way to go, Captain.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.430
Let's get a point!

16:34.430 --> 16:35.770
Tsukishima, give us a good serve!

16:35.770 --> 16:39.270
<i>I think our spikers are pretty advanced.</i>

16:39.650 --> 16:46.360
<i>If they were all hitting at 100% capacity, don't you think they could compete with most blocks that got in their way?</i>

16:51.070 --> 16:53.330
<i>Our morale is impeccable!</i>

16:53.830 --> 16:55.330
We need one point!

16:53.830 --> 16:57.870
<i>Seijou is our superior in experience and fundamental skill.</i>

16:55.330 --> 16:56.290
Yeah!

16:57.870 --> 17:00.290
<i>It'll get rough if they take the lead.</i>

17:01.040 --> 17:04.800
<i>But as long as we stay close, 
the momentum will eventually turn our way!</i>

17:08.760 --> 17:11.390
Okay, the field is equal in the second set.

17:08.760 --> 17:12.970
Karasuno                 Aoba Jousai

17:08.760 --> 17:12.970
Karasuno                 Aoba Jousai

17:09.260 --> 17:10.680
All right!

17:10.680 --> 17:12.090
Nice, Asahi!

17:11.390 --> 17:15.140
Yeah, but their blockers are all over them.

17:15.680 --> 17:18.890
Kindaichi, you're learning to read their attacks.

17:18.890 --> 17:19.980
Yessir!

17:21.230 --> 17:24.770
<i>Mr. Pleasant is definitely not a bad setter,</i>

17:24.770 --> 17:28.190
<i>but he always sets up textbook attacks,</i>

17:28.190 --> 17:30.320
<i>and they're never rushed.</i>

17:31.910 --> 17:34.870
Karasuno definitely has great 
fundamental offensive power,

17:34.870 --> 17:38.330
but we've played against several teams just like that.

17:39.120 --> 17:41.370
Now, let's leave them in our dust.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.670
Good!

17:46.340 --> 17:52.930
Y'know, I think the enemy spikers 
are learning to anticipate our setter.

17:52.930 --> 17:53.680
Yeah.

17:54.140 --> 17:54.890
Give us a good one!

17:54.890 --> 17:58.350
Olé!

18:02.440 --> 18:06.150
Karasuno                   Aoba Jousai

18:02.440 --> 18:06.150
Karasuno                   Aoba Jousai

18:03.690 --> 18:06.150
Back-to-back points for Seijou.

18:07.020 --> 18:09.610
Scoring on your opponent's serve is where momentum starts flowing.

18:10.030 --> 18:11.900
Don't let Seijou ride the wave!

18:12.650 --> 18:17.280
Karasuno has been using their left wing spikers a lot since they swapped their setter.

18:17.280 --> 18:20.790
That's because both of them are powerful.

18:20.790 --> 18:26.000
However, they're probably easier to deal with than number ten's bobbing and weaving.

18:22.290 --> 18:23.670
Let's score here!

18:28.380 --> 18:31.420
<i>I can feel a noose getting tighter around my neck.</i>

18:32.220 --> 18:33.970
<i>Yet I feel surprisingly calm.</i>

18:34.630 --> 18:37.390
<i>Impatience isn't interfering with my concentration yet.</i>

18:37.890 --> 18:41.600
<i>It's most likely because I have an obvious goal.</i>

18:42.100 --> 18:43.350
Go get that point!

18:44.520 --> 18:46.770
<i>I thought that being benched</i>

18:47.400 --> 18:50.690
<i>was proof that my usefulness was at an end.</i>

18:50.690 --> 18:54.070
<i>In reality, that probably was why I was benched back then.</i>

18:54.740 --> 18:55.450
<i>But...</i>

18:56.030 --> 18:57.950
Now, you're waiting behind me.

18:58.830 --> 19:00.240
It's incredibly reassuring.

19:01.410 --> 19:04.330
<i>Sugawara and I excel at different things,</i>

19:04.330 --> 19:06.170
<i>but I'm sure we share a common goal.</i>

19:07.710 --> 19:09.420
Left! Left!

19:10.590 --> 19:11.710
Cover it!

19:12.420 --> 19:13.380
I've got it!

19:16.510 --> 19:19.720
<i>I want to play.</i>

19:19.720 --> 19:21.430
<i>I want to play in the match!</i>

19:21.430 --> 19:23.310
<i>I want to stay here longer.</i>

19:23.310 --> 19:24.890
<i>I want to stay with these guys.</i>

19:25.440 --> 19:27.400
<i>Give me the stress of being on the court.</i>

19:27.940 --> 19:31.570
<i>Let me keep playing with these guys.</i>

19:31.900 --> 19:33.570
<i>Give me the breathlessness!</i>

19:33.570 --> 19:35.320
<i>Let me stay here.</i>

19:35.700 --> 19:37.280
<i>I want to touch the ball.</i>

19:37.280 --> 19:38.530
<i>I want to fight.</i>

19:38.530 --> 19:40.700
<i>I want to make the sets myself!</i>

19:41.240 --> 19:42.450
<i>As many times as it takes!</i>

19:42.910 --> 19:43.750
<i>In that case...</i>

19:44.540 --> 19:46.210
I'll do my own absolute best,

19:47.040 --> 19:49.130
and you'll do your absolute best too.

19:49.130 --> 19:49.670
That's how...

19:50.670 --> 19:52.920
<i>...we'll win the match that's in front of us!</i>

19:53.960 --> 19:55.340
Nice receive!

20:00.720 --> 20:01.890
Yes!

20:01.890 --> 20:03.890
Nice block, Kindaichi!

20:07.640 --> 20:09.230
I'm sorry, Hinata.

20:09.230 --> 20:11.770
I took too much time during that last fast attack.

20:11.770 --> 20:13.070
Uh, not at all.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.780
They've called for Karasuno's number nine.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.780
I think they're gonna switch setters.

20:20.570 --> 20:22.370
<i>I might have one more play left.</i>

20:23.160 --> 20:23.950
Suga.

20:26.040 --> 20:28.040
Give me the next ball.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.250
I'll make it count.

20:33.000 --> 20:33.840
Right!

20:34.500 --> 20:36.050
Give us a good one!

20:48.270 --> 20:49.810
All right!

20:49.810 --> 20:50.730
Whoa.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.660
I hate to say it, but...

21:10.330 --> 21:15.210
Hinata looks completely different when he's hitting your sets.

21:17.090 --> 21:18.470
I'm sure you're already aware of this,

21:19.880 --> 21:23.090
but everyone on our team is good at what they do.

21:23.930 --> 21:25.140
Yes, sir.

21:25.640 --> 21:26.390

Let's win this.

21:34.560 --> 21:35.570
Yes, sir.

21:35.900 --> 21:36.730
Good job.

21:36.730 --> 21:37.980
Good work.

21:37.980 --> 21:40.740
You played neck-and-neck against Seijou.

21:41.490 --> 21:43.070
That's because we have a good team.

21:43.490 --> 21:44.910
Still, you know.

21:44.910 --> 21:48.750
From here on in, we should probably try 
attacking the center line more aggressively.

21:51.670 --> 21:53.750
Yes, sir! Thank you!

21:55.460 --> 21:56.290
What the...

21:57.000 --> 22:02.220
The words "From here on in" are 
probably music to Sugawara's ears.

22:03.050 --> 22:07.930
<i>If everyone's working as best they can, 
I know we can take on a team like Seijou.</i>

22:08.680 --> 22:17.770
<i>But to get that vital step ahead, Karasuno really needs to have its ultimate decoy functioning at 100%.</i>

22:19.990 --> 22:21.070
<i>You're the only one...</i>

22:23.070 --> 22:25.700
<i>who can do that, Kageyama.</i>
