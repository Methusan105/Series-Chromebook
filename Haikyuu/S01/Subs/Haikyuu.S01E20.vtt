01:32.240 --> 01:38.660
I take a step with my left foot to break the silence

01:39.370 --> 01:45.840
Get your nervousness in check and reign in your mind

01:46.170 --> 01:49.380
You have it in you

01:49.380 --> 01:52.220
You can cast out the demons

01:53.090 --> 01:59.350
Fate? Random chance? Questions? Answers? It's all one

01:59.350 --> 02:01.640
This is the sign

02:05.980 --> 02:07.820
Oh, yeah!

02:07.820 --> 02:10.440
The world is opening to us

02:10.440 --> 02:13.490
We pass the door,

02:13.490 --> 02:19.660
look straight ahead, and never look back

02:19.660 --> 02:21.580
Oh, yeah!

02:21.580 --> 02:27.290
I put my hand to my chest

02:27.290 --> 02:33.420
I can feel the proof that I exist

02:33.420 --> 02:37.550
It is my beating heart

02:41.020 --> 02:41.020
{Part A}

02:41.020 --> 02:42.980
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

02:41.020 --> 02:42.980
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

02:43.100 --> 02:47.110
Episode Twenty: 
Oikawa Tooru is No Prodigy

02:43.100 --> 02:47.110
Episode Twenty: 
Oikawa Tooru is No Prodigy

02:43.350 --> 02:44.850
Kageyama, give us a good serve!

02:51.570 --> 02:52.070
<i>Crap!</i>

02:52.360 --> 02:53.150
It's out!

02:55.910 --> 02:58.410
He really sent it flying.

02:58.410 --> 03:00.370
What a great home run.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.370
<i>Shit.</i>

03:02.370 --> 03:03.540
Shake it off!

03:03.540 --> 03:04.660
I'm sorry!

03:05.750 --> 03:08.920
All right, maybe I should show you how it's done.

03:12.460 --> 03:16.380
Olé!

03:17.470 --> 03:18.550
He aimed it at Nishinoya?!

03:19.390 --> 03:20.260
<i>Straight on!</i>

03:20.600 --> 03:22.220
<i>No, it'll curve!</i>

03:25.690 --> 03:27.400
He took a serve from Oikawa!

03:27.400 --> 03:29.860
Karasuno's libero is incredible!

03:29.860 --> 03:32.320
Aw, they got it.

03:32.320 --> 03:34.820
Oh dear. That guy is good.

03:34.820 --> 03:36.400
Isn't that how it's done?!

03:36.400 --> 03:38.490
He retrieved it like any other ball!

03:39.280 --> 03:40.700
Send it to me!

03:40.700 --> 03:42.200
It's number ten!

03:46.370 --> 03:47.830
Yes!

03:46.830 --> 03:47.830
Good!

03:47.830 --> 03:50.460
Did you see what happened on the right?

03:50.460 --> 03:51.040
Yeah.

03:51.750 --> 03:55.920
Wasn't it Nekoma's setter who could distract with a glance?

03:56.220 --> 03:59.640
His superhuman sets should be illegal, darn it.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.470
I'm amazed Nishinoya got that up.

04:03.140 --> 04:07.730
But do you suppose Oikawa only accidentally sent the ball to Nishinoya?

04:07.730 --> 04:10.980
No, I think he aimed it at Nishinoya.

04:11.940 --> 04:17.570
If Nishinoya failed to receive the ball, 
it'd really demoralize the rest of the team.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.150
Well done!

04:13.150 --> 04:14.150
Thank you!

04:14.150 --> 04:15.820
Do another one just like that!

04:15.820 --> 04:16.610
Yes, sir!

04:17.950 --> 04:19.820
I think that's what he was after.

04:21.240 --> 04:22.700
<i>Thank goodness.</i>

04:22.700 --> 04:25.330
<i>You did good getting that one, Nishinoya.</i>

04:26.040 --> 04:29.960
I'm sorry. I keep getting suckered.

04:29.960 --> 04:33.500
We're against a team who had Date Tech at their mercy.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.000
Anyway, give it a minute.

04:35.670 --> 04:37.720
It should be any time now.

04:37.720 --> 04:39.840
The real matter is, Kindaichi.

04:40.430 --> 04:46.140
You must be plenty upset that your place as 
Kageyama's partner got taken over by that small fry.

04:46.140 --> 04:47.060
No, not really—

04:47.060 --> 04:48.600
It's okay, really.

04:48.600 --> 04:54.610
So what if Tobio thought of you as a useless servant in junior high?

04:54.610 --> 04:57.990
So what if Yours Truly can't do their trifling superhuman fast attack?

04:57.990 --> 05:01.780
We'll prove to him that you're amazing in your own right.

05:03.320 --> 05:04.530
You're good to jump.

05:04.530 --> 05:05.830
Y-Yes, sir!

05:06.990 --> 05:08.540
Tanaka, give us a good one!

05:08.540 --> 05:09.500
A good one!

05:10.000 --> 05:10.620
Watari!

05:10.620 --> 05:11.000
Got it!

05:11.000 --> 05:11.670
Nice receive!

05:12.120 --> 05:13.130
Center!

05:13.130 --> 05:14.460
<i>A Quick!</i>

05:19.010 --> 05:20.970
<b>Rule the Court</b>

05:19.010 --> 05:20.970
<b>Rule the Court</b>

05:25.180 --> 05:27.520
Is it just my imagination?

05:28.060 --> 05:32.480
I think their number twelve is jumping higher than he did in the practice match.

05:32.480 --> 05:35.440
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

05:32.480 --> 05:35.440
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

05:33.100 --> 05:34.610
Iwa, give us a nice serve!

05:37.400 --> 05:38.690
Sorry, cover it!

05:38.690 --> 05:39.360
Okay!

05:39.360 --> 05:41.070
Give me a set!

05:51.660 --> 05:52.620
Hmm?

05:55.460 --> 05:57.090
Teach! Hey, Teach!

05:57.800 --> 05:59.760
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

05:57.800 --> 05:59.760
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

05:59.760 --> 06:02.680
What? Seijou is already calling a timeout?

06:02.680 --> 06:03.590
Isn't it too early?

06:03.590 --> 06:06.720
It didn't seem like Karasuno was about to steal the momentum.

06:07.560 --> 06:10.180
I don't think I'm mistaken.

06:10.850 --> 06:12.890
It's "send" or "give."

06:13.520 --> 06:16.270
Have they already figured it out?

06:16.270 --> 06:18.110
Damn, they're fast.

06:18.570 --> 06:22.820
At first, I was like, "Wow, the small fry likes to shout as he dives in."

06:22.280 --> 06:23.780
Give it to me!

06:22.820 --> 06:26.070
It made me think maybe he forgot to pay his brain bill.

06:26.870 --> 06:31.040
Until I noticed that when they do their superhuman fast attack, he says "send it my way" or "send it over here."

06:31.040 --> 06:32.750
Phrases with the words "send it."

06:33.250 --> 06:35.500
And when they do normal fast attacks...

06:35.500 --> 06:37.170
They use the words "give me."

06:38.590 --> 06:41.840
However, being a decoy is the small fry's weapon.

06:41.840 --> 06:45.970
They want us to divert all of our attention to him.

06:45.970 --> 06:48.970
That's why we're going to adopt simple operating procedures.

06:49.510 --> 06:53.310
When we hear the words "send it," we'll mark only him.

06:53.310 --> 06:56.940
When he says "give me," we'll wait to see the set, and then jump.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.110
Okay?

06:58.110 --> 06:59.400
Yessir!

06:59.900 --> 07:07.030
Still, won't they realize that we've figured it out by taking a timeout so early in the match, when nothing is going on?

07:07.030 --> 07:08.490
Let them!

07:08.490 --> 07:10.700
That would actually be advantageous.

07:10.700 --> 07:13.370
If they realize that we're on to them...

07:13.870 --> 07:17.080
I'm almost certain it'll make Tobio lose his cool.

07:17.750 --> 07:21.090
Hey, why so serious? That's not like you!

07:21.090 --> 07:22.550
I beg to differ, Noya.

07:22.550 --> 07:24.970
This is how he normally looks.

07:25.420 --> 07:28.930
He makes this face when he dithers between milk and drinking yogurt.

07:28.930 --> 07:31.680
You... I... That isn't true!

07:32.220 --> 07:35.940
But, Noya, I really am amazed you managed to receive that serve!

07:35.940 --> 07:39.060
I've received that serve before back in junior high.

07:39.770 --> 07:42.150
It really was an amazing serve when it made it through,

07:42.610 --> 07:46.150
but it also missed a lot,
 and never had that degree of control.

07:46.860 --> 07:48.660
He must've really worked on that.

07:49.780 --> 07:54.250
I think it would take more than having one guy with impressive serves

07:54.250 --> 07:56.830
or one really good setter to stay in the top 4.

07:57.620 --> 07:59.460
Keep sharp or they'll take it away.

07:59.460 --> 08:00.420
Let's pull it together!

08:00.420 --> 08:01.790
Yeah!

08:03.380 --> 08:04.510
Bleagh!

08:04.510 --> 08:05.920
Right on!

08:04.510 --> 08:06.800
What is "bleagh" supposed to mean?!

08:05.920 --> 08:07.930
Never look down even if you mess up!

08:08.470 --> 08:10.930
Now let's set the trap.

08:10.930 --> 08:13.600
Kindaichi, you know where to aim, right?

08:13.600 --> 08:14.180
Yes, sir!

08:14.600 --> 08:15.140
One point!

08:15.140 --> 08:17.390
<i>Behind any powerful setup...</i>

08:17.730 --> 08:20.650
<i>is a good, initial receive.</i>

08:21.940 --> 08:23.690
Kindaichi, give us a good one!

08:26.030 --> 08:30.570
Weird. That serve didn't seem that powerful.

08:26.610 --> 08:28.450
I'm sorry, I'll get the next one!

08:28.450 --> 08:29.320
Shake it off!

08:35.790 --> 08:37.330
Yes!

08:37.330 --> 08:38.660
<i>It's hard to receive it.</i>

08:39.540 --> 08:44.090
<i>Are they aiming for where the setter moves from back row to front?</i>

08:44.420 --> 08:49.180
He's not serving like Oikawa, 
so why can't the opponent receive it?

08:49.180 --> 08:50.260
Ahem!

08:50.260 --> 08:52.180
Ah, yes. About that.

08:52.640 --> 08:52.890

08:52.640 --> 08:57.140

Back

08:52.930 --> 08:53.390

08:53.220 --> 08:55.560
When the setter is in the back row,

08:53.430 --> 08:53.890

Back

08:54.430 --> 08:54.890

Back

08:55.430 --> 08:55.890
Back

08:55.560 --> 09:00.980
he may not get closer to the front than the players in the front row until the serve is made.

08:55.930 --> 08:56.390
Back

08:56.430 --> 08:56.890

That's why he must move quickly to the net the moment the opponent serves the ball.

09:04.860 --> 09:04.900

09:04.900 --> 09:04.940

{=2}Back

09:05.110 --> 09:07.610
{=2}Back

09:08.190 --> 09:14.990
The receive is momentarily delayed where the 
players crisscross, so it's easy to make mistakes.

09:14.990 --> 09:17.950
But as long as they know where the serve is coming...

09:15.490 --> 09:17.120
Kindaichi, give us a good serve!

09:18.290 --> 09:19.000
Yes!

09:19.000 --> 09:20.660
...it's not impossible to receive.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.120
Nice receive!

09:24.040 --> 09:24.880
Yes!

09:24.880 --> 09:27.340
They really use their heads in this sport.

09:27.630 --> 09:29.970
Thank you, Mister!

09:29.970 --> 09:30.800
Mister?!

09:30.800 --> 09:32.300
Sure.

09:34.220 --> 09:36.350
Now Oikawa is in the front row.

09:36.350 --> 09:37.680
Number three!

09:36.810 --> 09:39.560
We'll have to be on guard for the dump again.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.560
Give us a good one!

09:39.850 --> 09:43.480
<i>Damn, this pressure is crazy.</i>

09:43.480 --> 09:45.480
<i>There's already a four point gap.</i>

09:45.480 --> 09:48.940
<i>We have two in the front row minus Hinata.</i>

09:48.940 --> 09:50.780
<i>We need to move our rotation!</i>

09:54.110 --> 09:55.490
Nice receive!

09:56.410 --> 09:57.330
<i>Setter dump!</i>

10:01.250 --> 10:05.080
Nothing's easier to prevent than a rushed setter dump.

10:05.710 --> 10:07.670
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

10:05.710 --> 10:07.670
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

10:09.130 --> 10:10.590
Hiyah!

10:10.590 --> 10:12.550
Yes!

10:12.880 --> 10:14.510
Boo-ya!

10:14.510 --> 10:16.890
Four more points, and we'll turn it around!

10:16.890 --> 10:18.140
Boo-boo-ya!

10:18.140 --> 10:19.720
You're so perky.

10:20.680 --> 10:23.440
That's what makes you so annoying.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.150
Give me a set!

10:28.610 --> 10:31.070
<i>When he says "give me," wait to see the set.</i>

10:32.650 --> 10:33.530
<i>He's jumping!</i>

10:37.280 --> 10:37.950
All right!

10:37.950 --> 10:39.740
<i>They must've figured it out.</i>

10:40.790 --> 10:41.830
Kageyama, give us a good one!

10:41.830 --> 10:42.500
One point!

10:43.910 --> 10:45.750
<i>This time, I won't miss!</i>

10:48.840 --> 10:50.420
It's too far forward!

10:53.840 --> 10:55.130
Go forward!

10:54.220 --> 10:56.300
Good, he adjusted for a soft hit!

10:57.760 --> 11:00.720
I won't let you get your chance that easily!

11:02.350 --> 11:04.140
Kageyama got the first touch!

11:04.140 --> 11:06.060
He won't be able to set!

11:06.520 --> 11:07.060
Tanaka!

11:08.060 --> 11:09.270
Shit.

11:09.770 --> 11:12.360
<i>He turned a tight situation into an opportunity.</i>

11:12.360 --> 11:15.200
<i>That's true strength under pressure.</i>

11:15.200 --> 11:17.910
<i>He didn't learn the sport like the rest.</i>

11:17.910 --> 11:19.280
Shake it off!

11:19.280 --> 11:20.410
One more point!

11:21.540 --> 11:24.750
Now the serve is back to Oikawa.

11:25.160 --> 11:30.500
Nothing feels more oppressive than when the usual big-talking, mood-maker goes silent.

11:32.300 --> 11:36.300
Olé!

11:32.710 --> 11:34.210
Nothing!

11:40.050 --> 11:40.100
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

11:40.100 --> 11:40.140
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

11:40.140 --> 11:40.180
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

11:40.140 --> 11:40.180
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

11:40.180 --> 11:40.220
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

11:40.180 --> 11:40.220
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

11:40.220 --> 11:40.260
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

11:40.220 --> 11:40.260
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

11:40.260 --> 11:47.020
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

11:40.260 --> 11:47.020
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

11:47.020 --> 11:47.020
{Part B}

11:47.100 --> 11:47.140
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

11:47.140 --> 11:47.190
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

11:47.190 --> 11:47.230
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

11:47.190 --> 11:47.230
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

11:47.230 --> 11:47.270
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

11:47.230 --> 11:47.270
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

11:47.270 --> 11:47.310
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

11:47.270 --> 11:47.310
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

11:47.310 --> 11:54.030
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

11:47.310 --> 11:54.030
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

11:56.860 --> 11:58.240
Yes!

11:58.660 --> 12:00.700
Sh-Shake it off! Go for the next point!

12:01.120 --> 12:05.160
<i>Flubbing consecutive serve receives can build up incredible pressure.</i>

12:05.540 --> 12:09.120
<i>You start by silencing the perky cueball.</i>

12:09.120 --> 12:10.960
<i>Next, the ace.</i>

12:10.960 --> 12:13.840
<i>Breaking the two left wing spikers so pivotal to their offense</i>

12:14.340 --> 12:16.550
<i>will render the excellent decoy meaningless.</i>

12:19.010 --> 12:20.140
That was fast!

12:19.390 --> 12:20.890
All right!

12:20.140 --> 12:22.550
Karasuno sure didn't wait to take a timeout.

12:22.550 --> 12:25.220
That's because Seijou has the momentum.

12:25.220 --> 12:28.230
They need to stop their momentum 
before it becomes impossible to reverse.

12:28.600 --> 12:31.230
I feel sorry for the guy they're targeting.

12:31.610 --> 12:32.730
Just keep it up!

12:32.730 --> 12:37.440
Even if you can't get it back to the setter, someone can always cover it as long as you keep it in the air.

12:37.440 --> 12:38.320
Yessir!

12:39.150 --> 12:41.030
By the way, Mister Kageyama.

12:41.570 --> 12:44.700
What was that last dump of yours supposed to be?

12:44.700 --> 12:46.160
I'm sorry, sir!

12:46.160 --> 12:47.330
I lost composure.

12:48.250 --> 12:49.920
As long as you're aware of it, that's fine.

12:50.540 --> 12:52.040
Dumps aren't the problem.

12:52.790 --> 12:57.510
It's beneficial to let our opponents be aware that we have a good variety of attacks.

12:58.130 --> 13:02.090
But dumps are nearly always stoppable once they're on to you.

13:02.760 --> 13:04.970
Choose when to use them carefully.

13:05.260 --> 13:06.310
Yessir.

13:06.310 --> 13:09.560
Next, don't forget who we're playing against.

13:09.560 --> 13:11.940
We're playing against Aoba Jousai, not Oikawa.

13:12.440 --> 13:15.900
Also, you're not playing them alone. We play as a team!

13:16.570 --> 13:17.480
Yessir.

13:19.360 --> 13:20.280
Give us a good one!

13:20.280 --> 13:21.360
One more point!

13:25.280 --> 13:27.790
Olé!

13:28.950 --> 13:29.540
It's up!

13:33.960 --> 13:35.920
<b>Rule the Court</b>

13:33.960 --> 13:35.920
<b>Rule the Court</b>

13:37.170 --> 13:38.510
Looking good!

13:38.510 --> 13:40.470
You're getting them up in the air, Tanaka!

13:40.470 --> 13:41.380
Yessir!

13:45.100 --> 13:45.800
Ryuu!

13:46.560 --> 13:47.640
Hinata, cover it!

13:47.640 --> 13:48.310
Yessir!

13:48.770 --> 13:49.270
Tanaka!

13:49.270 --> 13:50.730
It's number five!

13:53.940 --> 13:54.690
Sir!

13:54.690 --> 13:55.650
Right!

13:55.980 --> 13:59.150
Now we've used up both our timeouts.

13:59.150 --> 14:02.400
Stopping their momentum is the top priority.

14:02.990 --> 14:05.490
With volleyball, it's all about keeping the ball in play,

14:05.490 --> 14:12.710
so nothing feels worse than the guilt and loneliness that comes from repeatedly flubbing the vital serve receive.

14:12.710 --> 14:15.920
Then they add insult to injury by shutting him out.

14:16.340 --> 14:18.630
Is the guy with the crew cut gonna be okay?

14:19.670 --> 14:21.840
<i>Should I say something to him?</i>

14:22.470 --> 14:27.760
<i>Tanaka always encourages me when I start to cave in.</i>

14:28.890 --> 14:30.430
<i>I should say something.</i>

14:30.430 --> 14:30.930
Um...

14:41.320 --> 14:42.990
I apologize!

14:42.990 --> 14:45.450
Some things can't be avoided, Ryuu!

14:45.450 --> 14:48.660
That last set was real difficult, and you had a triple block on you. I failed to back—

14:48.660 --> 14:51.250
I failed to call for the set!

14:52.200 --> 14:54.160
I freaked out for a second. Dammit!

14:55.290 --> 14:57.710
I'll do a shitload of regretting once the match is done!

14:58.210 --> 15:00.380
I have no real redeeming qualities,

15:00.380 --> 15:04.170
so there's no use dragging down the team by caving over my own mistakes!

15:04.590 --> 15:06.010
I'll make it count the next time!

15:06.970 --> 15:09.890
The ability to say that is one heck of a redeeming quality!

15:09.890 --> 15:11.850
Yessir.

15:11.850 --> 15:15.100
It'll bounce off you by using your arms alone, so move your feet.

15:16.730 --> 15:18.860
Asahi, you should try to be more like Ryuu!

15:18.860 --> 15:20.610
I would if I could!

15:21.150 --> 15:24.070
You know, I noticed this during that last timeout,

15:24.070 --> 15:27.110
but isn't Oikawa acting a little weird?

15:27.110 --> 15:30.780
Yeah. He says he does that so he won't break his concentration.

15:30.780 --> 15:35.410
Most teams take timeouts to stop the momentum of those dangerous serves.

15:38.580 --> 15:40.710
Now, bring it!

15:40.710 --> 15:42.550
Oikawa, get another point!

15:42.550 --> 15:44.090
Give us a nice serve!

15:42.920 --> 15:46.010
<i>Damn, he has full concentration.</i>

15:46.720 --> 15:49.390
<i>The rest is up to you guys.</i>

15:50.220 --> 15:54.020
Olé!

15:56.100 --> 15:59.230
<i>If it bounces off me at a weird angle, it's all over! I have to receive it!</i>

16:00.230 --> 16:02.570
That could've hit him in face!

16:02.570 --> 16:04.820
<i>Shit, it's falling!</i>

16:08.740 --> 16:09.740
They sent it back!

16:09.740 --> 16:11.330
And in the best possible spot.

16:11.330 --> 16:11.950
Watacchi!

16:12.240 --> 16:13.450
Yes, sir! Hanamaki!

16:17.160 --> 16:18.210
Nice receive!

16:18.210 --> 16:19.370
Sorry! Cover it!

16:19.370 --> 16:21.590
Left!

16:22.000 --> 16:22.920
Tanaka!

16:23.800 --> 16:27.050
<i>It's not as though he doesn't make mistakes.</i>

16:27.050 --> 16:29.220
<i>And he's sensitive to jeers.</i>

16:29.840 --> 16:35.100
<i>But not only is he the most powerful player second to Asahi,</i>

16:35.430 --> 16:40.350
<i>he has the mental fortitude to maintain his performance when he's at the brink.</i>

16:42.810 --> 16:44.320
<i>It's indisputable.</i>

16:47.240 --> 16:48.900
<i>He has the makings of an ace.</i>

16:51.200 --> 16:54.160
Ooh! The short-haired guy from Karasuno did it for himself!

16:54.580 --> 16:56.620
He took the momentum that Oikawa stole from them...

16:56.910 --> 16:58.790
Yes!

16:58.790 --> 16:59.580
...and stopped it!

16:59.580 --> 17:00.250
Tanaka!

17:00.250 --> 17:04.040
Aw, I was still good for a few more points.

17:00.250 --> 17:00.750
Ryuu!

17:00.750 --> 17:01.330
Tanaka!

17:01.330 --> 17:01.830
Nice!

17:01.830 --> 17:04.040
Guys, thanks for the awesome backup!

17:04.040 --> 17:07.510
Whoa, that was my clearest look at a block ever!

17:08.220 --> 17:13.510
There are times I can see the opponents' block real clear in midair, like in slow motion.

17:14.010 --> 17:16.930
Almost like light is shining through it.

17:17.720 --> 17:19.640
Tanaka, that's so cool!

17:20.600 --> 17:21.810
Because I'm your upperclassman!

17:21.810 --> 17:23.020
Tanaka, serve!

17:23.020 --> 17:23.440
Yes, sir.

17:24.650 --> 17:25.980
<i>The momentum has been stopped.</i>

17:26.900 --> 17:29.070
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

17:26.900 --> 17:29.070
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

17:27.480 --> 17:29.070
<i>It's still early in the match.</i>

17:30.110 --> 17:31.700
<i>We can still catch up.</i>

17:35.030 --> 17:36.290
Nice job getting a hand on it!

17:35.490 --> 17:36.990
We have a chance here!

17:37.830 --> 17:39.040
Send it my way!

17:42.670 --> 17:44.080
All right!

17:44.080 --> 17:46.880
<i>He's too fast even when we know he's coming!</i>

17:46.880 --> 17:48.170
Hey, you!

17:48.170 --> 17:51.260
You'd better not tell me you still can't beat his sets.

17:51.260 --> 17:53.720
You mean Tobio's? Of course I can't beat him.

17:53.720 --> 17:57.060
I can't do pinpoint sets like he can.

17:57.060 --> 17:57.930
Don't get mad!

17:58.390 --> 18:00.350
Tanaka, give us a good serve!

17:58.640 --> 18:04.150
Sure, I can't beat his talent, but I know I can produce the sets you all hit the best.

18:05.360 --> 18:07.860
So I'm as good of a setter as he is.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.990
<i>It got in above the block again.</i>

18:14.990 --> 18:17.620
<i>Don't look so surprised.</i>

18:17.620 --> 18:21.710
<i>This has always been Kindaichi's optimum striking point.</i>

18:22.370 --> 18:23.580
Forward!

18:22.370 --> 18:25.580
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

18:22.370 --> 18:25.580
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

18:24.250 --> 18:25.580
<i>A seven point gap.</i>

18:25.580 --> 18:26.710
Nice receive!

18:26.000 --> 18:27.790
<i>We need to stop their momentum!</i>

18:26.710 --> 18:27.790
Send it my way!

18:31.260 --> 18:34.130
He's looking sharper than ever!

18:35.140 --> 18:36.390
<i>Shit.</i>

18:35.640 --> 18:37.800
I'm sorry, I was a little too late.

18:36.390 --> 18:39.140
<i>A double block. They're keeping up with us.</i>

18:37.800 --> 18:39.140
That was close!

18:39.140 --> 18:41.020
Shake it off! You'll get the next one.

18:39.140 --> 18:42.680
<i>If they stop us now, they'll have the momentum again.</i>

18:41.020 --> 18:42.680
Yes, sir. I'll do my best!

18:42.680 --> 18:44.640
<i>I need to lose one blocker.</i>

18:45.560 --> 18:51.070
<i>When I was in my second year of high school,
 I heard the nickname of a brilliant player in junior high.</i>

18:51.610 --> 18:53.820
<i>"The King of the Court."</i>

18:53.820 --> 18:56.530
<i>I thought, wow, what a prestigious nickname.</i>

18:56.820 --> 19:00.490
<i>But once I watched him play,
 I knew it meant something else.</i>

19:01.080 --> 19:03.750
<i>He has the power. He has the talent.</i>

19:03.750 --> 19:08.000
<i>He wants to win more than anyone else I know.</i>

19:08.000 --> 19:10.090
<i>Those elements make Tobio tough,</i>

19:10.460 --> 19:14.260
<i>but they're also a weakness.</i>

19:15.130 --> 19:18.550
<i>You always try to do everything by yourself, Tobio.</i>

19:19.300 --> 19:21.810
<i>And it's only been about two months.</i>

19:22.470 --> 19:25.140
<i>It takes longer than that to cure a bad habit.</i>

19:26.140 --> 19:27.600
Hanamaki, nice spike!

19:27.600 --> 19:28.520
Nice!

19:28.520 --> 19:29.940
Boo-ya!

19:29.940 --> 19:30.820
Hinata!

19:32.070 --> 19:34.780
You know the signals we talked about? It's time to change our strategy.

19:35.530 --> 19:37.360
Do you mean we're using the new ones?

19:37.360 --> 19:38.120
Cover it!

19:39.030 --> 19:40.410
Matsukawa, nice block!

19:42.120 --> 19:43.330
I've got it!

19:43.660 --> 19:45.000
One more time!

19:45.000 --> 19:50.420
Hey, is it just me, or is Karasuno's offense gradually speeding up?

19:51.170 --> 19:53.670
<i>I don't like this acceleration.</i>

19:53.670 --> 19:56.260
<i>We've already used up our timeouts.</i>

19:56.260 --> 19:58.640
Go slow! Don't lose your cool!

19:59.260 --> 20:00.930
It's a collective speed trance.

20:01.680 --> 20:08.020
They want to dodge the blockers so badly, they accidentally prioritize speed over ease and accuracy.

20:08.650 --> 20:11.440
Subconsciously and ever so gradually

20:12.190 --> 20:15.940
it steadily leads to bigger miscalculations.

20:16.450 --> 20:19.160
<i>Tobio, you're a prodigy.</i>

20:19.990 --> 20:23.790
<i>You're the only one who can pull off those attacks with the small fry.</i>

20:24.450 --> 20:26.830
<i>But how about the rest?</i>

20:26.830 --> 20:30.380
<i>Don't you think if you set it more slowly to your number three,</i>

20:30.380 --> 20:33.880
<i>he would have the caliber to compete with our blockers?</i>

20:34.840 --> 20:38.930
<i>Does Four-eyes truly trust your sets when he hits that ball?</i>

20:40.090 --> 20:42.720
<i>All spikers are unique.</i>

20:42.720 --> 20:46.180
<i>Only a true setter can bring out all their strengths...</i>

20:48.310 --> 20:49.440
<i>completely.</i>

20:51.400 --> 20:53.650
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

20:51.400 --> 20:53.650
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

20:53.980 --> 20:55.190
<i>It's no good.</i>

20:55.190 --> 20:57.110
<i>The gap isn't shrinking.</i>

20:57.820 --> 21:00.360
<i>I need to do something, anything!</i>

21:00.360 --> 21:01.320
<i>It's over the net!</i>

21:01.320 --> 21:02.780
Push it back, Kageyama!

21:22.050 --> 21:25.810
It's like Kageyama isn't himself somehow.

21:31.940 --> 21:33.480
Nice receive!

21:33.810 --> 21:35.440
<i>I'll be damned if I'll lose!</i>

21:35.440 --> 21:36.940
<i>I refuse to lose!</i>

21:37.650 --> 21:39.650
<i>I have to win and stay on the court!</i>

21:45.030 --> 21:46.370
Asahi, nice backup!

21:46.370 --> 21:47.200
We have a chance here!

21:47.790 --> 21:51.160
<i>Oikawa is talented, and he puts in a good effort.</i>

21:51.870 --> 21:56.920
<i>But when you compare him to a whiz like Kageyama, two years his junior...</i>

21:57.380 --> 22:00.880
<i>Oikawa is a class act, but he is no prodigy.</i>

22:01.550 --> 22:07.100
<i>Yet, I can still say with certainty, 
the better setter of the two right now...</i>

22:07.930 --> 22:09.430
<i>is Oikawa.</i>

22:10.930 --> 22:14.150
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

22:10.930 --> 22:14.150
