Kitagawa First

00:06.030 --> 00:09.740
<i>My first and last official match of junior high.</i>

00:09.740 --> 00:11.660
<i>My team was creamed.</i>

00:12.450 --> 00:14.950
<i>Our opponent was the King of the Court.</i>

00:14.950 --> 00:17.790
<i>I swear I'll challenge him to a revenge match!</i>

00:18.710 --> 00:22.750
<i>I made up my mind, and proceeded to Karasuno High School.</i>

00:23.590 --> 00:24.380

{OP}

00:38.640 --> 00:40.850
The heat flickers

00:40.850 --> 00:43.190
Sweat glitters on my skin

00:43.190 --> 00:48.070
Shouts echo and shoulders hit

00:48.070 --> 00:52.740
We asked the sky through the open window

01:00.580 --> 01:03.170
The chance is there

01:03.580 --> 01:05.170
Come on, come on, come on

01:05.170 --> 01:07.340
Do it together

01:09.260 --> 01:13.850
Everybody always wants to stand there,

01:13.850 --> 01:18.560
make mistakes, get angry, and struggle

01:18.560 --> 01:19.890
We'll never give up

01:19.890 --> 01:23.350
We don't want it to end

01:23.350 --> 01:28.860
I will continue on with my imagination

01:30.360 --> 01:35.070
I want to struggle and fall and become stronger

01:35.070 --> 01:39.830
I want to persevere, stand back up, do it again,

01:39.830 --> 01:41.120
and never give up

01:41.120 --> 01:44.420
Let me run

01:44.420 --> 01:50.260
I will run to where my imagination leads me

02:04.350 --> 02:08.360
Episode Two: 
Karasuno High School Volleyball Team

02:07.440 --> 02:08.570
<i>Why?</i>

02:08.570 --> 02:10.690
<i>Why is this guy at Karasuno?</i>

02:11.530 --> 02:14.740
<i>No, maybe it's someone else?</i>

02:14.740 --> 02:16.740
What did you come here for?

02:16.740 --> 02:18.870
It isn't as easy as it sounds!

02:18.870 --> 02:20.830
I'll be the one still standing on the court at the end!

02:20.830 --> 02:23.250
What have you been doing for the last three years?!

02:23.250 --> 02:25.790
<i>No, there's no doubt! It's him!</i>

02:26.380 --> 02:27.790
<i>Kageyama Tobio!</i>

02:28.960 --> 02:30.420
You're that guy from last year.

02:30.880 --> 02:32.510
Whatever your name is.

02:32.510 --> 02:35.680
M-My name is Hinata Shouyou.

02:35.680 --> 02:39.890
I doubt you would even remember a team you beat in the first round!

02:38.930 --> 02:40.810
I remember you very well.

02:42.020 --> 02:45.940
<i>This guy has outstanding reflexes, jumping ability, and speed.</i>

02:46.480 --> 02:50.570
<i>But he doesn't take advantage of these abilities at all.</i>

02:50.570 --> 02:52.780
What? You wanna fight?

02:52.780 --> 02:54.400
You klutzy piece of shit!

02:55.820 --> 02:58.200
D-Don't you make fun of me!

02:58.200 --> 03:00.620
I know I got clobbered in that match,

03:01.040 --> 03:02.250
but I won't lose next time!

03:06.040 --> 03:09.590
That's what I came here prepared to do,
 so why are you here?!

03:09.590 --> 03:11.920
How can I kick your ass if we're on the same team?!

03:11.920 --> 03:14.880
There are way more successful schools to choose from!

03:14.880 --> 03:16.550
Why didn't you go to one of those instead?!

03:18.220 --> 03:20.510
I applied to the best school in the prefecture.

03:22.850 --> 03:23.640
But I didn't make it in.

03:25.770 --> 03:26.640
You didn't make it?

03:27.520 --> 03:29.520
But you're the King of the Court!

03:30.570 --> 03:31.820
Don't...

03:32.440 --> 03:33.150
call me that!

03:33.530 --> 03:34.240
Huh?

03:35.360 --> 03:38.700
Who knew that the setter from
 Kitagawa First would choose us?

03:39.120 --> 03:41.660
But the guy is cocky. I just know it.

03:41.660 --> 03:45.750
Not again. Would you stop trying to intimidate everyone you see?

03:45.750 --> 03:48.120
I-I would never do such a thing.

03:48.670 --> 03:49.540
Hello!

03:55.630 --> 03:59.260
Hey, hey, hey. What do you guys think—

03:59.260 --> 04:00.300
Are you Kageyama?

04:00.300 --> 04:01.600
Hello.

04:01.600 --> 04:02.640
Glad to see you!

04:02.640 --> 04:03.760
He's pretty darned tall.

04:03.760 --> 04:06.060
First impression are key, Suga!

04:06.060 --> 04:09.100
Blast him with your upperclassman prestige!

04:09.100 --> 04:11.400
Tanaka, stop making faces.

04:11.400 --> 04:14.150
<i>Kageyama is slightly taller than them,</i>

04:14.150 --> 04:17.650
<i>but these high schoolers are still kind of huge.</i>

04:17.650 --> 04:21.030
<i>That's right! I'm here, at Karasuno.</i>

04:21.030 --> 04:21.780
<i>Okay...</i>

04:21.780 --> 04:22.580
Hello!

04:22.580 --> 04:23.700
How tall are you?

04:23.700 --> 04:24.950
180 cm.

04:24.950 --> 04:25.620
Oh...

04:25.620 --> 04:26.950
You're a cocky one, aren't you?

04:26.950 --> 04:28.210
Hello!

04:30.000 --> 04:31.170
Huh?

04:31.580 --> 04:33.250
Hey, it's you!

04:33.250 --> 04:34.710
The shorty who wore number one!

04:36.260 --> 04:41.680
Do you mean the other applicant named Hinata... is you?

04:42.720 --> 04:45.720
I'm just a little surprised.

04:46.600 --> 04:47.390
I see.

04:47.890 --> 04:50.190
So both of you chose Karasuno!

04:50.190 --> 04:51.150
Um...

04:51.440 --> 04:54.610
We saw you guys play last year.

04:54.610 --> 04:57.820
You're small and you were all over the place, but you had fight!

04:58.440 --> 04:59.610
Thank you!

04:59.610 --> 05:01.530
You can jump pretty high too.

05:01.530 --> 05:04.330
But you really haven't grown much at all.

05:06.240 --> 05:09.000
I may be small, but I can jump!

05:09.290 --> 05:11.710
I'll become the ace of Karasuno, you'll see!

05:12.670 --> 05:13.920
Come on.

05:14.290 --> 05:16.840
You only just got here and you're already claiming ace position?

05:16.840 --> 05:18.760
You've got some balls!

05:18.760 --> 05:22.180
What's wrong with having high aspirations? Right?

05:23.220 --> 05:24.680
I-I'll give it my best!

05:24.680 --> 05:30.430
Now that you've announced that you're gonna be the ace, you better have improved.

05:30.810 --> 05:34.190
Keep dragging your feet, 
and you'll waste another three years.

05:35.020 --> 05:36.230
Excuse me?

05:39.490 --> 05:42.450
Why do you say things like that, Kageyama?

05:42.450 --> 05:44.030
I did try my best...

05:44.030 --> 05:45.950
Yukigaoka                  Kitagawa First

05:44.030 --> 05:45.950
Yukigaoka                  Kitagawa First

05:45.030 --> 05:45.950
<i>I did.</i>

05:49.500 --> 05:53.750
But don't make it sound like 
everything I've done is for nothing!

05:57.170 --> 06:00.800
Look, you guys. You do realize that you're not enemies anymore, right?

06:00.800 --> 06:02.380
Volleyball brings people together—

06:02.380 --> 06:04.010
I want you to play me!

06:04.010 --> 06:06.430
Hey, Daichi is still talking to you!

06:06.430 --> 06:07.760
Play you at what?

06:07.760 --> 06:09.640
At volleyball! Duh!

06:09.640 --> 06:12.020
How do you propose we play volleyball one-on-one?

06:12.640 --> 06:13.850
Doing passes and stuff.

06:13.850 --> 06:16.310
How do you win or lose at passing?

06:16.310 --> 06:17.770
Listen, damn it!

06:17.770 --> 06:19.780
You're getting noisy, volleyball team!

06:22.530 --> 06:23.820
Ugh! The veep!

06:23.820 --> 06:25.030
Principal!

06:25.030 --> 06:25.820
Vice Principal!

06:25.820 --> 06:27.990
You're not quarreling, I trust?

06:27.990 --> 06:31.830
Not at all! This is what they call friendly rivalry. Right, guys?

06:31.830 --> 06:36.250
We gotta behave ourselves,
 'cause the veep wants us to misbehave.

06:35.420 --> 06:38.250
Serve me the ball! I'll receive whatever you hit!

06:38.250 --> 06:39.000
Hey!

06:39.420 --> 06:43.090
I only received one serve from you last year.

06:43.090 --> 06:44.720
<i>With my face.</i>

06:45.300 --> 06:48.390
I've been practicing with all kinds of people!

06:50.060 --> 06:52.180
I'm not the same guy I was last year!

06:53.810 --> 06:56.730
Not the same as last year, huh?

07:00.860 --> 07:03.150
I'm not the same guy I was last year either.

07:03.150 --> 07:04.700
Now, now, you guys.

07:04.700 --> 07:06.570
Enough freewheeling.

07:06.570 --> 07:08.370
Are those first-years?

07:08.660 --> 07:10.530
<i>Chill out. Don't let him faze you.</i>

07:10.530 --> 07:13.830
<i>I've trained like crazy with the old ladies' serves!</i>

07:14.750 --> 07:15.750
Here goes.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.210
<i>A jump serve?!</i>

07:18.210 --> 07:19.500
<i>He only did normal ones last year!</i>

07:27.550 --> 07:29.850
I dunno if <i>I</i> could get that one either.

07:27.890 --> 07:32.520
<i>No girls' or old ladies' teams serve like this.</i>

07:32.810 --> 07:36.060
How is that not the same as last year?

07:38.850 --> 07:40.270
One more.

07:40.270 --> 07:41.940
Hey, knock that off.

07:41.940 --> 07:44.990
It's a problem that they won't take orders from their team captain.

07:50.160 --> 07:51.080
<i>Fast reflexes!</i>

07:51.450 --> 07:53.450
<i>He's facing the ball straight-on, ready to—</i>

07:53.910 --> 07:55.790
If this continues—

08:06.220 --> 08:07.880
That was a toupée?

08:07.880 --> 08:09.510
You didn't notice?

08:09.510 --> 08:11.760
We all noticed it during the entrance ceremony.

08:12.390 --> 08:15.060
You guys! Shut up!

08:15.060 --> 08:16.890
You shut up, Tanaka!

08:16.890 --> 08:19.480
Sawamura, can I have a moment?

08:22.770 --> 08:25.690
Fortunately, we have the benefit of the doubt.

08:25.690 --> 08:26.860
No apologies necessary.

08:27.860 --> 08:30.320
But I want you to pretend you saw nothing.

08:32.950 --> 08:33.740
You two, however...

08:33.740 --> 08:35.910
It's your fault for not receiving it properly, you klutz.

08:35.910 --> 08:37.460
"Not the same as last year"?

08:37.460 --> 08:38.500
Don't make me laugh.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.290
You're such a let-down. You suck!

08:40.290 --> 08:42.500
You talk too much.

08:41.750 --> 08:42.500
Hey.

08:43.420 --> 08:45.550
I'd like you to listen to me.

08:46.050 --> 08:49.220
I don't know what motivated you to come to Karasuno.

08:49.220 --> 08:51.590
But you came here to win, didn't you?

08:51.590 --> 08:52.220
Yes!

08:52.220 --> 08:53.010
Of course.

08:53.390 --> 08:57.390
Karasuno's team could compete with the best up until a few years ago.

08:58.180 --> 09:01.020
It happened only once, but they went to nationals.

09:01.020 --> 09:03.690
But now, we're only in the top eight in the prefecture.

09:03.690 --> 09:06.110
We are neither weak nor strong.

09:06.110 --> 09:09.570
Other schools call us the fallen champs.

09:10.030 --> 09:11.410
The clipped crows.

09:11.950 --> 09:16.330
I remember well when Karasuno competed in the spring national tournament.

09:17.080 --> 09:20.960
I'd sometimes walk right past students from the nearby Karasuno High School

09:21.420 --> 09:25.500
who were competing against the country's best teams in a huge gymnasium in Tokyo.

09:26.380 --> 09:27.920
It gave me goosebumps.

09:33.220 --> 09:35.350
We're going there one more time!

09:46.860 --> 09:50.110
<i>We're going to the same court as the Little Giant!</i>

09:51.280 --> 09:52.490
There are plenty

09:53.280 --> 09:57.370
of high schools that treat going to nationals like a tentative dream.

09:57.370 --> 09:58.540
You bas—I mean, you...

09:58.540 --> 09:59.950
There's no need to worry.

10:00.290 --> 10:01.910
I'm serious about going.

10:02.920 --> 10:06.170
We need a united team to accomplish that.

10:06.670 --> 10:09.670
And that's also why we don't want the Vice Principal's watching our every move.

10:10.170 --> 10:15.430
Look, it isn't as though I'm telling you to be friends.

10:16.180 --> 10:20.470
In junior high, you may've been adversaries separated by a net,

10:21.310 --> 10:26.110
but I want you go get it into your heads that 
you'll both be on the same side of the net now.

10:27.110 --> 10:28.190
Is that understood?

10:29.980 --> 10:32.240
I don't care how good you are.

10:32.740 --> 10:35.240
Or how hard you intend to play.

10:35.700 --> 10:40.040
Anyone who causes trouble for the team with petty rivalry...

10:41.950 --> 10:43.210
is out!

10:43.830 --> 10:46.670
I will not allow you to participate in practice

10:46.670 --> 10:49.090
until you can demonstrate some team awareness!

11:04.100 --> 11:04.140
<b><b>Haikyuu !!</b></b>

11:04.140 --> 11:04.180

11:18.490 --> 11:20.490
What?!

11:21.870 --> 11:24.080
What's team awareness?!

11:24.080 --> 11:25.040
How is it done?!

11:25.040 --> 11:25.960
How should I know?!

11:25.960 --> 11:29.210
P-Please let me in! Please let me play volleyball!

11:29.210 --> 11:32.550
I'll get along with Kageyama, I swear!

11:32.550 --> 11:33.760
Please!

11:33.760 --> 11:35.220
You sure about this, Daichi?

11:35.220 --> 11:36.630
We need more members.

11:37.010 --> 11:40.430
Besides, only time can make a team.

11:40.430 --> 11:42.510
I know that! However...

11:42.510 --> 11:43.890
Hey! Outta the way!

11:44.390 --> 11:45.890
I'm sorry for my behavior!

11:45.890 --> 11:47.770
I'll play alongside him!

11:47.770 --> 11:49.770
Please let me be on the team!

11:54.320 --> 11:55.820
Be honest.

12:03.830 --> 12:07.500
If I'm stuck working with him in a match,

12:07.500 --> 12:12.170
I'd rather do every receive, spike, and set by myself.

12:12.170 --> 12:13.590
What the hell is with you?!

12:15.710 --> 12:18.800
Why are you actually being honest with me?

12:18.800 --> 12:20.800
I'm good with that kind of thing.

12:20.800 --> 12:21.800
Still,

12:22.390 --> 12:29.020
in volleyball, you can't drop, carry, or touch the ball twice in a row.

12:29.020 --> 12:31.150
How do you plan to play alone?

12:35.360 --> 12:36.940
What's your damage?

12:36.940 --> 12:38.570
Are you actually retarded or something?

12:42.030 --> 12:42.910
Right!

12:44.830 --> 12:46.830
Tanaka, follow up when you block!

12:46.830 --> 12:47.580
Yes, sir!

12:48.410 --> 12:51.130
There's a court and a ball within reach.

12:51.130 --> 12:52.670
I hate being in the doghouse.

12:52.670 --> 12:55.550
Dammit! There's no time for this!

12:55.550 --> 12:57.300
I'm gonna get inside!

12:57.300 --> 12:59.550
Did you find your team awareness?

13:00.010 --> 13:01.470
I'm a force to be reckoned with!

13:01.760 --> 13:04.810
That's reason enough to let me join their team!

13:05.470 --> 13:06.810
Spoken like a true king—

13:07.520 --> 13:09.140
Anyway, what're you going to do?

13:09.140 --> 13:12.060
We'll challenge them to a two-on-two match.

13:12.060 --> 13:13.810
If we win, we get to join.

13:13.810 --> 13:17.030
If we work together, we'll look like teammates, like it or not.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.150
That will speed things up.

13:18.150 --> 13:20.110
Against the upperclassmen, you mean?

13:20.450 --> 13:22.450
What if we lose?

13:22.450 --> 13:23.780
We can't lose.

13:23.780 --> 13:24.740
I'll make sure of that.

13:24.740 --> 13:27.040
<i>What? Is this guy serious?</i>

13:27.040 --> 13:29.160
<i>Is this normal for him?</i>

13:29.160 --> 13:31.710
I want you to give your absolute best effort

13:31.710 --> 13:34.250
to make sure you don't drag me down.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.380
'Scuze me?!

13:36.750 --> 13:41.090
No one would agree to that after being talked down to like that!

13:41.090 --> 13:42.180
So what do you suggest?

13:43.300 --> 13:45.640
Do you plan to keep watching from outside?

13:48.640 --> 13:54.020
The only match I ever played in junior high was the one against your team.

13:54.310 --> 13:58.780
We never had enough players to apply to tournaments until then.

13:58.780 --> 14:03.240
And I had no place to play, so I always practiced in a corner of the gym or the hallway.

14:03.910 --> 14:04.990
<i>Hallway?</i>

14:05.780 --> 14:13.330
So when I stood in the middle of that huge gymnasium for my very first match ever,

14:13.330 --> 14:15.830
it was like I had become the main character.

14:15.830 --> 14:18.210
It was like, "whoa."

14:18.750 --> 14:19.960
<i>"Whoa"?</i>

14:20.460 --> 14:22.260
I wanted to stay there forever.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.340
But only the strong...

14:26.760 --> 14:29.520
<b>Kitagawa First
Loses Just Barely</b>

14:27.680 --> 14:29.520
get to stay on the court.

14:30.270 --> 14:31.310
So what's the plan?

14:31.310 --> 14:34.230
You'll be turned away unless we go together.

14:34.230 --> 14:36.730
If it means I can play volleyball,

14:38.360 --> 14:41.240
I can endure anything for a little while!

14:41.240 --> 14:44.660
I'll do my best not to look at you.
 That way I can't see what a bastard you are!

14:44.660 --> 14:46.700
You took the words right out of my mouth, you moron!

14:46.700 --> 14:47.780
Excuse me.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.170
Can I please get through?

15:05.590 --> 15:07.720
Kiyoko! Thanks for all your hard work!

15:07.720 --> 15:08.600
I'll carry that!

15:08.600 --> 15:10.640
No, thanks. I'll carry it myself.

15:10.640 --> 15:13.270
Kiyoko, you look lovely today.

15:15.440 --> 15:18.770
I love it when she ignores me!

15:24.490 --> 15:26.160
Good job!

15:27.360 --> 15:32.160
Do you think they'll show up asking to be let join the team if they can beat us in a match?

15:32.160 --> 15:33.160
Probably!

15:33.160 --> 15:38.170
All they have to do is cool their heads and demonstrate how they've learned the error of their ways.

15:38.170 --> 15:39.460
Captain!

15:41.090 --> 15:42.800
We would like to challenge you!

15:43.260 --> 15:45.090
Us versus you upperclassmen!

15:45.840 --> 15:47.130
For real?

15:47.130 --> 15:48.300
Three, two...

15:48.680 --> 15:53.060
We'll prove that we can play together!

15:53.060 --> 15:55.560
I heard a countdown.

15:55.560 --> 15:58.810
I kinda like guys like them.

15:58.810 --> 15:59.810
And if you lose?

16:01.230 --> 16:03.030
We'll accept the penalty of your choice.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.030
Hm...

16:05.030 --> 16:09.990
Club Application

16:05.030 --> 16:09.990
Club Application

16:05.400 --> 16:06.780
This should work.

16:06.780 --> 16:09.990
Two other first-years are going to be joining us.

16:10.620 --> 16:13.620
We'll have you play them, three-on-three.

16:14.620 --> 16:20.080
It's a match we hold every year for our new members to see what they're like.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.460
But three-on-three?

16:22.460 --> 16:23.920
Who will be playing on our side?

16:23.920 --> 16:27.840
Tanaka, I want you to be on their side on game day.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.550
What? Me?

16:29.550 --> 16:31.140
You said you kinda liked them.

16:31.140 --> 16:33.600
I don't want to get dragged into their mess!

16:33.600 --> 16:39.230
That's a shame. I really thought you were the only one capable of wrangling these delinquents.

16:40.150 --> 16:42.360
If you insist!

16:42.360 --> 16:43.520
I'll do it.

16:45.110 --> 16:46.820
Happy to hear that?

16:46.820 --> 16:49.240
So, in the event that you lose,

16:49.240 --> 16:52.410
for the remainder of my time at this school,

16:52.410 --> 16:54.910
Kageyama will not be allowed to play setter.

16:55.330 --> 16:56.330
Huh?

16:56.330 --> 16:58.660
Is that all?

16:59.160 --> 17:04.840
A team can't win with a grandstanding, over-aggressive, egocentric setter.

17:06.460 --> 17:07.420
What's the matter?

17:07.420 --> 17:10.090
I'm not saying that your application will be rejected.

17:10.510 --> 17:12.970
I'm sure you can easily handle other positions.

17:13.850 --> 17:15.600
I'm a setter!

17:16.220 --> 17:17.890
Then win.

17:18.230 --> 17:21.600
You're here because you thought you could win without any help, right?

17:21.600 --> 17:23.860
What about me? I'm here too!

17:24.270 --> 17:25.860
The match is Saturday morning!

17:26.280 --> 17:28.990
I'm here too, you know!

17:28.990 --> 17:32.070
Listen up! Your upperclassman Tanaka here is gonna train the heck—

17:32.070 --> 17:33.320
Got it?

17:37.160 --> 17:40.960
Y'know... aren't you being a little hard on them?

17:40.960 --> 17:44.000
You <i>are</i> being more strict than usual, Daichi.

17:44.670 --> 17:46.750
Is there a special reason for that?

17:47.920 --> 17:48.920
Dammit!

17:49.380 --> 17:53.300
What? Are you upset because you're the only one who gets penalized?

17:53.300 --> 17:58.390
Well, even if you're not a setter, I'm sure you could get a starting position and begin playing just like that.

17:58.890 --> 17:59.930
Besides...

18:00.850 --> 18:03.480
spikers are way cooler than setters!

18:03.480 --> 18:04.940
They get to slam the ball.

18:05.940 --> 18:07.770
You bastard!

18:07.770 --> 18:10.490
The setter is the team's playmaker!

18:10.780 --> 18:13.990
The setter is the one who has 
the most contact with the ball!

18:14.320 --> 18:17.240
It's the coolest position of all
 because it makes you the ruler!

18:17.240 --> 18:17.990
Huh?

18:17.990 --> 18:21.580
You can't hit your precious spikes 
without a setter to set you the ball!

18:21.960 --> 18:26.790
But a setter's job is way too difficult, and it doesn't stand out.

18:29.210 --> 18:32.970
Have you ever seen a huge tournament in person?

18:32.970 --> 18:34.050
No.

18:34.890 --> 18:37.350
You can't tell it from the angle you see on TV,

18:37.890 --> 18:39.810
but if you watch from the end of the court,

18:39.810 --> 18:43.640
you'll be able to see how fast the setter sets the ball.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.560
It flies from one side of the court to the other!

18:46.560 --> 18:49.230
Then the ball passes right in front of the opponent's blockers,

18:49.230 --> 18:52.860
and you think, "Hey! Can he seriously hit that?!"

18:53.150 --> 18:55.780
But there's a spiker ready to strike that ball.

18:55.780 --> 18:58.830
And he smashes that sucker in!

18:59.280 --> 19:00.990
R-Right.

19:01.870 --> 19:04.960
The spiker really is cool, but it's the setter

19:06.250 --> 19:10.880
who tricks the opponent into blocking and breaks the wall open for the spiker to get through!

19:10.880 --> 19:14.720
The setter's job is difficult, cool, and awesome!

19:15.590 --> 19:18.140
I understand that you want to be the setter.

19:18.550 --> 19:20.850
Kageyama will not be allowed to play setter.

19:21.140 --> 19:21.970
Damn!

19:22.680 --> 19:23.560
What's his problem?!

19:24.480 --> 19:25.940
We just have to win.

19:25.940 --> 19:28.770
You looked confident enough
 when you went to challenge them.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.980
<i>He's right. Don't let them shake you.</i>

19:31.980 --> 19:33.530
<i>This guy won't be any help.</i>

19:33.530 --> 19:35.700
<i>I just need to set for that second-year guy.</i>

19:36.240 --> 19:40.280
Hey! We have to work on your shitty receiving by Saturday!

19:40.280 --> 19:44.040
Shitty? Anyway, we won't be able to use the gym.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.380
Oh, yes.

19:48.710 --> 19:51.590
I guess we really gotta start
 morning practice at 7 AM, right?

19:51.590 --> 19:54.130
What? Well, yeah. What got into you?

19:54.130 --> 19:55.970
Oh, nothing.

19:55.970 --> 19:58.760
Do you think the veep's toupée made it out alive?

19:58.760 --> 20:00.600
Hey! No discussing that!

20:01.720 --> 20:03.060
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

20:04.020 --> 20:04.980
At 5 AM!

20:04.980 --> 20:06.350
Don't be late.

20:06.350 --> 20:07.480
That goes for you.

20:13.570 --> 20:16.190
My bag! I forgot my bag!

20:21.450 --> 20:23.120
Just what I was afraid of.

20:23.540 --> 20:25.000
It's locked.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.830
Okay, look for a window we can go through.

20:26.830 --> 20:29.460
We'll get in trouble if we're spotted. Are you stupid?

20:29.460 --> 20:32.090
Dang, 5 AM is a little tough.

20:32.090 --> 20:33.420
Tanaka?!

20:34.340 --> 20:37.130
Make sure to clear out by 7.

20:38.630 --> 20:39.970
Tanaka!

20:39.970 --> 20:41.010
Thank you!

20:41.760 --> 20:43.810
What a great upperclassman I am!

20:43.810 --> 20:45.390
You should show me some respect.

20:45.390 --> 20:46.730
Yes, sir!

20:47.640 --> 20:48.980
Again!

20:48.980 --> 20:51.150
Yes, sir!

20:52.060 --> 20:54.940
Okay! Let's start practicing!

20:55.690 --> 20:58.900
You <i>are</i> being more strict than usual, Daichi.

20:59.820 --> 21:02.120
Is there a special reason for that?

21:03.030 --> 21:07.080
You guys saw them play last year.

21:07.660 --> 21:12.290
Kageyama supposedly had exception ability for a junior-high student,

21:12.290 --> 21:15.170
but he has almost nothing to
 show for it. It needs to change.

21:15.170 --> 21:17.800
His individualism will play out the same as in junior high.

21:18.340 --> 21:20.430
He could drag down the team.

21:21.090 --> 21:22.760
What sets the situation apart from junior high

21:23.680 --> 21:27.020
is that Hinata is playing on the same team.

21:27.350 --> 21:32.560
Hinata? Well, yeah. He is kind of like a raw mass of agility.

21:32.560 --> 21:35.730
Yeah, but he isn't at his full potential.

21:35.730 --> 21:40.820
He has extraordinary speed and reflexes, plus that jumping ability.

21:40.820 --> 21:43.700
But he didn't have a setter in junior high.

21:44.160 --> 21:48.660
Kageyama on the other hand wants a spiker fast enough to hit his sets.

21:49.250 --> 21:51.790
Apart, they're incomplete,

21:51.790 --> 21:53.420
but put them together...

21:59.260 --> 22:01.010
Get them to work in combination...

22:03.340 --> 22:05.850
and Karasuno will evolve by leaps and bounds!

22:07.430 --> 22:08.810
Don't you agree?

22:10.480 --> 22:12.730
Screw you! I'm going in first!

22:12.730 --> 22:15.560
Tanaka's already inside, so you can't be first!

22:15.560 --> 22:17.440
If that's what you think, then move!

22:17.440 --> 22:19.150
Hey! There's no time—

22:21.240 --> 22:24.660
<i>We got a long way to go before combos come into play.</i>

22:26.370 --> 22:29.290
Ooh, the gym!

22:29.290 --> 22:31.040
You were here yesterday.

22:31.370 --> 22:35.130
<i>So the Little Giant practiced in here, huh?</i>

22:36.250 --> 22:38.000
<i>Okay!</i>

22:38.460 --> 22:41.260
<i>Let's do this!</i>

22:42.010 --> 22:42.010
{ED}

22:52.640 --> 22:56.560
If I tell you this story,

22:56.560 --> 23:00.320
I wonder if I can explain to you

23:00.820 --> 23:04.780
my feelings

23:04.780 --> 23:07.780
and the distance between us

23:08.490 --> 23:16.460
Standing on an empty field

23:16.790 --> 23:25.380
I breathe out into the night air

23:25.380 --> 23:29.930
Countless times I swore that I would change

23:29.930 --> 23:33.930
I stumbled and fell a lot,

23:33.930 --> 23:37.900
but I swore I would laugh at the end

23:37.900 --> 23:41.820
and not let my tears go to waste

23:41.820 --> 23:45.820
There are so many dreams that can definitely come true

23:45.820 --> 23:49.820
I always sat somewhere, downcast, dejected, depressed,

23:49.820 --> 23:52.370
but still I decided I would fight,

23:52.370 --> 23:57.370
and not let all my frustration go to waste

23:57.370 --> 24:01.710
This is our revenge

24:12.010 --> 24:12.010

24:12.640 --> 24:14.890
<i>Damn, thanks to Hinata, this is a horrific start.</i>

24:14.890 --> 24:17.270
<i>It's your fault for insisting on doing it all by yourself!</i>

24:17.270 --> 24:19.440
<i>I'd rather do it all myself than work with you!</i>

24:19.440 --> 24:20.560
<i>I'm telling you, that's the prob—</i>

24:20.150 --> 24:22.820
<i>Hey, don't waste our early start on squabbling!</i>

24:23.190 --> 24:23.900
<i>Yessir!</i>

24:23.900 --> 24:25.280
