01:01.290 --> 01:07.710
I take a step with my left foot to break the silence

01:08.420 --> 01:14.890
Get your nervousness in check and reign in your mind

Are you good to go, Kunimi?

02:38.510 --> 02:39.350
Yes, sir.

02:39.350 --> 02:43.060
Hey! You two are amazing!

02:47.360 --> 02:51.320
<i>I didn't know Kunimi knew how to chase after a ball for dear life.</i>

Don't stop chasing it halfway!

Kageyama!

03:03.580 --> 03:06.080
I'll do the broad jump as many times as it takes!

03:06.080 --> 03:07.210
Until it works!

03:08.460 --> 03:09.290
Right.

03:11.170 --> 03:12.210
Let's go!

03:12.210 --> 03:13.920
Yes!

03:15.300 --> 03:17.010
Give us a good serve!

03:15.680 --> 03:17.010
We have the momentum!

03:17.010 --> 03:18.510
Give it all you've got, Tanaka!

03:18.890 --> 03:20.810
Okay, here goes nothing!

03:22.680 --> 03:23.640
I've got it!

They're out of formation!

Center!

03:24.100 --> 03:25.140
Block it!

03:26.980 --> 03:28.190
We can score off this!

03:33.780 --> 03:34.860
Here's our chance!

03:35.530 --> 03:37.240
One more ball!

03:41.120 --> 03:42.910
Nice receive, Watari!

03:43.450 --> 03:45.160
Number ten resets fast!

03:47.670 --> 03:49.040
Nice block!

03:49.750 --> 03:52.960
One more time!

03:53.380 --> 03:57.470
I know you're getting the set, 
so I ain't gonna leave you unmarked!

Hey! Hinata just saved our butts!

04:29.710 --> 04:30.750
This time...

04:30.750 --> 04:32.340
We're rushing them!

04:32.340 --> 04:33.040
Yeah!

04:33.040 --> 04:34.960
...Karasuno gets to say "check."

04:36.050 --> 04:38.050
Keep calm. We'll take it back!

04:38.050 --> 04:39.180
Yessir!

04:40.050 --> 04:42.390
Tanaka, serve up another one!

04:42.720 --> 04:43.470

04:48.180 --> 04:49.310
Yes!

04:49.640 --> 04:50.980
The score may be tied,

04:51.440 --> 04:56.230
but Karasuno still has the upper hand as long as Seijou doesn't score right now.

04:57.070 --> 04:58.190
That being said...

05:00.320 --> 05:03.570
once again, Oikawa is serving at the worst time.

05:07.910 --> 05:11.170
<i>I won't let you attack the way you want to.</i>

05:11.170 --> 05:12.880
<i>We're winning this, not you.</i>

05:13.630 --> 05:15.710
<i>We're moving on to a bigger stage.</i>

05:18.760 --> 05:20.470
Shiratorizawa                Kitagawa First

05:18.760 --> 05:20.470
Shiratorizawa                Kitagawa First

05:19.380 --> 05:23.260
I'm gonna humiliate Shiratorizawa instead!

05:29.180 --> 05:33.730
<i>We'll take the advantage back with this play!</i>

05:30.560 --> 05:34.270
Olé!

05:34.980 --> 05:37.190
Nishinoya!

05:45.990 --> 05:47.740
Nice judgment call, Nishinoya!

05:47.740 --> 05:48.410
Right.

05:50.330 --> 05:51.750
He flubbed it.

05:51.750 --> 05:53.830
I can't believe Oikawa flubbed a serve.

05:53.830 --> 05:56.290
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

05:53.830 --> 05:56.290
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

05:54.170 --> 05:56.290
It's match point for Karasuno again.

05:56.590 --> 06:01.260
He has to be losing it big time to screw up the serves he's usually so good at!

05:57.420 --> 05:59.130
Give us a good serve, Hinata!

06:01.260 --> 06:03.760
Yeah, even Oikawa isn't invulnerable.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.140
That evens the score.

06:08.140 --> 06:10.180
A point is a point either way.

06:10.180 --> 06:12.640
Iwaizumi, you're so cool!

06:12.640 --> 06:14.940
Now I feel inferior to you.

06:14.940 --> 06:17.650
Since when have you been superior to me?

06:18.020 --> 06:23.360
<i>In reality, there may very well be a significant difference between scoring on your serve or your opponent's serve.</i>

06:18.320 --> 06:20.570
Historically, I've always been superior!

06:20.570 --> 06:21.570
Ow!

06:23.860 --> 06:32.080
<i>But the most important thing for now is that Iwaizumi's actions and words have kept the team from falling apart.</i>

06:24.530 --> 06:26.320
Okay, let's get that point.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.240
Right!

06:32.750 --> 06:37.170
Is it really true that Seijou has never made it to nationals?

06:37.170 --> 06:38.750
They're such a solid team.

06:38.750 --> 06:41.710
Maybe, but in reality, they're still lagging behind.

06:41.710 --> 06:46.800
Both teams are exhausted physically, but mentally, Seijou has to be way more exhausted.

06:41.710 --> 06:47.510
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

06:41.710 --> 06:47.510
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

06:46.800 --> 06:48.260
Don't let them catch up, Karasuno!

06:52.810 --> 06:54.770
<b>Rule the Court</b>

06:52.810 --> 06:54.770
<b>Rule the Court</b>

07:19.460 --> 07:22.590
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

07:19.460 --> 07:22.590
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

07:20.460 --> 07:22.590
Whoa!

07:22.590 --> 07:24.840
They both passed thirty points!

07:24.840 --> 07:26.840
It's gotta be hard on both sides.

07:26.840 --> 07:31.640
Yeah, but I get the feeling that Karasuno is barely keeping the ball in play.

07:31.640 --> 07:34.270
Their attacks seem to be getting a little uninspired.

07:34.680 --> 07:37.900
Sure, Seijou has to be feeling the 
psychological pressure worse, but...

07:38.480 --> 07:41.520
Oikawa, you can do it!

07:41.520 --> 07:43.940
Ugh! That put the rotation around full circle!

07:43.940 --> 07:44.860
Give us a good one!

07:44.530 --> 07:49.410
He'll be mindful of that serve he flubbed last time, so how will he handle it?

07:44.860 --> 07:45.820
One point!

07:49.410 --> 07:54.830
Oikawa, you'd better not be thinking about Ushiwaka during the match, or I'll clobber you one.

07:58.620 --> 08:04.050
Someone who's blind to the opponent in front of them can't beat the opponent that comes after them.

08:12.930 --> 08:14.220
You're right.

08:15.430 --> 08:16.600
One point and he's gone!

08:16.600 --> 08:17.180
Yessir!

08:46.670 --> 08:48.380
It's coming back! We have a chance to score!

08:48.380 --> 08:49.340
I've got it!

08:50.010 --> 08:54.810
<i>Considering how he messed up the last one, 
I think that might be the greatest serve I've seen all day!</i>

08:55.220 --> 08:56.850
Shit, I'm sorry!

08:56.850 --> 08:59.520
Be grateful that you even got that up in the air!

09:00.060 --> 09:02.060
<i>Calm down! Calm down!</i>

09:00.730 --> 09:02.060
I've got it!

09:02.060 --> 09:03.730
<i>Don't jump at the decoy!</i>

09:03.730 --> 09:05.020
<i>Will it be a fast attack?</i>

09:05.020 --> 09:07.940
<i>Or does this situation call for their ace?</i>

09:06.980 --> 09:07.940
Left!

09:10.110 --> 09:10.860
<i>The opposite side?!</i>

09:11.410 --> 09:12.070
<i>Is it...</i>

09:13.950 --> 09:15.160
<i>Kunimi again?!</i>

09:17.040 --> 09:17.660
Kunimi!

09:18.660 --> 09:22.370
You have to go in for the hit even if they know you're a decoy!

09:22.370 --> 09:26.500
But the opponent could obviously tell the ball was going left.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.420
Why waste the energy?

09:30.720 --> 09:33.890
You're good at it, so why don't you ever take the sport seriously?

09:35.930 --> 09:39.310
So I'm not serious unless I'm constantly busting my balls?

09:43.940 --> 09:45.020
We can score here!

09:45.020 --> 09:45.770
I've got it!

09:45.770 --> 09:47.190
<i>He still has energy?!</i>

09:48.530 --> 09:51.530
<i>Kunimi, I just saw you slacking on your decoy work.</i>

09:53.280 --> 09:53.860
I'm s—

09:53.860 --> 09:59.040
You'd better learn to be more sneaky or Mizoguchi will yell at you again.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.620
Kunimi, you moron!

10:00.960 --> 10:06.340
You're efficient, conservative, and always calm. 
That's your secret weapon.

10:06.340 --> 10:11.420
Rest assured you'll make up for it by playing full throttle at the end when the rest of us are too tired to play.

10:13.220 --> 10:16.600
<i>A real setter gets every player on his team working at 100%!</i>

10:16.600 --> 10:18.220
<i>No matter who that player may be!</i>

10:18.220 --> 10:19.680
<i>Got it?!</i>

10:19.680 --> 10:21.390
<i>Number thirteen again?!</i>

10:23.850 --> 10:25.060
<i>A diversion!</i>

10:27.980 --> 10:30.440
Aoba Jousai                   Karasuno

10:27.980 --> 10:30.440
Aoba Jousai                   Karasuno

10:28.820 --> 10:30.440
Seijou made their comeback!

10:30.860 --> 10:32.780
Seijou has match point again!

10:32.780 --> 10:35.530
Not only that, Oikawa still has the serve!

10:37.030 --> 10:42.540
<i>We were on the same team for three years, but I never saw...</i>

10:43.160 --> 10:44.580
Good going.

10:43.790 --> 10:47.630
<i>Kunimi smile during a match like a normal player before.</i>

10:44.580 --> 10:45.370
Not bad!

10:45.370 --> 10:46.420
Keep it up!

10:48.040 --> 10:50.090
Guys, wait a second. I need to say something.

10:48.960 --> 10:50.090
<i>Who are you?</i>

10:51.090 --> 10:52.800
<i>How am I supposed to</i>

10:53.970 --> 10:56.090
<i>compete with someone like you?</i>

10:55.300 --> 10:56.090
Kageyama?

10:56.970 --> 10:58.350
Kageyama?

10:58.350 --> 10:59.560
Kageyama!

10:59.930 --> 11:01.270
Earth to Kageyama!

11:02.310 --> 11:06.060
Hey, don't tell me you're getting spooked out. Talk about lame!

11:06.060 --> 11:07.350
Whoa!

11:08.060 --> 11:11.530
Th-Think about it! Obviously a great king is gonna be better than a king.

11:11.530 --> 11:12.940
That goes name-wise too!

11:12.940 --> 11:15.860
Heck, he even looks smarter than you!

11:15.860 --> 11:17.240
My bad, Kageyama!

11:18.410 --> 11:22.290
I'll get the ball back to you the next time.

11:22.830 --> 11:27.500
Then we'll play it like usual and do the attack you think is best.

11:28.330 --> 11:29.250
Kageyama!

11:29.710 --> 11:31.460
Quit second-guessing!

11:31.960 --> 11:33.420
What is everyone on our team?

11:41.010 --> 11:43.020
They're good at what they do.

11:45.310 --> 11:48.310
Do you think our king got spooked by the Great King?

11:51.520 --> 11:56.490
It's okay, 'cause Kageyama isn't a lonely king anymore.

12:13.300 --> 12:19.970
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:19.970 --> 12:25.430
Go for it! Go, go, go, go, Seijou!

12:19.970 --> 12:23.470
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

12:19.970 --> 12:23.470
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

12:23.470 --> 12:25.430
Okay, bring it!

12:25.430 --> 12:30.310
Attack! Attack, attack, attack, attack, Seijou!

12:25.720 --> 12:27.100
Bring it!

12:27.480 --> 12:28.850
We're getting that point!

12:28.850 --> 12:30.310
Yeah!

12:31.770 --> 12:34.730
Aw, yuck.

12:35.150 --> 12:36.940
What a nuisance.

12:37.860 --> 12:39.570
Give us a good serve!

12:39.030 --> 12:43.030
Tobio, you and your rapid rate of evolution

12:39.570 --> 12:40.700
One point!

12:40.700 --> 12:42.370
Now, bring it!

12:43.780 --> 12:46.040
might have me beat.

12:50.500 --> 12:51.420
But...

12:52.540 --> 12:56.630
Olé!

12:57.550 --> 12:57.920
Front!

13:01.140 --> 13:01.970
It's up!

13:01.970 --> 13:03.010
But they're not in formation!

13:03.010 --> 13:04.760
They can't do a fast attack!

13:05.600 --> 13:10.440
<i>Just when the pressure of the situation has you too tense, a diversion comes for that tiny hole in your defense.</i>

13:10.980 --> 13:13.900
<i>The terrifyingly calm focus to rip victory from your grasp!</i>

13:14.400 --> 13:15.610
Left!

13:14.690 --> 13:15.610
Center!

13:16.280 --> 13:17.030
Left!

13:17.320 --> 13:19.190
Asahi, go!

13:20.240 --> 13:21.160
Keep it in play!

13:21.160 --> 13:21.570
Iwa!

13:23.740 --> 13:24.700
It's up—

13:25.660 --> 13:26.910
Do it, Kindaichi!

13:27.240 --> 13:31.370
<i>You have me beat in both speed and reflexes. However...</i>

13:33.040 --> 13:36.750
<i>In a head-on battle for height, I'm the best!</i>

13:37.250 --> 13:38.050
It's up!

13:38.050 --> 13:39.210
Get it!

13:39.970 --> 13:40.670
I've got it!

13:41.220 --> 13:42.510
Kindaichi! Kunimi!

13:42.510 --> 13:42.930
Yes, sir!

13:43.640 --> 13:44.340
Left!

13:47.310 --> 13:47.930
<i>Now!</i>

13:48.470 --> 13:49.390
<i>This position!</i>

13:49.730 --> 13:50.850
<i>This timing!</i>

13:51.310 --> 13:52.310
<i>This angle!</i>

13:54.520 --> 13:55.650
<i>It's bang-on!</i>

14:14.920 --> 14:15.920
<i>Tobio.</i>

14:16.540 --> 14:19.130
<i>You and your rapid rate of evolution</i>

14:19.130 --> 14:21.630
<i>might have me beat.</i>

14:22.380 --> 14:23.050
<i>But...</i>

14:32.770 --> 14:35.060
<i>not today.</i>

14:41.740 --> 14:43.700
Right on!

14:49.450 --> 14:50.620
We did it!

14:50.620 --> 14:51.330
Let's go.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.330
Yes!

14:55.920 --> 14:58.840
Hinata, Kageyama. Time to line up.

15:02.090 --> 15:03.800
Captain, I'm sorry.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.050
You didn't mess that up.

15:05.590 --> 15:07.430
No apology is required!

15:10.100 --> 15:11.890
Thank you for the match!

15:38.830 --> 15:41.500
Guys, wait a second. I need to say something.

15:41.800 --> 15:44.840
The next opportunity Karasuno gets to use their fast attack,

15:44.840 --> 15:47.470
Tobio will definitely go for the superhuman version.

15:47.470 --> 15:48.640
Keep that in mind.

15:49.340 --> 15:53.220
How did you know they'd go for
 the superhuman attack in the end?

15:53.220 --> 15:56.850
I knew because Tobio evolved
 alongside those team members.

15:57.980 --> 16:01.060
He's finally learning how to establish a rapport.

16:01.060 --> 16:04.360
As the deuce dragged on, his mental and physical exhaustion peaked.

16:01.060 --> 16:02.980
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

16:01.060 --> 16:02.980
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

16:05.070 --> 16:09.910
So, when his back was truly against the wall, 
he was presented with the oh-so-vital opportunity.

16:09.910 --> 16:13.080
At that specific time, the new Tobio...

16:17.370 --> 16:19.040
had only one option.

16:20.830 --> 16:21.630
Form a line!

16:22.170 --> 16:26.340
Thank you for the match!

16:34.640 --> 16:35.520
Well done!

16:35.520 --> 16:36.640
That was a good match!

16:44.320 --> 16:45.320
Gather 'round!

16:49.740 --> 16:51.200
When we lost,

16:51.870 --> 16:55.200
I hated it when someone told me it was a good match.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.450
I was like, "But I lost!"

16:57.450 --> 17:03.920
But now that it's my turn to say something, 
it's the only appropriate thing I can think to say.

17:07.340 --> 17:10.010
Listen, that last block...

17:09.130 --> 17:13.800
All right! Let's do this!

17:13.800 --> 17:14.970
We need to vacate.

17:15.640 --> 17:17.890
The next team has to start warming up.

17:17.890 --> 17:20.310
We'll cool down upstairs or outside.

17:21.520 --> 17:23.900
Senseki, fight!

17:23.900 --> 17:27.820
Seijou will take a break and proceed to the quarterfinal.

17:34.740 --> 17:37.040
Senseki, fight!

17:37.040 --> 17:39.540
Yeah!

17:43.290 --> 17:48.420
Weren't you gonna console them by saying they couldn't win off the merits of just one player?

17:49.630 --> 17:53.050
Karasuno wasn't a one-man team after all.

17:53.970 --> 17:55.390
You're a real pain in the ass.

17:55.390 --> 17:56.350
That's mean!

17:57.430 --> 18:01.770
When Tobio read that I'd set it to you in the last play of the second set,

18:01.770 --> 18:06.360
I knew he was changing from a dictator king to a decent king.

18:07.570 --> 18:13.740
Tobio still might've given the set to the small fry even if he was still a dictator,

18:13.740 --> 18:18.830
so it was just a possibility at the time, and I didn't think it was a sure thing.

18:19.290 --> 18:25.790
When he showed me he could read my attack, 
it allowed me to turn the tables and read his attack.

18:25.790 --> 18:31.420
So, our Kageyama has finally learned to trust others.

18:33.130 --> 18:34.430
Tell me about it.

18:35.140 --> 18:38.390
Nothing could be more of a nuisance.

18:49.020 --> 18:50.570
The meeting's starting.

18:59.490 --> 19:00.450
Sorry about that.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.870
He read me like a book.

19:10.210 --> 19:11.630
Don't you dare apologize!

19:12.960 --> 19:17.470
Don't make it sound like it was a mistake to set the ball to me!

19:21.470 --> 19:24.140
The meeting is about to start.

19:27.480 --> 19:30.610
The both of you did a fabulous job today.

19:33.110 --> 19:35.200
But we lost.

19:35.530 --> 19:37.320
Yes, you lost.

19:37.320 --> 19:40.240
But don't you think it was a productive match?

19:45.000 --> 19:47.120
Does losing prove that you're weak?

19:49.040 --> 19:52.550
Wouldn't you say that, to you guys, losing is like a trial by fire?

19:52.550 --> 19:56.970
A test to see whether you can get back on your feet after crashing to the ground?

19:58.800 --> 20:03.970
If you guys stay there, down on the ground, that really would prove you're weak.

20:21.240 --> 20:21.240

Okay, let's go eat.

21:53.040 --> 21:54.420
My treat, of course.

21:55.130 --> 21:57.670
What? Eat, sir? But...

21:57.670 --> 21:59.420
Just do as I say, and eat.

22:01.420 --> 22:03.930
<b>Closed</b>

22:01.420 --> 22:03.930
<b>Sit </b>Tavern

22:08.390 --> 22:10.390
Sorry to do this to you right before closing, Ma'am.

22:10.390 --> 22:12.520
Think nothing of it!

22:12.520 --> 22:15.360
This used to be the norm for you, remember?

22:22.110 --> 22:27.620
All that running and jumping puts stress on the muscles and tears the muscle fiber.

22:28.290 --> 22:30.830
At the end of a match, your muscle fibers will be in tatters.

22:32.620 --> 22:35.000
You recover by eating.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
That's how you build muscle.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.460
That's how you get stronger.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.260
So eat up.

22:42.260 --> 22:43.510
Eat a proper meal.

22:47.390 --> 22:49.970
Thank you for the food.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.020
Thank you for the food.

22:52.020 --> 22:54.480
