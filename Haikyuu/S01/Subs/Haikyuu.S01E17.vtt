00:23.960 --> 00:28.300

02:50.400 --> 02:52.190
All of you, listen up!

02:52.610 --> 02:55.530
Karasuno's fast attack definitely took us by surprise!

02:55.530 --> 02:58.410
But that's only due to the height of the spiker!

02:59.280 --> 03:03.450
He may have an incredible vertical, but that's a normal fast attack!

03:03.450 --> 03:05.580
Don't let your eyes fool you.

03:05.580 --> 03:08.960
Completely prevent him from scoring, just as you did with their ace!

03:09.670 --> 03:11.710
Show it to them one more time.

03:11.710 --> 03:14.170
Show them your Iron Wall!

03:14.170 --> 03:15.430
Yessir!

03:16.510 --> 03:18.510
After watching them in the first round,

03:18.850 --> 03:21.850
I expect their first shot will be a powerful serve.

03:21.850 --> 03:24.730
They crush with serves and block every point.

03:24.730 --> 03:29.230
Date Tech starts by discouraging their opponents from the get-go.

03:29.230 --> 03:32.400
Receive the first ball and get it up in the air!

03:32.400 --> 03:33.690
Yessir!

03:34.320 --> 03:36.820
So, you know what to do, Kageyama?

03:36.820 --> 03:37.490
Yes, sir.

03:38.490 --> 03:39.620
Good.

03:39.620 --> 03:42.620
Now break through that Iron Wall!

03:42.620 --> 03:43.620
Yessir!

03:44.620 --> 03:47.330
Karasuno, fight!

03:47.790 --> 03:49.460
Yeah!

03:51.630 --> 03:54.800
That's funny. Karasuno's ace is starting in the back row.

03:55.130 --> 03:59.720
Yeah. They're starting in the strongest receiving formation.

04:00.600 --> 04:03.720
Date Tech is playing it the same as the first round.

04:09.230 --> 04:10.190
<i>You can do it!</i>

04:12.940 --> 04:14.150
Bring it!

04:14.150 --> 04:14.900

04:14.900 --> 04:15.780
Kamasaki, you can do it!

04:15.780 --> 04:16.740
C'mon!

04:18.950 --> 04:19.700
Daichi!

04:20.950 --> 04:21.740
Nice receive!

04:23.200 --> 04:24.950
<i>He has a clean form.</i>

04:24.950 --> 04:27.660
<i>It's difficult to read how high the set will be.</i>

04:28.080 --> 04:29.120
<i>However...</i>

04:40.130 --> 04:42.430
Right on! Nice placement, Hinata!

04:46.720 --> 04:50.940
Here I thought their blockers were one step behind!

04:51.650 --> 04:53.730
Is that "read blocking"?

04:53.730 --> 04:55.900
The type where you jump after seeing the set?

04:55.900 --> 04:56.940
Yeah.

04:57.530 --> 05:03.410
Until now, most opposing schools used "commit blocks," where they jump after predicting the set to a degree.

05:03.410 --> 05:06.330
But Date Tech uses hardcore read blocking.

05:06.700 --> 05:09.460
They jump after they see where the set is going.

05:10.000 --> 05:10.960
In other words...

05:12.040 --> 05:15.170
they don't fall for decoys that easily.

05:16.460 --> 05:22.640
This sets them a step behind making the block, 
but their number seven narrows that gap instantly.

05:22.640 --> 05:24.430
He's big, and he's fast.

05:24.430 --> 05:26.390
That's scary.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.180
Their read blocking is going to be trouble.

05:29.180 --> 05:30.980
How do you think Karasuno will deal with it?

05:30.980 --> 05:32.020
I'm not sure.

05:32.020 --> 05:36.360
Karasuno hasn't used their big guns in this tournament yet.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.320
Karasuno             Date Tech

05:36.360 --> 05:38.320
Karasuno             Date Tech

05:39.320 --> 05:40.700
Kageyama, give us a nice serve!

05:40.700 --> 05:42.280
Take it for a point!

05:46.370 --> 05:46.830
<i>Shit!</i>

05:47.580 --> 05:49.040
<i>I sent it straight to their libero!</i>

05:49.870 --> 05:52.370
That's one powerful serve.

05:52.370 --> 05:55.750
He'll be scary to face once he learns to control it.

05:58.550 --> 05:59.760
Whoa, he dug it out!

05:59.760 --> 06:00.760
Holy crap!

06:01.090 --> 06:02.340
Sorry, Ryuu! Cover it!

06:02.340 --> 06:02.930
Got it!

06:03.380 --> 06:04.180
Back!

06:04.510 --> 06:05.890
<i>A back attack?!</i>

06:05.890 --> 06:08.390
<i>There were practically none in the previous match.</i>

06:08.760 --> 06:09.850
Asahi!

06:16.270 --> 06:17.270
Shit!

06:17.650 --> 06:18.650
Aw...

06:18.650 --> 06:20.740
There was nothing you could do! Put it behind you!

06:21.360 --> 06:22.700
Asahi, I'm sorry!

06:22.700 --> 06:23.950
I'll get the next one!

06:25.570 --> 06:26.950
Sure. Thanks.

06:26.950 --> 06:28.370
But I'll make the next one count!

06:28.660 --> 06:32.540
Huh? Aw, come on. Would it kill you to be more dejected?

06:32.540 --> 06:34.790
Stop talking like a thug, Futakuchi!

06:34.790 --> 06:35.830
Ow!

06:35.830 --> 06:38.040
Karasuno             Date Tech

06:35.830 --> 06:38.040
Karasuno             Date Tech

06:43.380 --> 06:44.220
<i>Damn!</i>

06:45.720 --> 06:46.430
Huh?

06:47.890 --> 06:49.010
All right!

06:49.010 --> 06:50.100
Net touch.

06:49.010 --> 06:50.100
We lucked out!

06:51.100 --> 06:53.230
Just don't let it get to you!

06:53.680 --> 06:56.440
Date Tech just touched the net?

06:56.440 --> 06:58.690
Karasuno avoided disaster.

06:59.110 --> 07:00.900
They're pretty good, though.

07:00.900 --> 07:04.700
The bond between their fast attacks and blocks is tight.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.320
They're gonna be tough.

07:09.910 --> 07:10.620
Nice receive!

07:10.950 --> 07:11.370
Futakuchi!

07:14.330 --> 07:15.120
I'm open!

07:15.120 --> 07:15.870
Asahi!

07:22.880 --> 07:24.800
Right on!

07:23.260 --> 07:26.010
What, is it out? We get the point?

07:26.010 --> 07:27.590
Nice job, Azumane!

07:32.430 --> 07:36.890
{=1}Karasuno             Date Tech

07:32.430 --> 07:36.890
{=0}Karasuno             Date Tech

07:33.430 --> 07:36.890
Karasuno is barely maintaining their lead.

07:37.480 --> 07:43.030
But they're being thwarted just enough to
 prevent them from making satisfying spikes.

07:43.030 --> 07:43.860
Yes.

07:44.360 --> 07:48.860
If the blocks they're narrowly avoiding start to catch up to them multiple times in a row,

07:47.990 --> 07:48.860
Nice receive!

07:48.860 --> 07:51.200
the momentum will be taken from them.

07:51.200 --> 07:51.830
Futakuchi!

07:52.790 --> 07:54.580
Nice job getting a hand on it, Hinata!

07:54.580 --> 07:55.540
No way!

07:56.120 --> 07:57.160
Here's our chance to score!

07:58.170 --> 08:03.210
<i>We take the point that was nearly theirs and make it ours in a split-second.</i>

08:04.050 --> 08:08.180
<i>We break their spirits while simultaneously boosting our own morale.</i>

08:08.930 --> 08:12.100
<i>It is both the strongest defense and the fastest attack.</i>

08:12.680 --> 08:13.510
<i>That...</i>

08:17.060 --> 08:18.140
<i>is the block.</i>

08:20.060 --> 08:22.770
<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

08:20.060 --> 08:22.770
<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

08:23.150 --> 08:24.730
Nice block!

08:25.110 --> 08:26.740
Nice one, Aone!

08:26.740 --> 08:30.240
Way to go, way to go, Aone!

08:28.780 --> 08:32.660
It's a faster, wider, higher wall.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.410
Good, good! Very good! Good, good!

08:35.080 --> 08:36.330
<i>There's no doubt.</i>

08:38.040 --> 08:39.330
<i>It's an Iron Wall.</i>

08:43.670 --> 08:45.300
Shit!

08:45.300 --> 08:47.300
Don't fret it. Focus on the next one.

08:47.300 --> 08:48.130
Huh?

08:48.550 --> 08:50.840
We'll definitely score next time.

08:51.220 --> 08:52.220
We will?

08:52.800 --> 08:54.680
Oh! Wanna go for it?

08:54.680 --> 08:56.560
ls it time to do the zoom?!

08:56.930 --> 08:58.850
It feels like it's been ages.

08:59.640 --> 09:04.110
I want you to use your fastest speed and best jump.

09:05.020 --> 09:06.480
I'll bring the ball

09:07.610 --> 09:08.650
to you.

09:10.070 --> 09:10.110
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

09:10.110 --> 09:10.150

09:17.240 --> 09:23.960
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

09:27.000 --> 09:30.340
<i>Karasuno's fastest attack will come from their number ten.</i>

09:31.630 --> 09:35.350
<i>However, their fast attack will be within the perimeter of our wall.</i>

09:36.060 --> 09:39.560
So why aren't they acting the least bit flustered?

09:41.100 --> 09:46.110
Do you know why our deviant fast attack 
was foiled when we played against Nekoma?

09:46.360 --> 09:48.570
Yes, sir! Because Inuoka was crazy impressive!

09:49.110 --> 09:50.190
Uh.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.780
Yeah, I suppose that's a good point.

09:53.320 --> 09:57.120
Because Nekoma's middle blocker
 became accustomed to Hinata's moves.

09:57.450 --> 09:59.580
Yup. Familiarization.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.040
Although in Nekoma's case, I believe 
they had a real sharp player on the team.

10:05.040 --> 10:08.800
I suspect that player was Mr. Pudding-head.

10:09.130 --> 10:10.260
It was Kenma!

10:11.590 --> 10:13.180
Kenma caught a cold!

10:13.180 --> 10:15.720
Inuoka, shut up. I didn't.

10:16.100 --> 10:19.930
To be honest, I didn't expect them to 
come up with a countermeasure that fast,

10:19.930 --> 10:25.440
but sooner or later, every team will become accustomed to the deviant fast attack and learn to keep up with it.

10:26.060 --> 10:30.400
Your fast attack is quite a powerful weapon, 
but it isn't invincible.

10:31.190 --> 10:32.900
The most important thing is...

10:33.610 --> 10:34.740
<i>...how we use it.</i>

10:36.120 --> 10:37.830
Karasuno             Date Tech

10:36.120 --> 10:37.830
Karasuno             Date Tech

10:41.910 --> 10:42.580
Ryuu!

10:42.580 --> 10:43.120
Got it!

10:44.290 --> 10:48.920
<i>Even the most finely tuned read blocking can't keep up with this!</i>

11:00.100 --> 11:01.640
What <i>was</i> that?!

11:03.350 --> 11:04.390
Yeah!

11:04.390 --> 11:05.310
Yes!

11:05.310 --> 11:07.520
They used their monster fast attack.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.110
It sure is intense.

11:09.110 --> 11:11.530
Wow, that's scary. It's obscene.

11:12.230 --> 11:14.990
Prodigies really piss me off.

11:15.490 --> 11:17.530
What a ridiculous set.

11:17.530 --> 11:21.120
Did he make that hard set just to shake off Aone?

11:21.120 --> 11:24.370
It couldn't be that simple. The spiker hit it too well.

11:24.370 --> 11:27.370
But that had to be a fluke.

11:27.370 --> 11:28.630
Do you know who he is?

11:29.290 --> 11:30.920
Their number ten.

11:30.920 --> 11:34.880
No. I don't recall him from the
 junior high tournament whatsoever.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.760
<i>Was it a fluke, or was it deliberate?</i>

11:38.550 --> 11:40.300
Tsukishima, we're counting on you.

11:40.300 --> 11:40.760
Sure.

11:41.510 --> 11:44.600
Your Highness, I'd like a set further back from the net.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.980
I don't want to be caught up by blockers.

11:48.980 --> 11:50.230
Hmph.

11:50.230 --> 11:51.020
What was that?

11:51.020 --> 11:52.480
I said fine!

11:52.480 --> 11:54.860
No, you obviously didn't.

11:54.860 --> 11:57.530
So you don't like being ordered by plebeians. I see how it is!

11:57.530 --> 11:59.070
Huh?!

11:59.070 --> 12:00.370
Guys, knock it off!

12:00.370 --> 12:01.490
You never learn!

12:01.490 --> 12:04.790
Kageyama finally used his fast attack.

12:04.790 --> 12:07.330
I'll bet Date Tech is confused.

12:07.330 --> 12:11.290
You'll never find another fast attack like it in the world.

12:12.090 --> 12:14.130
I'm terrified of what they might become.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.420
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

12:17.420 --> 12:19.470
Dumbass! Hinata, you klutzy piece of shit!

12:17.800 --> 12:20.510
Everything else is a learning curve.

12:19.470 --> 12:20.510
Shake it off.

12:20.510 --> 12:21.890
Noya, I'm sorry.

12:21.890 --> 12:22.720
I've got this!

12:22.720 --> 12:25.680
Karasuno             Date Tech

12:22.720 --> 12:25.680
Karasuno             Date Tech

12:24.140 --> 12:25.680
Aone, give us a good one!

12:29.980 --> 12:31.060
All right!

12:31.060 --> 12:32.860
That was a normal set.

12:34.400 --> 12:35.990
Was the last one a fluke?

12:35.990 --> 12:38.280
Or is number ten the only one who can do it?

12:38.650 --> 12:39.700
Good job!

12:42.240 --> 12:44.790
Nice, Tsukishima! One more!

12:44.790 --> 12:45.950
Tsukki, nice one!

12:48.910 --> 12:50.750
Hey!

12:51.960 --> 12:54.250
All right! Let's take back what was ours!

12:54.630 --> 12:55.670
Nice, Kamasaki!

12:55.670 --> 12:57.010
Kamacchi, you're awesome!

12:57.840 --> 12:59.430
Let's take it back!

12:59.430 --> 13:00.430
Yeah!

13:01.720 --> 13:04.890
{=2}Karasuno                Date Tech

13:01.720 --> 13:04.890
{=2}Karasuno                Date Tech

13:04.890 --> 13:08.350
{=2}Karasuno              Date Tech

13:04.890 --> 13:08.350
{=2}Karasuno              Date Tech

13:08.560 --> 13:10.770
{=2}Karasuno              Date Tech

13:08.560 --> 13:10.770
{=2}Karasuno              Date Tech

13:12.230 --> 13:14.190
The point gap is static.

13:14.190 --> 13:19.820
But in the current rotation, Karasuno's
 number ten has come to the front row again.

13:20.150 --> 13:21.990
Number ten is here.

13:21.990 --> 13:26.370
Kageyama hasn't made any of those way-too-fast sets since.

13:26.370 --> 13:29.710
That's right! When I saw his 
Kitagawa First match in junior high,

13:30.040 --> 13:36.250
I seem to recall him leaving the spiker in the lurch several times with sets like that last one.

13:37.250 --> 13:42.720
You're right. The moment I saw that set, I was sure
 that his old bad habit had reared its ugly head again.

13:42.720 --> 13:45.930
But their number ten hit that thing.

13:49.140 --> 13:51.140
Almost like he was meant to.

13:52.230 --> 13:53.350
Futakuchi!

13:54.480 --> 13:56.400
Karasuno             Date Tech

13:54.480 --> 13:56.400
Karasuno             Date Tech

13:55.020 --> 13:56.400
Nice, Futakuchi!

13:56.770 --> 13:58.860
Date Tech is tenacious.

13:58.860 --> 14:02.150
Hey, it looks like Karasuno's 
number ten has rotated to the front row.

14:02.150 --> 14:06.160
Date Tech's amazing blocker, number seven, also has his turn in the front row.

14:07.660 --> 14:10.620
It's Iron Wall versus Super-Fast Attack.

14:11.960 --> 14:16.750
<i>They might be thinking that last deviant fast attack was a fluke.</i>

14:17.040 --> 14:18.420
We're going in for another one!

14:18.420 --> 14:19.210
Right!

14:23.180 --> 14:24.720
It's on our side! Forward!

14:25.890 --> 14:26.970
He retrieved it!

14:26.970 --> 14:30.020
But they can't possibly do a fast attack with that positioning.

14:30.390 --> 14:31.480
Who will he give it—

14:36.900 --> 14:38.070
Right on!

14:38.070 --> 14:39.780
Nice job, Hinata, Kageyama!

14:38.940 --> 14:40.570
It's that set again!

14:39.780 --> 14:40.320
Thank you, sir!

14:40.320 --> 14:42.360
Okay! We're going in!

14:40.570 --> 14:44.070
And this time he did it far back from the net!

14:45.530 --> 14:48.240
That isn't a fluke?

14:50.740 --> 14:51.950
Right on!

14:51.950 --> 14:54.540
Date Tech immediately called for a timeout.

14:54.540 --> 14:56.960
Karasuno's number ten is incredible.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.920
You just can't hit a set like that normally.

14:59.250 --> 15:04.510
The setter who aligns the set so perfectly
 for the spiker is more amazing, technically.

15:04.510 --> 15:05.550
Heh!

15:05.550 --> 15:08.470
It's like watching God perform a miracle.

15:08.470 --> 15:10.640
We couldn't figure it out at first either.

15:10.640 --> 15:15.100
Karasuno             Date Tech

15:10.640 --> 15:15.100
Karasuno             Date Tech

15:11.100 --> 15:15.100
If that fast attack is the real deal,
 we can't keep up with it using read blocking.

15:15.810 --> 15:20.070
But ignoring it would be like taking a beating with the gloves down.

15:20.520 --> 15:26.110
Any time there's the possibility of an attack by number ten, don't mark the set. Mark him.

15:26.110 --> 15:28.370
Predict the set and jump.

15:28.370 --> 15:31.620
However, keep in mind that 
the attack may've been a fluke.

15:31.620 --> 15:33.540
Keep cool and play it by ear.

15:33.540 --> 15:34.790
Yes, sir!

15:36.000 --> 15:38.630
I've never seen a fast attack like that before.

15:38.630 --> 15:41.710
Do you think their number ten
 is the only one who can do that?

15:42.090 --> 15:45.670
You know, if that isn't a fluke, that means they're monsters.

15:46.180 --> 15:48.260
That fast attack was freakish,

15:48.260 --> 15:52.140
but the normal fast attacks they've been using 
from the start can sneak by if we're not careful.

15:52.140 --> 15:56.100
Anyway, we just need to stop number ten.

15:57.020 --> 15:59.060
You're way too easygoing.

15:59.060 --> 16:00.900
It's better than being uptight.

16:00.900 --> 16:02.230
That's why you don't get the chicks.

16:02.230 --> 16:03.780
What did you just say?!

16:03.780 --> 16:05.150
But it's true.

16:04.070 --> 16:05.150
Stop them, Aone!

16:05.150 --> 16:06.070
Why, you!

16:08.990 --> 16:13.120
In retrospect, all they've gotta do is stop number ten, right?

16:13.120 --> 16:15.200
He's the only one standing out.

16:15.200 --> 16:18.170
Date Tech's block seems to be beating the rest.

16:18.170 --> 16:19.790
That's true.

16:19.790 --> 16:22.960
Anyway, we're going to stop their number ten!

16:22.960 --> 16:24.210
Yessir!

16:25.550 --> 16:27.260
<i>We need to stop number ten.</i>

16:27.760 --> 16:28.930
<i>Number ten.</i>

16:29.510 --> 16:30.680
<i>Number ten.</i>

16:30.680 --> 16:32.430
<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

16:30.680 --> 16:32.430
<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

16:31.090 --> 16:32.430
<i>Number ten.</i>

16:33.890 --> 16:35.310
<i>Number ten!</i>

16:38.390 --> 16:39.440
Anyway,

16:40.230 --> 16:44.020
"that tiny number ten" will set an excellent mood.

16:44.020 --> 16:46.070
The brighter the mood is...

16:46.440 --> 16:47.650
Now, bring it!

16:47.650 --> 16:49.700
...and the more Hinata shines,

16:50.820 --> 16:53.660
the more it will blind the opponent blockers.

16:56.660 --> 16:59.540
You're so slow! We could've missed the match!

16:59.540 --> 17:01.670
But customers are so rare!

17:01.670 --> 17:02.790
Hurry up!

17:03.960 --> 17:06.800
Great! The boys are still playing their second round match.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.760
I don't believe it! They're beating Date Tech!

17:08.760 --> 17:10.340
Bring it on!

17:14.550 --> 17:15.680
All right!

17:14.850 --> 17:16.680
He's ridiculously fast.

17:16.680 --> 17:18.390
But that was close, Aone!

17:19.350 --> 17:21.350
What was that?

17:21.350 --> 17:22.650
A fast attack?

17:22.650 --> 17:24.650
He's a first-year, isn't he?

17:24.650 --> 17:27.230
Did that little guy just jump incredibly high?

17:29.030 --> 17:30.820
Don't look so smug.

17:31.110 --> 17:32.740
Looking good, Hinata!

17:32.740 --> 17:33.530
What the?

17:33.950 --> 17:36.490
That's the way! Do another one!

17:37.080 --> 17:38.540
Make it a good serve!

17:37.830 --> 17:40.210
Sugawara isn't playing.

17:41.000 --> 17:41.920
Nishinoya!

17:43.750 --> 17:44.330
B!

17:44.330 --> 17:45.340
Give me a set!

17:45.670 --> 17:47.710
<i>Two attackers! Who will it be?!</i>

17:48.880 --> 17:49.510
<i>He's jumping!</i>

17:51.630 --> 17:52.430
<i>He's not jumping!</i>

17:56.470 --> 17:57.600
Yes!

17:57.600 --> 17:59.600
Now a normal fast attack?

17:59.600 --> 18:02.770
So are they setting at different speeds for each scenario?

18:03.600 --> 18:07.070
The thing is, some pretty interesting first-years joined us recently.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.280
If they prove effective,

18:09.280 --> 18:13.320
I think Karasuno can improve by leaps and bounds.

18:15.620 --> 18:16.870
Incredible.

18:17.870 --> 18:20.200
Shit. Who <i>is</i> their number ten?

18:21.160 --> 18:22.410
Okay, listen up!

18:23.500 --> 18:24.670
Don't get sucked in!

18:25.210 --> 18:27.380
We're making our attacks count too!

18:28.050 --> 18:33.720
Yes, their number ten took us by surprise, 
but you guys have overpowered all kinds of spikers!

18:33.720 --> 18:35.390
Including Karasuno's ace!

18:35.680 --> 18:37.430
And we'll stop them again!

18:38.720 --> 18:39.510
Yes, sir!

18:39.510 --> 18:42.980
Please say "we" instead of "you guys."

18:43.850 --> 18:48.440
Futakuchi, I'm sorry I thought you were a snotty underclassman all this time.

18:48.440 --> 18:50.230
Is that what you thought?

19:06.880 --> 19:09.800
<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

19:06.880 --> 19:09.800
<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

19:07.460 --> 19:09.800
Nice job, Aone!

19:11.000 --> 19:12.420
He jumped twice!

19:12.420 --> 19:16.800
When you're that big, the smallest jump can put your hand over the net.

19:17.260 --> 19:22.270
Not only is he tall, his long arms and 
wide shoulders make powerful weapons.

19:22.270 --> 19:24.520
But there's more to him.

19:25.520 --> 19:30.020
He's too calm to get tunnel vision, 
and he has the tenacity to stop the ball.

19:31.150 --> 19:34.530
His block comes from the combination of the two.

19:36.320 --> 19:38.700
Hey, hey. That block is scary.

19:38.700 --> 19:41.620
A block like that can change the momentum.

19:41.620 --> 19:45.540
They need to make the next point, or Date Tech will ride the wave.

19:45.830 --> 19:47.120
We're going to stop another one!

19:47.120 --> 19:48.250
Yeah!

19:48.540 --> 19:50.500
Keep your cool!

19:50.500 --> 19:51.710
Stop them here!

19:53.920 --> 19:56.630
Karasuno             Date Tech

19:53.920 --> 19:56.630
Karasuno             Date Tech

19:54.510 --> 19:56.630
Futakuchi! Give it what you've got!

20:00.010 --> 20:01.180
Sorry, cover it!

20:01.180 --> 20:01.760
Ryuu!

20:01.760 --> 20:02.430
Got it!

20:02.430 --> 20:03.520
Center!

20:03.520 --> 20:04.270
Hinata!

20:04.270 --> 20:04.810
On it!

20:07.890 --> 20:08.940
All right!

20:09.440 --> 20:10.940
Nishinoya!

20:12.110 --> 20:13.280
Kageyama!

20:13.280 --> 20:13.780
Right!

20:14.150 --> 20:15.740
<i>Karasuno has three attackers in the front!</i>

20:16.360 --> 20:17.200
<i>Which will it be?!</i>

20:17.700 --> 20:20.370
Send it my way!

20:26.120 --> 20:27.540
Number ten!

20:37.170 --> 20:38.760
<i>Blaze a path...</i>

20:39.680 --> 20:40.720
<i>for the ace!</i>

20:45.430 --> 20:46.980
<i>I get a clear view</i>

20:48.520 --> 20:49.600
<i>of the other side.</i>

20:51.650 --> 20:53.860
<i>Yes, I remember now.</i>

20:55.360 --> 20:56.280
<i>This is it!</i>

21:05.700 --> 21:06.540
Y—

21:06.540 --> 21:08.660
Yes!

21:11.710 --> 21:15.090
That's the same pipe Nekoma did!

21:18.420 --> 21:20.300
Asahi!

21:20.300 --> 21:22.930
You guys are amazing.

21:24.100 --> 21:25.310
I appreciate it.

21:25.890 --> 21:28.980
Hey, you're the one who made it count!

21:26.810 --> 21:28.350
Nice, Asahi!

21:28.980 --> 21:30.350
Hold your head up high!

21:31.230 --> 21:33.520
I want you to blaze a path for our ace!

21:37.150 --> 21:38.570
Yes!

21:39.690 --> 21:40.530
What's wrong?

21:41.280 --> 21:44.240
I'm not the one who scored that point.

21:44.950 --> 21:47.830
I'm not the one who spiked that, but...

21:49.960 --> 21:51.210
Number ten!

21:53.750 --> 21:57.630
It really gave me chills.

22:01.470 --> 22:05.260
See? Being the greatest decoy
 is just as cool as being the ace.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.020
The greatest...

22:11.390 --> 22:12.350
decoy.

22:13.730 --> 22:18.400
Okay, we've showed them every weapon in our arsenal.

22:21.110 --> 22:24.280
