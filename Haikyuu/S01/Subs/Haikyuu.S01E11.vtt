00:21.790 --> 00:28.090

make mistakes, get angry, and struggle

I want to struggle and fall and become stronger

Hinata, you need to settle down.

02:14.030 --> 02:15.240
Need to pee?

02:17.370 --> 02:21.370
Episode Eleven:
The Decision

02:17.370 --> 02:21.370
Episode Eleven:
The Decision

02:19.240 --> 02:20.450
You're all here.

02:20.450 --> 02:21.580
Yessir!

02:22.120 --> 02:24.710
The practice match against Nekoma takes place in four days.

02:24.710 --> 02:28.040
After that, it'll be time for the interhigh prelims.

02:28.630 --> 02:31.880
There's no time, and you guys are full of weak spots.

02:32.470 --> 02:35.590
There is only one thing to do in order for you slobs to win.

02:36.050 --> 02:39.600
Practice! Practice! Practice!

02:40.140 --> 02:42.230
Keep retrieving that ball until you throw up!

02:42.640 --> 02:43.810
Yessir!

02:43.810 --> 02:46.440
<i>He's already thrown up.</i>

02:47.730 --> 02:48.900
Forward! Forward!

02:51.650 --> 02:54.990
Come on, how many balls are gonna be your last one?!

02:54.990 --> 02:56.320
Focus!

02:56.950 --> 02:57.820
One more!

02:58.240 --> 02:59.080
Here comes!

03:00.240 --> 03:01.620
Nice receive!

03:00.240 --> 03:01.620
Nice, Yamaguchi!

03:01.620 --> 03:03.910
He's completed five! Time to switch.

03:03.910 --> 03:04.710
Next!

03:04.710 --> 03:06.120
Here, sir!

03:05.290 --> 03:06.120
Good work.

03:11.130 --> 03:14.090
Okay. Next, spike practice!

03:14.090 --> 03:15.220
Yessir!

03:16.800 --> 03:18.800
Right on! Take that!

03:18.800 --> 03:20.220
Nice spike!

03:21.600 --> 03:22.850
Nice spike!

03:31.400 --> 03:33.480
This is looking real good!

03:35.820 --> 03:37.700
May I go next?

03:37.700 --> 03:39.070
Sure. Sorry!

03:43.040 --> 03:45.540
Okay, we're moving out.

03:45.830 --> 03:47.170
Yessir!

03:50.710 --> 03:52.960
So this is the training camp!

03:57.840 --> 03:59.470
You have got to chill out.

03:59.470 --> 04:02.010
I can't help it! I've never done a training camp before!

04:02.390 --> 04:07.270
What's so great about having a bunch of guys 
that smell like armpit in your face all day long?

04:07.270 --> 04:08.690
Tsukishima, you piece of shit!

04:08.690 --> 04:13.360
All air within a 500m radius of Kiyoko does not smell like armpit!

04:13.650 --> 04:18.740
Can you not tell that this air in here is as fresh and clear as the Ou Mountain spring?!

04:18.740 --> 04:20.320
I pity you.

04:20.320 --> 04:24.080
Shimizu lives nearby,
 so she goes home when the day's done.

04:29.210 --> 04:31.830
Wh-What are you guys doing?

04:31.830 --> 04:35.710
Take, it's hopeless. We're done for.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.850
Thank you for the food!

04:52.770 --> 04:54.520
Does anyone want seconds?

04:54.900 --> 04:56.320
Yes, thank you!

04:56.980 --> 04:57.490
Okay.

05:00.950 --> 05:04.080
The first-years are up next for the showers.

05:06.450 --> 05:07.950
What's up, Hinata?

05:09.830 --> 05:10.540
Some...

05:11.420 --> 05:12.790
Someone I've never seen before...

05:13.710 --> 05:15.040
is here.

05:19.010 --> 05:20.510
That's impossible.

05:21.180 --> 05:22.470
We're the only ones here today.

05:22.470 --> 05:25.300
It looked like... a child.

05:28.020 --> 05:30.690
Y-You're seeing things.

05:30.690 --> 05:33.980
You probably saw yourself in a mirror or something.

05:34.610 --> 05:36.190
You're probably right.

05:36.570 --> 05:39.190
I'm seeing things, right?

05:39.690 --> 05:40.950
Uh-huh.

05:41.570 --> 05:42.610
You're seeing things.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.280
Just seeing things.

05:51.620 --> 05:55.380
A ghost!

05:56.290 --> 05:58.090
What's all the noise?

05:58.090 --> 05:59.710
You'll make Daichi flip out!

06:00.050 --> 06:01.300
What?

06:01.300 --> 06:03.720
It's only Noya!

06:03.720 --> 06:05.850
What? It's Noya?

06:05.850 --> 06:06.930
B-But...

06:06.930 --> 06:10.430
He shrank!

06:12.020 --> 06:15.230
He's right! You're only as tall as your hair!

06:15.230 --> 06:17.110
Ryuu, you rat!

06:17.440 --> 06:19.480
Stop laughing!

06:20.690 --> 06:22.280
Keep it down.

06:22.570 --> 06:24.160
You'll make Daichi mad—

06:25.160 --> 06:27.070
It's me, Asahi!

06:27.070 --> 06:29.990
Shut up, you guys!

06:33.790 --> 06:35.750
Keep moving your legs!

06:35.750 --> 06:37.670
Stop waving your arms around!

06:37.670 --> 06:39.380
Yessir! One more!

06:42.300 --> 06:43.760
Nice, Hinata!

06:43.760 --> 06:45.220
He's completed five.

06:45.220 --> 06:47.300
Okay, that's one time around for everyone.

06:47.300 --> 06:49.350
Next up is running!

06:49.350 --> 06:50.510
Thank you!

06:51.060 --> 06:52.520
Get moving, moron.

06:51.890 --> 06:53.350
They sure are energetic.

06:52.520 --> 06:54.140
Be quiet.

06:53.350 --> 06:55.140
They even practice during their lunch break.

06:55.650 --> 06:59.110
I saw Kageyama running early in the morning too.

06:59.110 --> 07:02.110
Yeah, Hinata does that too.

07:02.110 --> 07:05.700
He said it's because he didn't have to go over the hills while he's at camp.

07:05.700 --> 07:06.570
Over the hills?

07:07.370 --> 07:09.450
That explains his stamina.

07:11.330 --> 07:12.450
Let me guess.

07:13.330 --> 07:15.620
Are you worrying about the lineup for the match?

07:16.580 --> 07:17.880
I can't decide

07:19.090 --> 07:19.840
on the setter.

07:20.590 --> 07:22.800
For raw power, I'd use Kageyama.

07:23.460 --> 07:28.800
Even though Sugawara has built up his abilities
 playing alongside the ace since he was a first-year.

07:29.680 --> 07:34.890
Kageyama has the kind of talent that can skip over that in the blink of an eye.

07:36.350 --> 07:39.560
However, because Sugawara has been playing all this time,

07:40.190 --> 07:42.980
he most likely has the trust of his teammates.

07:44.070 --> 07:47.410
Is the real reason you're having a tough time deciding

07:48.160 --> 07:51.370
due to the fact that Sugawara is in his third year of high school?

07:52.660 --> 07:57.620
Being a third-year means that this year is your last, so it's special.

07:59.380 --> 08:01.670
I'm sorry! I shouldn't interfere.

08:01.670 --> 08:04.210
No, you may be right.

08:04.920 --> 08:09.430
The only time I got to be in the starting lineup in all three years of high school

08:09.430 --> 08:13.430
was when the starting setter, who was my junior, 
couldn't play due to an injury.

08:14.140 --> 08:18.890
Back then, it was simply frustrating 
that they didn't put me in the match.

08:19.690 --> 08:22.980
But now that I've taken on a coach job, even temporarily,

08:23.730 --> 08:27.400
I can't allow myself to feel like a player.

08:35.080 --> 08:38.410
Hinata! Don't waste your breath shouting! You need that energy for later!

08:38.910 --> 08:40.330
Hey! Where are you going?!

08:48.050 --> 08:49.800
Nobody's following.

08:50.220 --> 08:52.220
Did I go the wrong way?

09:00.480 --> 09:02.310
<i>A bright red jersey.</i>

09:02.310 --> 09:04.110
<i>I've never seen one like it around here.</i>

09:04.770 --> 09:06.150
Whatcha doing?

09:06.440 --> 09:08.990
Um...

09:10.240 --> 09:11.110
I'm lost.

09:11.110 --> 09:14.070
What? Are you from another town?

09:14.070 --> 09:14.990
Yeah.

09:16.700 --> 09:18.290
Is that fun?

09:18.290 --> 09:22.250
What? Not really. This is just a time waster.

09:22.250 --> 09:23.670
Oh.

09:27.550 --> 09:28.760
Do you play volleyball?!

09:28.760 --> 09:29.380
Huh?

09:29.380 --> 09:30.670
Those shoes!

09:30.670 --> 09:31.840
They're volleyball shoes!

09:31.840 --> 09:33.390
Oh, yeah.

09:33.930 --> 09:35.300
I play volleyball too!

09:35.300 --> 09:37.430
My name's Hinata Shouyou!

09:38.970 --> 09:40.100
Kozume.

09:40.100 --> 09:41.600
Kozume? ls that your name?

09:42.900 --> 09:43.810
Kozume...

09:46.610 --> 09:47.320
Kenma.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.900
Kenma, huh?

09:48.900 --> 09:49.940
You in high school?

09:49.940 --> 09:50.570
Yeah.

09:50.570 --> 09:52.820
What year? I'm a first-year!

09:52.820 --> 09:53.610
Second.

09:53.610 --> 09:55.160
Shit! An upperclassman!

09:55.160 --> 09:56.280
I'm so sorry!

09:56.280 --> 09:57.450
It's fine.

09:57.450 --> 10:02.370
I don't really like all that sports-minded, superiority stuff.

10:02.370 --> 10:04.670
Oh, really?

10:06.210 --> 10:08.500
Um, do you like volleyball?

10:09.670 --> 10:12.260
Not really. I play it 'cause it's there.

10:12.800 --> 10:17.220
I don't mind it, I guess, but I don't like getting tired out.

10:17.640 --> 10:23.140
But a friend of mine plays it, 
and he probably needs me to play with him.

10:24.690 --> 10:27.940
I think once you start to like it, you'll find it's way more fun.

10:27.940 --> 10:29.020
That's okay.

10:29.020 --> 10:31.650
I'm only doing it for the duration of high school.

10:31.650 --> 10:32.900
What position do you play?

10:34.240 --> 10:35.110
Setter.

10:35.110 --> 10:38.700
Wow! You're nothing like our setter.

10:38.700 --> 10:42.330
Ours is a more "grr"-ing kind of guy.

10:42.330 --> 10:43.410
Oh.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.250
By the way, I'm a middle blocker!

10:46.250 --> 10:47.630
Really?

10:49.710 --> 10:51.550
Do you think that's strange too?

10:52.210 --> 10:54.590
Usually taller guys play my position.

10:54.930 --> 10:55.760
Yeah.

10:55.760 --> 10:58.100
Well, I guess so.

10:58.100 --> 10:58.800
But not really.

11:00.390 --> 11:03.520
They say stuff about me a lot when I go to matches.

11:03.520 --> 11:11.110
Like, "The setter is supposed to be the most talented person on the team, so why him?"

11:11.110 --> 11:14.860
I'm not all that athletic.

11:14.860 --> 11:16.320
I see.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.870
So, is your high school's team good?

11:19.240 --> 11:21.490
Um, I'm not so sure.

11:21.490 --> 11:25.330
They said it used to be good, but then it went downhill.

11:25.660 --> 11:27.040
But only recently...

11:28.670 --> 11:30.500
I'd say it's a pretty good team.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.090
What school do you—

11:39.090 --> 11:39.890
Kenma!

11:41.560 --> 11:42.140
Kuro.

11:43.930 --> 11:44.600
Gotta go.

11:46.390 --> 11:48.230
See you later, Shouyou.

11:48.940 --> 11:50.810
Don't wander off like that.

11:50.810 --> 11:51.440
Sorry.

11:51.440 --> 11:53.570
You don't know your way around here, so be careful.

11:54.110 --> 11:55.240
<i>"See you later"?</i>

11:59.530 --> 12:00.660
Hinata!

12:01.200 --> 12:02.620
Jeez, we've been looking for you.

12:02.620 --> 12:04.080
I'm sorry!

12:04.080 --> 12:06.080
I ran so fast, I went the wrong way.

12:07.460 --> 12:11.130
You always give every kind of practice your all.

12:11.130 --> 12:14.550
Yes, but I need more practice.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.220
I still need to improve.

12:19.260 --> 12:23.560
It's frustrating that I don't get treated like a real player without being a matched set with Kageyama.

12:24.220 --> 12:26.730
But I still want to play.

12:27.100 --> 12:29.520
I want to stand on the court.

12:34.650 --> 12:35.400
Same here.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.400
I also want to stand on the court.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.240
That's why I fight using my own methods.

12:42.490 --> 12:44.830
C'mon. You'll be late for lunch!

12:45.450 --> 12:46.370
Yessir!

12:47.200 --> 12:49.710
Miyagi Prefectural Norikizawa High School

12:50.040 --> 12:53.170
Say, isn't their setter kind of on the short side?

12:53.590 --> 12:56.380
Yeah, and he's kind of spindly.

12:56.710 --> 12:58.920
You think he's their backup setter?

12:58.920 --> 13:01.090
I've never heard of their school before.

13:03.300 --> 13:06.270
The short, spindly guy you speak of...

13:06.770 --> 13:10.480
is the spine and brain of Nekoma's team.

13:11.270 --> 13:12.900
And its heart.

13:14.150 --> 13:14.190
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

13:14.190 --> 13:14.230
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

13:14.230 --> 13:14.270

13:21.320 --> 13:28.000

13:36.050 --> 13:36.840
Mr. Ukai?

13:38.340 --> 13:39.050
What's up?

13:40.260 --> 13:43.010
Us third-years don't have a next year.

13:44.050 --> 13:47.100
That's why I want us to win as many matches as possible.

13:47.100 --> 13:49.640
I want us to get the ticket to the next match.

13:49.640 --> 13:53.480
If Kageyama is the better choice to get that ticket,

13:54.270 --> 13:56.730
then I think you should select him without hesitation.

13:58.610 --> 14:02.400
Daichi and Asahi have been playing together since they were first-years.

14:02.950 --> 14:04.620
I want to stand on the same court with them.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.580
The longer the better.

14:07.160 --> 14:11.000
If Kageyama gets tired or something unavoidable happens,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.040
even if I'm just filling a gap or subbing in,

14:13.750 --> 14:16.500
even if you pity me for being in this position despite my seniority...

14:17.170 --> 14:19.510
If it means I'll have more chances to play in matches,

14:20.090 --> 14:21.010
I'll take what I can get.

14:22.420 --> 14:26.260
Even if I'm not the starting setter, I will never give up on playing.

14:26.890 --> 14:30.310
I want to be given more chances to do that.

14:32.730 --> 14:34.480
I'm sorry for coming off so snotty.

14:35.560 --> 14:36.610
Sugawara.

14:37.820 --> 14:40.480
I believe I underestimated you.

14:40.860 --> 14:43.570
To be honest, you're freaking me out right now.

14:43.570 --> 14:44.240
What?

14:44.910 --> 14:47.450
I'm still green as an instructor,

14:48.120 --> 14:52.160
but I'll do everything I can to keep you guys on the winning track.

14:54.250 --> 14:55.460
Thank you, sir!

14:55.460 --> 14:56.040
Sure.

14:57.500 --> 15:00.380
We're gonna get motivated. 
We're going after that one extra win.

15:00.380 --> 15:01.090
Yeah.

15:01.630 --> 15:03.590
Thank you for the food!

15:05.590 --> 15:08.300
Where do you get that appetite?

15:09.140 --> 15:10.310
Hey, eat up!

15:10.310 --> 15:11.520
Force it down if you have to!

15:11.850 --> 15:14.600
How do you expect to handle the summer if you're choking right now?!

15:13.060 --> 15:15.350
You've got a healthy appetite today, Suga.

15:14.600 --> 15:15.980
You're gonna wither up and die!

15:15.350 --> 15:15.980
Really?

15:16.400 --> 15:19.820
I need to fill up so I can work my hardest!

15:17.520 --> 15:19.820
Yamaguchi, not eating that? Can I have it?

15:19.820 --> 15:22.780
Hey! Let Yamaguchi eat his own food!

15:36.460 --> 15:39.960
This is our starting order for the Nekoma match.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.960
Sawamura

15:37.370 --> 15:39.960
Sawamura

15:37.370 --> 15:39.960
Hinata

15:37.370 --> 15:39.960
Hinata

15:37.370 --> 15:39.960
Tanaka

15:37.370 --> 15:39.960
Tanaka

15:37.370 --> 15:39.960

15:37.370 --> 15:39.960

15:37.370 --> 15:39.960
Tsukishima

15:37.370 --> 15:39.960
Kageyama

15:37.370 --> 15:39.960
Kageyama

15:45.880 --> 15:48.510
You guys haven't had much time to get acquainted.

15:48.510 --> 15:51.010
I don't expect you to function with mechanical precision.

15:51.850 --> 15:57.690
Just because a hotshot libero is on the team and the ace returned, it doesn't mean that victory is a sure thing.

15:58.100 --> 15:59.690
The winner keeps the ball in play.

16:00.440 --> 16:02.730
We'll see how far this ragtag team can go.

16:02.730 --> 16:05.030
This is Crow versus its nemesis, Cat!

16:05.030 --> 16:07.820

16:05.440 --> 16:06.650
Yessir!

16:10.780 --> 16:11.990
Asahi!

16:15.830 --> 16:17.870
Setting Suga aside,

16:17.870 --> 16:20.670
don't you feel bad for Ennoshita?

16:21.210 --> 16:22.170
What?!

16:23.380 --> 16:25.380
The court is only for the strong!

16:25.380 --> 16:26.550
This is obvious!

16:27.880 --> 16:30.050
Um, Asahi?

16:30.430 --> 16:33.760
I haven't always been dedicated to the sport.

16:34.510 --> 16:36.680
I even ran away from it once.

16:36.680 --> 16:37.480
That's why.

16:37.980 --> 16:44.150
Once he becomes tougher than you in body and spirit,
 he'll take away that regular spot from you, fair and square!

16:44.150 --> 16:45.530
Right, Chikara?

16:45.530 --> 16:46.940
Don't put words in my mouth...

16:46.940 --> 16:50.450
No, wait. You'd have to take Ryuu's regular spot first!

16:50.450 --> 16:52.200
That's fine by me, scumbag!

16:52.950 --> 16:55.240
Come at me, Ennoshita, you scumbag!

16:55.240 --> 16:58.080
Nishinoya! Just stop it, okay?!

17:02.500 --> 17:04.000
All right.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.960
Hey, Ennoshita?

17:06.920 --> 17:08.510
About what you said before practice...

17:09.510 --> 17:11.180
You mean how I ran away?

17:11.930 --> 17:16.270
Did you hear about how Coach Ukai came out of retirement last year?

17:16.270 --> 17:17.140
Yes.

17:17.600 --> 17:23.860
That was when, and this is very pathetic, several of us couldn't handle the training.

17:24.520 --> 17:30.240
The sport we'd been doing for fun 
suddenly became all about winning.

17:30.240 --> 17:33.820
It was like our comfort zone was invaded, and we were all scared away.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.660
But then we wanted to play volleyball again.

17:36.660 --> 17:40.410
By the time we came back, Coach Ukai was gone.

17:41.540 --> 17:44.540
I know we're a bunch of pathetic second-years,

17:45.130 --> 17:50.220
but now that we're back, we plan to work every bit as hard as you guys.

17:50.220 --> 17:52.840
So we're counting on you all over again.

17:53.890 --> 17:54.590
Yes, sir!

18:02.310 --> 18:03.190
Mr. Takeda?

18:04.020 --> 18:05.440
Hey, are they ready?

18:05.440 --> 18:05.940
Yes.

18:06.400 --> 18:10.610
The uniforms have been cleaned and altered.

18:12.820 --> 18:14.700
I saw this on TV!

18:17.530 --> 18:18.290
Here.

18:17.950 --> 18:20.290
Hey! Noya's the only one who gets orange! That stands out!

18:18.290 --> 18:19.660
Thank you.

18:20.290 --> 18:23.370
Well, duh. That's because I'm the star!

18:23.370 --> 18:24.620
The star!

18:25.750 --> 18:29.380
During a match, the libero goes
 on and off the court many times,

18:29.380 --> 18:32.550
so his is different from the others to make it obvious, dumbass.

18:32.550 --> 18:34.510
I-I knew that!

18:34.510 --> 18:36.050
I totally knew that!

18:41.100 --> 18:43.390
K-Kageyama's is one number higher.

18:43.390 --> 18:44.850
I knew he'd say that.

18:45.310 --> 18:48.400
We're first-years, so be grateful 
that you're getting a uniform at all.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.940
I know that!

18:50.320 --> 18:51.820
I get it.

18:51.820 --> 18:53.650
He doesn't remember the number.

18:53.650 --> 18:55.820
He only saw him on TV that one time.

18:55.820 --> 18:56.620
Huh?

18:57.200 --> 19:00.290
The number worn by the Little Giant when he played at nationals

19:00.290 --> 19:01.580
was ten.

19:07.330 --> 19:09.290
Did you arrange this especially for me, Coach?

19:09.290 --> 19:10.380
No, just coincidence.

19:10.380 --> 19:11.960
Then it's destiny!

19:11.960 --> 19:13.090
It was coincidence.

19:13.470 --> 19:15.010
Don't be jealous of me, Kageyama.

19:15.010 --> 19:16.800
Why would I be jealous of you?!

19:17.140 --> 19:24.480
Incidentally, at the time Hinata's hero, the Little Giant, 
played here, Karasuno was at its best.

19:24.940 --> 19:28.020
But for all that, Karasuno didn't beat Nekoma a single time.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.150
It ended in a losing streak.

19:30.820 --> 19:32.110
I want you to clear our name.

19:32.110 --> 19:33.440
Yes, sir!

19:33.820 --> 19:36.360
Okay, now let's resume practice!

19:36.360 --> 19:37.320
Yes, sir!

19:38.070 --> 19:40.660
That must mean that Nekoma has a good team.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.870
What kind of team do they have?

19:42.870 --> 19:47.870
I don't know their current status, 
but they've always had good receivers.

19:48.420 --> 19:52.300
They never had any stand-out players, 
but they also had no holes in their defense.

19:52.300 --> 19:53.760
They're our opposite.

19:54.210 --> 19:57.010
They're called Cat for a reason.

19:57.880 --> 19:58.970
They're flexible.

20:00.430 --> 20:04.890
<i>What is this? I keep on hitting it, but it just won't land on their side of the court.</i>

20:09.020 --> 20:11.230
Nekoma        Shirato

20:09.020 --> 20:11.230
Nekoma        Shirato

20:11.730 --> 20:13.940
All right!

20:13.940 --> 20:17.900
They don't have any prodigies on attack or defense,

20:18.410 --> 20:19.950
so why are they so good?

20:26.460 --> 20:31.170
Does our fateful opponent, Karasuno, have a female manager? Yes or no?

20:31.590 --> 20:33.800
My yakisoba bun says no!

20:33.800 --> 20:35.090
What?

20:35.090 --> 20:37.840
I want them to have one, so I say yes!

20:37.840 --> 20:38.720
Same here.

20:39.010 --> 20:40.220
You idiot!

20:40.220 --> 20:43.640
We don't have one, so it would be frustrating if they did!

20:43.640 --> 20:44.680
What?

20:45.140 --> 20:49.640
What if it's far worse, and their manager is both female and beautiful?!

20:49.640 --> 20:51.690
I would never forgive that!

20:52.110 --> 20:53.400
Ever!

20:53.820 --> 20:58.110
If that time should come, 
prepare to meet your fate, Karasuno!

20:56.610 --> 20:58.110
Yamamoto, shut up!

20:58.490 --> 21:00.450
Hey, what do you think, Kenma?

21:02.160 --> 21:04.120
It wouldn't matter either way.

21:04.120 --> 21:06.120
Hmph. I knew you'd say that.

21:06.410 --> 21:07.330
But...

21:08.250 --> 21:11.670
I'm looking forward to our match with them just a little.

21:13.500 --> 21:18.340
Mr. Unenthusiastic Kenma is actually looking forward to a match?!

21:18.340 --> 21:23.390
Yamamoto, would you like me to put your excess energy to use by upping your training workload?

21:23.390 --> 21:25.600
S-Sorry, sir.

21:36.690 --> 21:37.820
Hey, Hinata.

21:38.440 --> 21:40.280
They said it's time to hit the showers.

21:42.530 --> 21:45.530
Hey, don't tense your gut and puke again.

21:45.530 --> 21:47.200
I-I'm not gonna puke!

21:48.450 --> 21:53.710
I know this is obvious, but everybody is preparing to play whether they're in the lineup or not.

21:54.960 --> 21:58.590
I'm only starting because of your sets.

21:59.260 --> 22:03.180
I hate to say it, but I bet I wouldn't be starting by myself.

22:06.640 --> 22:08.470
I'm taking my shower and going straight to bed!

22:08.470 --> 22:11.430
You piece of shit! You took a flying start!

22:13.140 --> 22:15.940
Why do they have to race just to get to the showers?

22:15.940 --> 22:17.190
Idiots.

22:18.020 --> 22:20.030
It's exhausting to watch them.

22:20.030 --> 22:23.240
Hey! Who's running?!

22:35.920 --> 22:37.090

22:52.600 --> 22:56.520

22:56.520 --> 23:00.280
I wonder if I can explain to you

23:00.780 --> 23:04.740

23:16.750 --> 23:25.340
I breathe out into the night air

23:25.340 --> 23:29.890
Countless times I swore that I would change

23:29.890 --> 23:33.890
I stumbled and fell a lot,

23:33.890 --> 23:37.850
but I swore I would laugh at the end

23:37.850 --> 23:41.780
and not let my tears go to waste

23:41.780 --> 23:45.780
There are so many dreams that can definitely come true

23:45.780 --> 23:49.780
I always sat somewhere, downcast, dejected, depressed,

23:49.780 --> 23:52.330
but still I decided I would fight,

23:52.330 --> 23:57.330
and not let all my frustration go to waste

23:57.330 --> 24:01.670
This is our revenge

24:14.520 --> 24:19.400
<i>Yeah, but it's like the match is full of guys with weird heads shaped like pudding and roosters.</i>

24:19.400 --> 24:21.560
<i>Don't worry! They're not that tall.</i>
