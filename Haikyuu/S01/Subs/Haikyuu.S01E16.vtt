00:09.450 --> 00:10.530
Yes!

00:10.530 --> 00:12.160
Nice, Hinata, Kageyama!

00:12.450 --> 00:14.620
That was so close. Shake it off, Ikejiri!

00:14.620 --> 00:15.830
Nice try!

00:18.250 --> 00:23.040
Karasuno isn't using their set and blind fast attack.

00:24.630 --> 00:30.720
In its place, although unpolished,
 they've learned to use a normal fast attack.

00:31.840 --> 00:35.600
It's sloppy, but they're also adjusting trajectory.

00:37.430 --> 00:42.060
They must have had a really productive 
practice match for it to happen this fast.

00:42.730 --> 00:45.530
They have learned their own weapons and practiced them.

00:45.530 --> 00:48.950
Now they utilize the best ones for each match.

00:50.860 --> 00:56.620
The precarious team that relied solely on power has gained wisdom.

01:00.500 --> 01:03.380
They still make a lot of basic errors.

01:01.920 --> 01:03.380
I'm sorry!

01:03.380 --> 01:07.800
Receiving skills are the one thing you can't correct overnight.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.220
Give us a nice serve, Chaya!

01:07.800 --> 01:10.010

01:09.220 --> 01:10.010
One more!

01:12.140 --> 01:13.090
Noya!

01:22.520 --> 01:24.230
All right!

01:24.230 --> 01:26.900
They're suddenly about to win the set.

01:26.900 --> 01:29.740
Their libero is going to be real trouble.

01:29.740 --> 01:35.740
Also, having that stubbled dude on their team 
allows Kageyama to use his sets more effectively.

01:37.040 --> 01:38.160
Shake it off.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.410
Come on, let's get one point and turn it around.

01:40.410 --> 01:41.410
Right.

01:42.920 --> 01:43.960
One more point!

01:45.840 --> 01:47.880
Hinata, make it count!

01:47.880 --> 01:48.590
Yes, sir!

01:49.090 --> 01:50.340
We're taking this point!

01:50.340 --> 01:51.130
Yessir!

01:57.640 --> 02:02.980

02:07.650 --> 02:14.030
I take two deep breaths and calm my heart

02:14.280 --> 02:20.700
I take a step with my left foot to break the silence

02:21.410 --> 02:27.880
Get your nervousness in check and reign in your mind

02:28.210 --> 02:31.420
You have it in you

02:31.420 --> 02:34.260
You can cast out the demons

02:35.130 --> 02:41.390
Fate? Random chance? Questions? Answers? It's all one

02:41.390 --> 02:43.680
This is the sign

02:48.020 --> 02:49.860
Oh, yeah!

02:49.860 --> 02:52.490
The world is opening to us

02:52.490 --> 02:55.530
We pass the door,

02:55.530 --> 03:01.700
look straight ahead, and never look back

03:01.700 --> 03:03.620
Oh, yeah!

03:03.620 --> 03:09.340
I put my hand to my chest

03:09.340 --> 03:15.470
I can feel the proof that I exist

03:15.470 --> 03:19.600
It is my beating heart

03:28.730 --> 03:30.690
<i>It was our biggest tournament in junior high.</i>

03:30.690 --> 03:33.190

03:33.730 --> 03:37.780
<i>But in the second round, we faced a team we didn't stand a chance against.</i>

03:38.410 --> 03:42.160
<i>Do you remember what you told our team as we were giving up?</i>

03:45.330 --> 03:47.870
We're playing against junior high schoolers just like us,

03:47.870 --> 03:49.830
so losing isn't a sure thing!

03:53.380 --> 03:54.920
We can't win unless we try!

03:55.760 --> 03:57.760
You never give up, Sawamura.

03:58.930 --> 04:00.510
I'll never give up!

04:00.510 --> 04:01.850
This is my last tournament.

04:02.510 --> 04:05.980
We're playing against junior high schoolers just like us. You've got that right!

04:05.980 --> 04:08.390
And we won in the first round for the first time!

04:09.020 --> 04:11.810
All right! We're gonna win in the second round for the first time as well!

04:11.810 --> 04:12.860
Yeah!

04:14.940 --> 04:16.150
Yes!

04:16.150 --> 04:21.700
<i>Our intentions were good, but naturally our team didn't suddenly improve.</i>

04:16.780 --> 04:19.740

Yes!

04:28.920 --> 04:30.120
Sorry, Sawamura.

04:32.340 --> 04:32.840
I'm sorry.

04:33.750 --> 04:35.170
This point will turn it around!

04:39.220 --> 04:41.680
Izumikan                        Taihaku

04:43.350 --> 04:46.390
<i>We lost, but it wasn't unexpected,</i>

04:46.930 --> 04:49.310
<i>so it didn't hurt that much.</i>

04:50.850 --> 04:56.530
<i>It even felt like a relief knowing that we wouldn't
 have to do any more painful training the next day.</i>

05:00.280 --> 05:04.080
<i>But then there was you, the only one who was suffering.</i>

05:04.830 --> 05:09.540
<i>I don't know why, but I felt a little jealous you could feel that way.</i>

05:19.170 --> 05:20.220
All right!

05:21.260 --> 05:23.430
A-Are you okay, Ikejiri?

05:24.470 --> 05:25.930
Hinata, give us a good serve!

05:26.220 --> 05:27.310
Tamagawa!

05:27.640 --> 05:29.520
Nice receive, Tamagawa!

05:30.270 --> 05:31.230
Bring it left!

05:32.020 --> 05:33.270
Ikejiri!

05:38.030 --> 05:40.740
Tokonami              Karasuno

05:38.650 --> 05:40.280
Yes!

05:45.450 --> 05:48.080
Karasuno is nothing like I've heard.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.330
They're really tough.

05:50.330 --> 05:52.370
They're on a whole other level.

05:59.340 --> 06:03.550
When the net stands between you,
 superiority doesn't matter anymore!

06:05.090 --> 06:07.850
You can't win unless you try.

06:12.980 --> 06:14.480
Uh, I mean...

06:15.270 --> 06:17.020
My friend used to say...

06:18.400 --> 06:19.440
It's starting.

06:19.440 --> 06:20.230
Right.

06:22.490 --> 06:26.280
<i>It doesn't sound persuasive coming from a guy like me! Am I stupid?!</i>

06:26.660 --> 06:28.740
<i>I've totally lost it now.</i>

06:32.750 --> 06:34.120
Give us a nice serve, Kageyama!

06:37.790 --> 06:39.130
All right!

06:38.340 --> 06:39.750
An ace!

06:39.750 --> 06:44.220
Now that they've won the first set,
 Karasuno is starting to get into the groove.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.270
All right!

06:54.560 --> 06:57.020
Karasuno       Tokonami

06:54.560 --> 06:57.020
Karasuno       Tokonami

06:57.770 --> 06:58.730
<i>Shit!</i>

07:02.900 --> 07:04.110

07:04.780 --> 07:05.490
<i>It's high!</i>

07:20.630 --> 07:21.170

07:21.170 --> 07:23.670

07:23.670 --> 07:27.890
Karasuno                         Tokonami

07:24.090 --> 07:26.630
Aren't we going a little overboard over one point?

07:26.630 --> 07:27.890
That's how it should be.

07:27.890 --> 07:30.510
This is the kind of point that turns the tide!

07:31.180 --> 07:32.100
Guys.

07:33.310 --> 07:35.770
We can't win unless we try, right?

07:35.770 --> 07:37.440
We'll be tenacious!

07:37.440 --> 07:40.060
A small-time team knows how to hang in there!

07:40.060 --> 07:41.400
Let's go for the win!

07:42.360 --> 07:43.070
Yeah!

07:46.320 --> 07:47.110
Aya!

07:48.950 --> 07:50.320
Yui, get it!

07:50.320 --> 07:51.080
Right!

07:53.120 --> 07:53.830
Let it go!

07:55.120 --> 07:56.960
Yes!

07:56.960 --> 07:58.080
Nice judgment call!

07:58.080 --> 08:02.380
L, U, C, K, Y! L, U, C, K, Y! Lucky!

08:00.040 --> 08:02.380

08:09.050 --> 08:11.050
Even if you're not sure you can win,

08:11.800 --> 08:14.520
or everyone around you says you don't stand a chance,

08:14.930 --> 08:16.020
we can't...

08:21.860 --> 08:24.650
<i>We can't allow ourselves to say that!</i>

08:25.480 --> 08:26.400
Give us a good serve!

08:26.400 --> 08:27.570
Go!

08:27.570 --> 08:28.530
Aya!

08:31.120 --> 08:32.530
We did it!

08:33.200 --> 08:35.290
Shake it off, Aya! You almost had it!

08:35.290 --> 08:38.250
You could've retrieved that, Yui.

08:38.250 --> 08:38.960
What?

08:38.960 --> 08:42.960
I'm sorry! I've messed up so many balls!

08:45.760 --> 08:47.920
Reflect on the match after it's over.

08:49.470 --> 08:50.930
Now, stand up.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.340
This isn't over yet!

08:55.560 --> 08:57.140
All right!

09:00.480 --> 09:02.520
<i>Match point, fully in Karasuno's favor.</i>

09:03.440 --> 09:07.490
<i>For them, it won't hurt in the least if they lose this point.</i>

09:09.110 --> 09:10.110
<i>But for us...</i>

09:10.740 --> 09:12.070
<i>One more point.</i>

09:12.740 --> 09:14.700
<i>It isn't over!</i>

09:15.740 --> 09:17.700
<i>Come and get us, Karasuno!</i>

<i>This isn't over yet!</i>

09:37.600 --> 09:38.060

09:57.370 --> 09:59.080
Right on!

09:59.080 --> 10:00.790
You pieces of shit!

10:02.870 --> 10:04.710
I'll retrieve the next one!

10:05.670 --> 10:07.630
We're gonna get that point back!

10:07.630 --> 10:08.590
Yeah!

10:11.590 --> 10:13.130

10:15.800 --> 10:21.140

10:53.720 --> 10:54.470
We won.

10:55.680 --> 10:56.260
Yeah.

10:57.180 --> 11:01.100
Does that mean we get another match?

11:02.430 --> 11:04.480
Yeah, 'cause we won.

11:05.640 --> 11:06.560
We won.

We won.

We can stay on the court!

11:19.490 --> 11:20.450
For another match!

11:22.240 --> 11:24.620
The tiny beast, so hungry for victory,

11:25.040 --> 11:27.630
has had his very first taste.

11:27.630 --> 11:28.500
Yeah.

11:29.960 --> 11:34.800
Are these guys fully aware they have
 another match to play this afternoon?

11:35.720 --> 11:41.140
It's just that victory was a sure thing, so they should've kept as much energy in reserve as possible.

11:41.140 --> 11:42.220
What's so bad about it?

11:42.770 --> 11:44.850
We got to see them play for keeps.

11:44.850 --> 11:47.350
But they didn't use the deviant fast attack.

11:48.350 --> 11:50.520
The other match is also over.

11:50.520 --> 11:52.070
Date Tech won by a landslide.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.900
Karasuno vs. Date Tech.

11:54.900 --> 11:56.780
Who will rise to the top?

11:57.660 --> 11:58.660
Let's go.

11:58.660 --> 12:01.620

12:13.380 --> 12:17.130
I can't help it. They went after my serves.

12:17.130 --> 12:19.180
They took so many points because of me.

12:23.220 --> 12:25.430
Volleyball is about keeping the ball in play after that!

12:25.430 --> 12:28.190
Our opponents were better at it 
than we were! That's why we lost.

12:28.520 --> 12:30.350
The blame doesn't fall on any one person!

12:32.440 --> 12:34.900

12:34.900 --> 12:35.900
Right!

12:35.900 --> 12:37.150

12:43.030 --> 12:45.830
Michimiya is incredible.

12:46.080 --> 12:50.080
She practiced the most, 
so why isn't she taking it the hardest?

12:50.080 --> 12:50.870
She is.

12:50.870 --> 12:51.540
What?

12:52.380 --> 12:56.260
She keeps up a strong front when she's with us.

12:56.550 --> 12:59.090
Is the next match after that one?

12:57.210 --> 13:00.720
She'll wait until she's alone.

<i>but I was half serious when I said I'd be representing Japan in the future.</i>

13:37.800 --> 13:40.720
<i>But the moment it came down to boring resistance training,</i>

13:40.720 --> 13:42.430

<i>If only I'd worked a little harder at the resistance training and running...</i>

<i>If only I'd been more of a captain...</i>

14:03.030 --> 14:06.620
<i>If only I'd been a little more desperate to make one more receive...</i>

14:07.080 --> 14:10.330
<i>If only I'd gotten in one more step...</i>

14:11.500 --> 14:16.420
<i>Would I have gotten to play volleyball just a little longer?</i>

14:23.680 --> 14:24.510
Sawamura!

14:27.810 --> 14:28.850
Ikejiri?

14:38.570 --> 14:39.570
Win!

14:39.570 --> 14:40.730
You have to keep winning!

14:41.360 --> 14:42.780
Win for us too!

14:53.460 --> 14:54.040
Sure.

14:54.710 --> 14:56.040
Challenge accepted!

15:00.420 --> 15:06.890
<i>Tens of thousands of players nationwide are probably 
going through the same match-ending disappointment.</i>

15:07.890 --> 15:12.520
<i>To get to nationals, they have to win every single preliminary match.</i>

15:14.060 --> 15:15.980
<i>If this were a work of fiction,</i>

15:16.730 --> 15:19.270
<i>the guys going to nationals would be the main characters,</i>

15:19.270 --> 15:22.440
<i>and we would be like the fill-in characters.</i>

15:23.780 --> 15:24.740
<i>But so what?</i>

15:58.940 --> 16:00.770
<i>We were a part of that.</i>

16:03.110 --> 16:04.820
<i>We were a part of that.</i>

16:07.110 --> 16:08.280
<i>Volleyball.</i>

16:29.050 --> 16:29.090
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

16:29.090 --> 16:29.130

16:52.070 --> 16:54.120
Karasuno was incredible.

16:54.120 --> 16:56.580
Their tiny number ten really freaked me out!

16:56.580 --> 16:58.160
Yeah, that's for sure.

16:58.160 --> 17:00.580
He was totally nailing those fast attacks.

17:03.590 --> 17:07.260
Wh-What? I'm allowed to be happy!

17:07.260 --> 17:09.800
No one's ever said that kind of stuff about me before.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.550
Did I say anything?

17:14.550 --> 17:17.850
It's great that you're getting noticed.

17:18.180 --> 17:22.190
The more our opponents notice you and get defensive around you,

17:22.190 --> 17:24.270
the more you can tap into your potential.

17:26.070 --> 17:30.240
I'm not sure what you're saying, 
but for now, your smile terrifies me.

17:32.450 --> 17:33.870
Ow!

17:33.870 --> 17:35.700
Yeah, he's right.

17:35.990 --> 17:40.290
Anyway, "that tiny number ten" will set an excellent mood.

17:40.290 --> 17:42.290
The brighter the mood is,

17:42.790 --> 17:46.800
and the more Hinata shines, the more it will blind the opponent blockers.

17:48.880 --> 17:53.720
We'll be using the same starting lineup for round two as we did for round one.

17:59.140 --> 18:01.480
The next match is at 1:30 PM.

18:01.480 --> 18:02.940
Don't let yourselves cool down.

18:02.940 --> 18:04.650
Have a light meal before that time.

18:05.020 --> 18:06.690
Don't fill up!

18:06.690 --> 18:07.860
Yessir!

18:09.610 --> 18:13.030
Our next match is against No Brow's Iron Wall high school.

18:13.280 --> 18:14.700
That's Date Tech.

18:14.700 --> 18:15.740
I knew that!

18:17.450 --> 18:20.950
I think that the match Karasuno lost to Date Tech in March

18:21.580 --> 18:23.870
is the reason why Azumane quit the team.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.170
Really?

18:27.170 --> 18:31.840
<i>There was a match in which the opposition blocked all of his spikes.</i>

18:33.630 --> 18:37.600
Blockers that can completely stop Asahi from scoring.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.470
Hinata, Kageyama.

18:40.640 --> 18:41.730
Have you got a minute?

18:45.060 --> 18:45.690
Asahi.

18:48.020 --> 18:49.110
We should get going.

18:52.570 --> 18:53.820
I'm counting on you.

18:57.120 --> 18:59.240
Date Tech is a strong opponent.

18:59.240 --> 19:03.250
Three months ago, they thrashed us good with their Iron Wall block.

19:04.660 --> 19:07.290
But now we have our greatest decoy!

19:10.590 --> 19:13.380
You blazed a trail for Hinata to use.

19:14.630 --> 19:18.720
Now, I want you to blaze a path for our ace, Asahi!

19:27.100 --> 19:31.980
All right! We're gonna win round two as well!

19:39.490 --> 19:49.630
Go, go, let's go! Let's go, Date Tech!

19:42.660 --> 19:49.630
<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

19:42.660 --> 19:49.630
<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

19:49.630 --> 19:52.590
Date Tech, fight!

19:52.960 --> 19:54.550
Yeah!

19:54.550 --> 19:56.170
Running!

19:57.970 --> 20:00.010
Those guys sure keep busy with scare tactics!

20:00.010 --> 20:01.930
Date Tech scares me.

20:01.930 --> 20:04.640
They'd overwhelm anyone sharing the same court.

20:04.640 --> 20:10.230
I felt so bad for the spiker on the team they played in the first round.

20:10.230 --> 20:14.230
It was like they literally won't cut any slack for anyone.

20:15.440 --> 20:16.150
Captains!

20:17.360 --> 20:18.860
Let's have a good match.

20:18.860 --> 20:22.330
<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

20:18.860 --> 20:22.330
<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

20:21.160 --> 20:26.330
It's like the entire stadium wants Date Tech to win.

20:26.330 --> 20:28.580
We're receiving first.

20:28.580 --> 20:29.620
We're on this side.

20:29.620 --> 20:30.290
Right.

20:30.580 --> 20:32.130
Warm up! Receiving!

20:32.130 --> 20:33.040
Yessir!

20:33.040 --> 20:35.090
Let's do this! Keep it in play!

20:35.090 --> 20:35.710
Yessir!

20:36.590 --> 20:40.180
<i>It's been three months since we lost in straight sets to Date Tech.</i>

20:41.550 --> 20:49.350
<i>The team is definitely evolving, but the image of losing may linger in the heads of the upperclassmen.</i>

20:50.060 --> 20:54.610
<i>For now, we need to do something about this intimidating atmosphere.</i>

20:55.530 --> 20:57.280
Rolling...

20:58.700 --> 21:00.780
Thunder...

21:00.780 --> 21:02.120
Again!

21:11.830 --> 21:12.920
Nailed it.

21:13.380 --> 21:15.250
Noya, nice receive!

21:15.250 --> 21:17.840
You're totally sharp! Aside from the name.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.760
The name is sharp too!

21:19.760 --> 21:22.140
Teach it to me! Teach me how to do the "Again"!

21:22.510 --> 21:24.220
Was that different from the last one?

21:24.220 --> 21:26.010
What was that?

21:24.220 --> 21:26.010
Just receive it normally.

21:26.010 --> 21:27.770
Nishinoya's up to it again.

21:27.770 --> 21:31.100
Psst, Nishinoya! Daichi will get mad at you again.

21:31.600 --> 21:34.810
All right! We've got nothing to worry about!

21:35.860 --> 21:37.820
You guys focus on what's in front!

21:38.530 --> 21:41.320
I've got your backs.

21:44.620 --> 21:45.580
Th...

21:45.580 --> 21:47.540
That's so cool!

21:50.500 --> 21:52.460
That's so cool.

21:54.790 --> 21:56.000
I'll be dammed!

21:56.000 --> 21:58.670
It looks like everyone's in the usual frame of mind now.

21:58.670 --> 21:59.590
Yeah.

22:00.340 --> 22:03.470
<i>For all that stature, he's incredibly reliable.</i>

22:04.220 --> 22:05.720
<i>A libero not only defends the team.</i>

22:05.720 --> 22:10.600
<i>Another vital part of the job is to support the team from behind the scenes.</i>

22:11.390 --> 22:13.560
He really is an excellent libero.
