00:03.400 --> 00:04.030
<i>That's heavy!</i>

00:10.780 --> 00:11.620
It's up!

00:11.620 --> 00:12.620
Nice save!

00:13.030 --> 00:16.080
So please, call for a set just one more time...

00:16.080 --> 00:17.540
ace!

00:18.870 --> 00:19.460
Shimada!

00:19.460 --> 00:23.130
Suga!

00:24.630 --> 00:26.090
One more!

00:26.510 --> 00:27.550
Asahi!

00:46.900 --> 00:48.740
What a sound!

00:48.740 --> 00:50.360
It went ka-doom!

00:50.360 --> 00:52.570
Nice! Good job, Asahi!

00:52.570 --> 00:53.450
You too, Nishinoya!

00:54.240 --> 00:57.410
You guys too. Nice set, Suga.

00:57.410 --> 00:59.580
Nishinoya, nice receive.

01:04.880 --> 01:07.380
That's the ace.

01:08.670 --> 01:09.380
Hey.

01:10.300 --> 01:12.930
You're the one who wanted to see the ace.

01:12.930 --> 01:14.260
Don't freak out!

01:14.260 --> 01:15.890
I-I'm not freaking out!

01:16.430 --> 01:21.230
I don't have his height or power, but I can fight too.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.480
I'll be him next!

01:23.980 --> 01:23.980
{OP}

01:28.610 --> 01:30.820
The heat flickers

01:30.820 --> 01:33.160
Sweat glitters on my skin

01:33.160 --> 01:38.040
Shouts echo and shoulders hit

01:38.040 --> 01:42.710
We asked the sky through the open window

01:38.160 --> 01:44.210
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

01:39.040 --> 01:44.210

Tell me, Mr. Future

01:48.800 --> 01:50.550
Come on, come on, come on

01:50.550 --> 01:53.130
The chance is there

01:53.550 --> 01:55.140
Come on, come on, come on

01:55.140 --> 01:57.310
Do it together

01:59.220 --> 02:03.810
Everybody always wants to stand there,

02:03.810 --> 02:08.520
make mistakes, get angry, and struggle

02:08.520 --> 02:09.860
We'll never give up

02:09.860 --> 02:13.320
We don't want it to end

02:13.320 --> 02:18.830
I will continue on with my imagination

02:20.330 --> 02:25.040
I want to struggle and fall and become stronger

02:25.040 --> 02:29.800
I want to persevere, stand back up, do it again,

02:29.800 --> 02:31.090
and never give up

02:31.090 --> 02:34.380
Let me run

02:34.380 --> 02:40.220
I will run to where my imagination leads me

02:54.030 --> 02:54.030
{Part A}

02:56.490 --> 02:59.740
<i>The width of a hand is approximately 2 cm.</i>

03:00.200 --> 03:04.000
<i>My hands are slightly smaller than anyone in my own age group.</i>

03:05.670 --> 03:09.290
<i>The 2 cm between the ball and the floor...</i>

03:12.880 --> 03:14.340
<i>can keep the ace...</i>

03:16.010 --> 03:17.140
<i>alive.</i>

03:18.850 --> 03:21.100
You can't jump worth a damn!

03:19.140 --> 03:23.100
Episode Ten:
The Dream

03:19.140 --> 03:23.100
Episode Ten:
The Dream

03:21.560 --> 03:23.060
Skipping practice for a month will do that!

03:23.060 --> 03:25.560
Yeah. I'm sorry.

03:25.560 --> 03:27.060
Harsh, Nishinoya.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.520
Daichi!

03:29.520 --> 03:30.570
Yeah!

03:31.520 --> 03:36.240
If Asahi is back and we're facing both him and this veteran team,

03:36.240 --> 03:38.530
we're gonna have trouble winning this.

03:40.700 --> 03:44.500
What're you talking about, Daichi? You've got me on your siâ€”

03:43.080 --> 03:44.500
You've got me on your side!

03:44.790 --> 03:45.960
Huh? What?

03:45.960 --> 03:48.170
Hinata, butt out!

03:48.170 --> 03:51.500
You've ruined my awesome speech, you idiot!

03:52.300 --> 03:54.010
That was great!

03:54.010 --> 03:55.670
And Nishinoya's receive was awesome!

03:55.670 --> 03:59.390
If we can retrieve blocked balls, we have nothing to fear!

03:59.390 --> 04:01.050
As if.

04:01.050 --> 04:03.470
He can't retrieve those all the time.

04:03.470 --> 04:03.930
Huh?

04:04.430 --> 04:10.270
The ball plummets down at a speed of 
100 km/h from just 2 or 3 meters away.

04:10.270 --> 04:12.770
There's no way he can retrieve every one.

04:13.110 --> 04:14.110
Right.

04:14.110 --> 04:20.410
The important thing is to get it into their heads that a blocked ball isn't the end of the world.

04:20.410 --> 04:23.490
I'm gonna retrieve 'em like crazy, so please keep getting blocked!

04:21.410 --> 04:26.950
You get a whole new frame of mind once you know you've got teammates backing you up.

04:23.490 --> 04:24.290
What?

04:24.290 --> 04:26.950
Nah, an ace will score every time.

04:26.950 --> 04:28.120
I see!

04:26.950 --> 04:28.120
What?!

04:28.120 --> 04:30.000
Karasuno        Neighborhood Assoc.

04:28.120 --> 04:30.000
Karasuno        Neighborhood Assoc.

04:28.540 --> 04:30.000
Give us a good one!

04:30.500 --> 04:31.210
Ennoshita!

04:32.630 --> 04:33.290
Cover it!

04:33.290 --> 04:36.510
<i>On the whole, their receives still need work.</i>

04:33.960 --> 04:36.510
Sorry, Kageyama. Cover it!

04:36.800 --> 04:37.550
Got it!

04:37.920 --> 04:41.510
<i>He quickly and decisively gauges distance and the point of impact.</i>

04:41.800 --> 04:43.970
<i>If I remember correctly, this setter is a first-year.</i>

04:44.310 --> 04:46.640
<i>The question is, which one will I put in the lineâ€”</i>

04:51.850 --> 04:53.610
Nice, Hinata, Kageyama!

04:53.610 --> 04:55.320
Thank you!

04:56.280 --> 05:00.070
But now, with this guy setting for me, I can evade any block, no matter how high it may be.

05:00.660 --> 05:03.780
He wasn't exaggerating.

05:03.780 --> 05:06.040
That's amazing, Shouyou!

05:06.040 --> 05:08.700
What was that?! I couldn't help but watch!

05:11.000 --> 05:15.290
<i>They didn't make any kind of visible or vocal signal, so how?!</i>

05:17.380 --> 05:18.260
Boy!

05:19.800 --> 05:21.880
Why did you jump over there just now, Peewee?!

05:21.880 --> 05:22.840
Peewee?

05:23.930 --> 05:27.350
B-Because the set will come to me no matter where I am... sir.

05:28.930 --> 05:32.980
<i>It's obvious the peewee jumped without looking for the set.</i>

05:33.810 --> 05:38.690
<i>Does this first-year setter completely adapt to the peewee's every action?!</i>

05:39.240 --> 05:42.070
<i>And how can he be so sure that the set will come to him?!</i>

05:42.660 --> 05:46.620
<i>Does anyone in their right mind go all-out on a set without looking?!</i>

05:47.830 --> 05:49.620
What are you guys, deviants?!

05:50.710 --> 05:51.870
Deviants?

05:52.620 --> 05:53.330
How come?

05:53.330 --> 05:54.460
Beats me.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.170
Tsukishima, wipe that grin off your face!

05:56.290 --> 05:59.880
I have no idea what they were discussing before the match...

06:01.260 --> 06:04.300
<i>I hid in the shadow of Kageyama's overwhelming talent.</i>

06:05.140 --> 06:07.430
<i>It was comfortable there.</i>

06:07.890 --> 06:11.480
That first-year setter has to be what they call a prodigy.

06:09.390 --> 06:11.480
Hinata, we're gonna nail another.

06:11.480 --> 06:12.310
Right!

06:11.480 --> 06:14.770
Normal mortals pale in comparison to him.

06:14.020 --> 06:14.770
You can do this!

06:15.150 --> 06:15.900
However...

06:18.400 --> 06:19.980
Ooh, a straight spike.

06:19.980 --> 06:23.820
God damn, his timing is bang-on even after being out for a month!

06:23.820 --> 06:25.320
Tanaka, you're too happy.

06:26.030 --> 06:28.530
The one breath between the set and the spike.

06:29.200 --> 06:33.410
It can only be achieved over time with lots of training.

06:33.830 --> 06:34.370
Yes!

06:34.710 --> 06:38.840
Their bond of trust cannot be built in a day.

06:39.250 --> 06:43.130
So if the first-year setter's weapon is overwhelming talent,

06:43.130 --> 06:45.800
then that means his weapon is
 accumulated trust and consistency.

06:51.640 --> 06:52.770
I got it!

06:53.730 --> 06:55.810
Karasuno ain't such a bad team!

06:56.980 --> 06:59.520
You should've told me sooner, teach.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.860
I did tell you, many times.

07:04.820 --> 07:07.780
Karasuno        Neighborhood Assoc.

07:04.820 --> 07:07.780
Karasuno        Neighborhood Assoc.

07:05.280 --> 07:06.530
Yes!

07:07.160 --> 07:11.240
Who'd have thought that Peewee could be a middle blocker?

07:11.580 --> 07:14.910
His fast attacks are impressive, but how does he block?

07:18.420 --> 07:20.630
<i>I'm being watched.</i>

07:20.960 --> 07:25.880
That's right! This match is Hinata's showdown against his dream ace.

07:25.880 --> 07:26.760
Huh?

07:26.760 --> 07:33.390
You see, Hinata enrolled in Karasuno because he wants to be just like the ace they called "The Little Giant."

07:33.390 --> 07:35.600
Who, him?

07:36.640 --> 07:40.270
So that's why he tries so hard. He says he's gonna be the ace.

07:40.900 --> 07:45.440
For Hinata, this is his big face-off against the current ace of Karasuno.

07:45.440 --> 07:47.910
Really? That sounds fun.

07:47.910 --> 07:50.530
Although it's more like man versus junior high school student.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.120
<i>Straight.</i>

07:55.830 --> 07:59.000
<i>Right now, I'm marking the ace.</i>

07:59.380 --> 08:01.960
<i>I'm fighting against the ace of Karasuno!</i>

08:01.960 --> 08:03.170
Give us a good serve!

08:04.550 --> 08:06.050
Nice receive!

08:08.470 --> 08:10.680
<i>A split-second later, he's right in front of me!</i>

08:16.810 --> 08:20.020
Karasuno        Neighborhood Assoc.

08:16.810 --> 08:20.020
Karasuno        Neighborhood Assoc.

08:17.690 --> 08:23.190
I was aware of how high he could jump, 
but it's more impressive when he's at eye level.

08:20.020 --> 08:21.440
I'm sorry!

08:21.440 --> 08:22.270
Shake it off!

08:22.270 --> 08:23.650
You almost had it.

08:23.190 --> 08:25.480
How high is the guy jumping?

08:23.650 --> 08:25.030
Save it for next time!

08:25.030 --> 08:25.480
Yes, sir!

08:27.570 --> 08:31.490
He's amazing, and he hasn't played for a month!

08:29.030 --> 08:30.740
Not bad, Asahi.

08:31.490 --> 08:34.790
You're holding your hands wrong when you block!

08:34.790 --> 08:37.370
This is how you block! Like this!

08:38.460 --> 08:40.500
Are you listening? Like this!

08:40.500 --> 08:41.960
Get the next one too.

08:41.130 --> 08:41.960
Hey!

08:46.590 --> 08:53.100
<i>He was sweaty and hurting, 
but the Little Giant never stopped jumping.</i>

08:53.600 --> 08:56.180
<i>I didn't really understand it at the time,</i>

08:56.180 --> 09:01.100
<i>but now I think that's what it means to have the faith of your teammates.</i>

08:58.600 --> 09:00.560
I'm counting on you, Asahi.

09:01.770 --> 09:05.730
<i>Everyone on the team believed that he could score the point,</i>

09:05.730 --> 09:09.070
<i>so they all worked to get the ball to their little ace.</i>

09:09.530 --> 09:12.780
<i>I'm sure that it's the same for Asahi.</i>

09:14.450 --> 09:14.870
Heyâ€”

09:14.870 --> 09:16.160
The ace is amazing!

09:16.830 --> 09:20.830
It doesn't matter if they're blocking or not, 'cause he can blast through 'em anyway!

09:22.920 --> 09:23.750
What is it?

09:24.710 --> 09:25.630
Nothing.

09:27.920 --> 09:30.130
Neighborhood Assoc.       Karasuno

09:27.920 --> 09:30.130
Neighborhood Assoc.       Karasuno

09:28.630 --> 09:29.220
Cover it!

09:29.220 --> 09:30.130
Forward!

09:30.470 --> 09:31.340
Left!

09:31.880 --> 09:35.470
<i>If I had his height and power, I could be like him.</i>

09:32.640 --> 09:35.140
The left is coming! Firm up defense!

09:35.140 --> 09:37.520
Hinata, go further back!

09:35.470 --> 09:39.600
<i>No, the Little Giant was amazing for his size.</i>

09:39.600 --> 09:40.270
<i>Still...</i>

09:43.980 --> 09:45.440
<i>I wish.</i>

09:45.440 --> 09:46.480
Hinata!

09:59.120 --> 10:00.000
Hinata?

10:02.540 --> 10:03.460
Hey, he's alive.

10:03.460 --> 10:04.420
You okay?

10:04.420 --> 10:06.920
You okay?! I'm so sorry!

10:05.040 --> 10:08.380
Any way you slice it, it's his fault for standing there like a putz.

10:08.380 --> 10:11.590
F-F-F-First aid...

10:10.130 --> 10:11.590
Calm down, teach.

10:12.970 --> 10:14.640
I'm all right. I'm sorry.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.720
Really?! Maybe you should sit out to be on the safe side.

10:16.720 --> 10:18.350
I-I'm really all right!

10:18.350 --> 10:21.060
I didn't dodge it in time, that's all. It's nothing serious.

10:21.060 --> 10:23.020
I'm used to taking it in the face.

10:23.020 --> 10:24.140
That's not a good thing.

10:36.620 --> 10:39.790
Why were you daydreaming during a match?

10:44.870 --> 10:49.210
<i>Crap. Kageyama isn't shouting, which means he's really mad.</i>

10:49.210 --> 10:52.130
<i>It's like the time I served the ball into the back of his head.</i>

10:52.130 --> 10:53.510
I know what you're thinking.

10:55.340 --> 10:57.340
Being an ace is cool.

10:57.340 --> 11:00.930
Being a decoy can't be my best weapon. That's stupid and lame.

11:01.520 --> 11:05.980
You wish you were as tall and powerful as Azumane so you could be the ace!

11:06.810 --> 11:08.980
I-I don't think that!

11:09.770 --> 11:12.440
Most of the time.

11:14.070 --> 11:19.490
Now that you know there's an ace, you not only dream about being him, you're jealous of him!

11:22.410 --> 11:25.040
Clear your head of that kind of garbage during a match!

11:27.630 --> 11:31.170
What's wrong with being jealous?

11:31.670 --> 11:34.880
You've always been tall, 
so you could never know what it's like!

11:37.640 --> 11:38.470
Hey!

11:38.470 --> 11:40.300
Hey, you. Volleyball team.

11:40.680 --> 11:43.770
It's time to shut it down. You need to put this away.

11:44.100 --> 11:46.560
I'm sorry! We need to finish this match.

11:46.560 --> 11:47.730
But it's late.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.190
I'll be responsible for locking it up.

11:52.610 --> 11:55.150
<i>It's my fault the match got interrupted.</i>

11:55.740 --> 11:57.700
<i>And I made Kageyama shout at me.</i>

11:58.910 --> 11:59.780
All right.

11:59.780 --> 12:01.080
Thanks for putting up with me.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.660
Sir, I'm sorry!

12:03.950 --> 12:05.120
Thank you so much.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.790
Take, that's bitchin'!

12:07.790 --> 12:10.170
Okay, let's resume the match!

12:10.170 --> 12:11.460
Yessir!

12:11.460 --> 12:13.920
Neighborhood Assoc.       Karasuno

12:11.460 --> 12:13.920
Neighborhood Assoc.       Karasuno

12:11.960 --> 12:12.800
Let's score!

12:12.800 --> 12:13.920
Give us a good one!

12:13.920 --> 12:16.510
Okay, I'm ready for you.

12:16.510 --> 12:21.550
Hey, this is the most powerful attack rotation for the high schooler team.

12:22.180 --> 12:24.560
We have to watch out for the short guy's fast attack.

12:24.560 --> 12:25.100
Right.

12:25.100 --> 12:26.100
Excuse me.

12:28.940 --> 12:31.400
My next set will be to him.

12:31.980 --> 12:33.730
Please block him as best you can.

12:35.110 --> 12:35.150
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:35.150 --> 12:35.190
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:35.190 --> 12:35.230
<b>Haikyuu !!</b>

12:35.190 --> 12:35.230

12:35.230 --> 12:35.280

12:35.230 --> 12:35.280

12:42.280 --> 12:49.000

12:49.920 --> 12:52.540
My next set will be to him.

12:52.540 --> 12:54.090
Please block him as best you can.

12:55.420 --> 12:57.340
What's this, a dare?

12:57.340 --> 12:59.430
Yes, it's a dare.

12:59.430 --> 13:01.140
Forgive me for acting like a snot.

13:03.100 --> 13:05.180
You're a funny guy!

13:05.970 --> 13:08.140
Okay! Let's do this dare!

13:08.680 --> 13:09.850
Thank you!

13:15.650 --> 13:17.030
What is he thinking?

13:17.360 --> 13:21.200
Fast attacks are effective because they're unpredictable.

13:21.200 --> 13:26.240
There's no way Peewee can take a
 head-on block with the cards on the table.

13:26.870 --> 13:27.750
You're right.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.830
We've gotta stop them.

13:28.450 --> 13:31.960
I would have to agree, if he took them head-on.

13:29.830 --> 13:31.960
Yeah! We can't let them make monkeys of us.

13:32.370 --> 13:34.670
<i>What's that idiot thinking?</i>

13:34.670 --> 13:37.630
<i>Why tell them our next attack?</i>

13:38.380 --> 13:42.090
<i>I can't spike through their huge blockers!</i>

13:42.470 --> 13:43.510
Right now,

13:44.640 --> 13:48.720
you're nothing but a klutzy shit who happens to be nimble and can jump high.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.690
You will never be the breadwinner ace.

13:52.940 --> 13:53.600
Hey.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.980
J-Just a minute.

13:54.980 --> 13:55.810
But...

13:56.900 --> 13:58.860
as long as I'm around, you're the greatest!

13:58.860 --> 13:59.570
Huh?

14:00.740 --> 14:05.280
Azumane's spikes are so forceful, he can cut through a triple block.

14:05.280 --> 14:08.370
Uh, but not every time. I, uh...

14:08.370 --> 14:09.540
You're getting too flustered.

14:09.540 --> 14:11.410
Now how about you?

14:11.410 --> 14:15.540
When I set for you, have you ever been stopped by blockers?

14:18.960 --> 14:19.880
Give us a good serve!

14:20.300 --> 14:21.220
Got it!

14:21.220 --> 14:22.720
Nice receive!

14:23.430 --> 14:24.890
<i>The blockers are too tall!</i>

14:24.890 --> 14:25.590
Go around!

14:26.850 --> 14:29.010
What else can you do, you moron?!

14:31.060 --> 14:32.430
<i>If I can't break through...</i>

14:33.560 --> 14:34.140
<i>go around!</i>

14:39.780 --> 14:41.400
<i>I hate being blocked.</i>

14:41.400 --> 14:42.990
<i>I hate being stopped!</i>

14:45.240 --> 14:48.990
<i>I don't stand a chance of winning with blockers in front of me.</i>

14:49.790 --> 14:52.160
<i>I can't take them on the same way the ace does.</i>

14:54.210 --> 14:55.040
<i>But...</i>

14:57.080 --> 14:58.290
<i>As long as I'm around...</i>

15:01.880 --> 15:04.260
<i>you're the greatest!</i>

15:12.980 --> 15:14.520
You aren't the ace!

15:15.100 --> 15:20.150
But with your speed and jumping ability 
and my sets, you can take on any blockers!

15:20.770 --> 15:22.610
The ace blasts through for a point.

15:22.940 --> 15:24.820
You go around for a point.

15:25.820 --> 15:27.030
A point is a point!

15:27.610 --> 15:29.780
You don't need the ace's crown.

15:29.780 --> 15:32.870
You can hammer out more points than anyone!

15:32.870 --> 15:39.670
That's why, thanks to your decoy skills, our opponents will be marking you, freeing up our other spikers!

15:39.670 --> 15:40.750
Including the ace!

15:41.500 --> 15:42.420
Right?!

15:42.420 --> 15:43.210
Yeah?

15:43.210 --> 15:45.220
Yeah, listen to him!

15:45.220 --> 15:50.430
Your decoy work drastically affects our success rate.

15:50.430 --> 15:54.850
Do you still believe that your job is uncool?!

16:07.280 --> 16:08.530
I don't.

16:08.530 --> 16:09.240
What?!

16:11.200 --> 16:12.160
I don't!

16:13.540 --> 16:14.160
Good!

16:20.210 --> 16:22.250
That last hit was incredible.

16:24.630 --> 16:27.260
I'm sorry for interrupting our practice match!

16:27.260 --> 16:29.180
Uh, sure.

16:28.050 --> 16:29.180
I'm sorry!

16:29.890 --> 16:32.390
Please continue the match, sir!

16:31.300 --> 16:32.390
Sir!

16:32.720 --> 16:34.930
Okay, we're gonna seriously catch up!

16:34.930 --> 16:35.390
Right!

16:37.770 --> 16:38.980
Teach?

16:38.980 --> 16:43.940
Just because you happened to nail that one, don't keep jumping in the same direction.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.100
About those two...

16:41.100 --> 16:43.440
Do you mean Hinata and Kageyama?

16:44.360 --> 16:48.490
Are they from the same junior high? Or the same grade school?

16:48.490 --> 16:48.900
Huh?

16:49.400 --> 16:52.990
Not at all. Those two only just met.

16:52.990 --> 16:55.830
It was a real mess at first because they didn't get along.

16:57.330 --> 16:58.580
Ukai?

16:59.750 --> 17:01.120
That's cruel.

17:02.290 --> 17:03.710
Yeah!

17:02.290 --> 17:04.750
Neighborhood Assoc.       Karasuno

17:02.290 --> 17:04.750
Neighborhood Assoc.       Karasuno

17:04.750 --> 17:07.420
These high schoolers are pretty good.

17:07.420 --> 17:09.720
Us middle aged guys are gonna have to show our stuff.

17:12.930 --> 17:14.100
<i>A jump float!</i>

17:15.060 --> 17:15.850
Hinata!

17:15.850 --> 17:17.810
All right! I got it!

17:21.900 --> 17:23.020
See that?

17:23.020 --> 17:24.360
That's immature.

17:25.820 --> 17:26.860
What is that?

17:26.860 --> 17:30.490
That serve didn't look like it had much momentum.

17:30.490 --> 17:32.030
That is a jump float serve.

17:32.860 --> 17:36.120
Serving it without any spin gives the ball a shaky trajectory.

17:36.120 --> 17:38.000
It can swerve and drop without warning.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.210
It's like a knuckleball. That's so cool!

17:42.960 --> 17:45.250
Yamaguchi, that's your point.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.380
Oh, sorry.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.050
One more!

17:51.010 --> 17:52.760
Hey, watch it!

17:55.890 --> 18:00.600
Neighborhood Assoc.       Karasuno

17:55.890 --> 18:00.600
Neighborhood Assoc.       Karasuno

17:58.060 --> 17:58.970
Yes!

17:58.970 --> 18:00.600
This is the 4th point in a row.

18:00.600 --> 18:03.520
The first-year combo attack is impressive,

18:01.310 --> 18:03.980
What happened to all that enthusiasm, high schoolers?

18:03.520 --> 18:07.070
but the first-years and second-years' receives need work.

18:03.980 --> 18:05.480
That's match point!

18:08.070 --> 18:09.860
You're all mine!

18:12.950 --> 18:13.740
Nice receive!

18:14.280 --> 18:16.160
You won't get away with it this time, Shorty!

18:17.780 --> 18:18.580
Caught him!

18:20.290 --> 18:21.500
Oh no!

18:22.080 --> 18:24.500
Hello! Remember me?!

18:25.580 --> 18:26.340
What?!

18:26.340 --> 18:27.380
Nice, Nishinoya!

18:28.420 --> 18:29.420
Suga!

18:30.090 --> 18:31.130
Asahi!

18:42.060 --> 18:44.270
Neighborhood Assoc.       Karasuno

18:42.060 --> 18:44.270
Neighborhood Assoc.       Karasuno

18:44.270 --> 18:46.900
Damn. I'm sorry, Hinata!

18:46.900 --> 18:48.940
I was totally wide open too!

18:48.940 --> 18:50.110
Th-That's okay.

18:50.110 --> 18:51.230
But that was amazing.

18:51.740 --> 18:54.450
You had them all dogging after you.

18:54.450 --> 18:55.950
It almost made me jealous.

18:57.030 --> 18:58.200
I'll be counting on you next time!

18:58.870 --> 19:00.490
Y-Yessir!

19:02.200 --> 19:05.790
I don't know what just happened, 
but that made me feel young again.

19:06.210 --> 19:09.250
"Please call for a set, ace!"

19:09.250 --> 19:10.750
It's great to be young!

19:10.750 --> 19:14.880
"With me around, you're the greatest!" I wish I could say that!

19:14.880 --> 19:16.510
High schoolers sure are cool!

19:18.720 --> 19:21.720
You made us old timers feel like yesterday's news!

19:21.720 --> 19:23.180
S-Sorry, sir.

19:24.230 --> 19:25.230
How can I say it?

19:25.230 --> 19:31.360
You guys haven't got it together yet, but once you do pull together, I think you guys are going places.

19:33.860 --> 19:35.320
Thank you so much!

19:35.320 --> 19:37.030
Thank you!

19:39.030 --> 19:42.910
Anyway, receiving! You can't get anywhere without that.

19:43.870 --> 19:46.040
We'll be training those fully tomorrow!

19:46.040 --> 19:47.290
Yessir!

19:47.870 --> 19:48.960
Thank you, sir!

19:48.960 --> 19:50.000
Sir!

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Hey, don't skip the stretches.

19:52.340 --> 19:53.380
Stretch!

19:53.380 --> 19:54.630
Yessir!

19:55.840 --> 19:57.050
Rotate slowly!

19:58.090 --> 20:02.260
Is their receiving really that bad? Bad enough to sigh about?

20:02.260 --> 20:04.980
No, setting that aside.

20:06.100 --> 20:11.150
I never gave it much thought when I was up for selection,

20:11.610 --> 20:15.240
but the one doing the selecting has a tough job.

20:16.150 --> 20:19.660
Equipment Room

20:16.150 --> 20:19.660
Equipment Room

20:16.150 --> 20:19.660
m 846 373.5 l 844.5 460.5 1159.5 490.5 1161 406.5

20:17.280 --> 20:18.490
Get it all put away!

20:18.490 --> 20:19.660
Yessir!

20:19.950 --> 20:21.870
Yamaguchi, bring the balls over there.

20:21.870 --> 20:22.450
Right!

20:22.450 --> 20:24.330
Okay. One, two...

20:22.700 --> 20:23.660
Asahi?

20:26.790 --> 20:29.080
I'm no ace...

20:29.960 --> 20:32.710
but I can clear a path for the ace!

20:33.630 --> 20:36.210
I'll become the greatest decoy!

20:40.220 --> 20:43.310
A-Although, I can't do that without Kageyama's sets.

20:44.220 --> 20:46.890
So, what I'm trying to say is...

20:46.890 --> 20:49.940
<i>"Give it your best!" doesn't sound right.</i>

20:49.940 --> 20:53.440
<i>"Let's give it our best!" sounds kind of snotty.</i>

20:52.650 --> 20:53.440
Hinata?

20:54.820 --> 20:55.690
Is that your name?

20:56.360 --> 21:04.080
The ace is basically the name given to the left wing spiker, which makes him me or Tanaka.

21:04.080 --> 21:05.040
Yes.

21:05.040 --> 21:12.540
It's definitely the ace's job to break through triple blocks and to receive delivery of sets when the timing is crucial.

21:13.630 --> 21:18.550
With your speed and jumping ability and my sets, you can take on any blockers!

21:19.420 --> 21:24.760
I think that having a setter say something like that to you is awesome.

21:26.600 --> 21:32.730
Anyway, what I'm saying is, 
no matter what name the position is given,

21:32.730 --> 21:37.610
I'd say that the player that terrifies the opposing team the most has to be the coolest.

21:37.610 --> 21:41.320
Like, "Look out for that middle blocker! He's crazy." Things like that.

21:41.320 --> 21:42.410
Yeah, yeah.

21:44.870 --> 21:45.990
I'm not gonna lose.

21:48.950 --> 21:50.120
Yessir!

21:52.670 --> 21:56.800
But that's only if I'm allowed back into the starting lineup.

21:58.760 --> 22:02.010
Asahi, you sure are timid for such a big guy.

22:02.680 --> 22:05.100
You're back in action, Suga.

22:05.720 --> 22:08.680
I apologize for worrying and obsessing.

22:08.680 --> 22:10.230
I didn't say that.

22:11.270 --> 22:13.060
And the reliable Nishinoya is back too.

22:13.060 --> 22:13.730
Yessir!

22:14.440 --> 22:17.520
But you can never shove the Vice Principal ever again.

22:18.610 --> 22:23.240
I suppose our timid wing blocker,
 the ace in name alone, is also back.

22:23.240 --> 22:24.660
Now that I think about it.

22:26.370 --> 22:29.080
Okay, get this thing locked down and go home!

22:35.880 --> 22:38.040
Karasuno... fight!

22:38.420 --> 22:40.460
Yeah!

22:42.010 --> 22:42.010
{ED}

22:52.640 --> 22:56.560
If I tell you this story,

22:56.560 --> 23:00.320
I wonder if I can explain to you

23:00.820 --> 23:04.780
my feelings

23:04.780 --> 23:07.780
and the distance between us

23:08.490 --> 23:16.460
Standing on an empty field

23:16.790 --> 23:25.380
I breathe out into the night air

23:25.380 --> 23:29.930
Countless times I swore that I would change

23:29.930 --> 23:33.930
I stumbled and fell a lot,

23:33.930 --> 23:37.900
but I swore I would laugh at the end

23:37.900 --> 23:41.820
and not let my tears go to waste

23:41.820 --> 23:45.860
There are so many dreams that can definitely come true

23:45.860 --> 23:49.820
I always sat somewhere, downcast, dejected, depressed,

23:49.820 --> 23:52.370
but still I decided I would fight,

23:52.370 --> 23:57.370
and not let all my frustration go to waste

23:57.370 --> 24:01.710
This is our revenge
