All...

00:50.320 --> 00:57.200
...right!

01:04.040 --> 01:06.750
They did it!

01:05.100 --> 01:06.750
Well done!

01:07.840 --> 01:10.420
That was no ordinary prefectural qualifier match.

01:10.420 --> 01:13.210
I got goosebumps.

01:13.210 --> 01:14.960
All right, time to line up!

01:14.960 --> 01:15.930
Right!

01:24.280 --> 01:26.390
Now we're tied at 1-1.

01:26.390 --> 01:28.060
Don't get too cocky.

01:29.560 --> 01:30.610
I won't.

01:39.950 --> 01:39.950

01:40.370 --> 01:43.370
Leap and fly! High!

01:43.370 --> 01:46.410
Flecked with blood, sweat, and tears

01:46.410 --> 01:50.630
Those glistening wings can let you leave it all behind

01:50.630 --> 01:53.790

Empty your mind

02:26.330 --> 02:31.920
Let the headwinds guide your approach

02:31.920 --> 02:34.040
And with a hop, step, and a jump

02:34.920 --> 02:38.050
Leap and fly! High!

02:38.050 --> 02:42.740
Let your wings, glistening with blood, sweat, and tears

02:42.740 --> 02:45.350
Take you to wherever you need to go

02:45.350 --> 02:48.140
Unleash your unrefined impulses

02:48.140 --> 02:51.150
Uncover your instincts and bare your uncut fangs

02:51.150 --> 02:53.020
It may take an arduous path

02:53.020 --> 02:55.230
But be torn down it endlessly to achieve your dream

02:55.230 --> 02:58.240
So just fly

03:00.450 --> 03:03.410
Fly high

03:10.580 --> 03:15.130
Episode Twenty-five: 
Declaration of War

03:11.040 --> 03:13.140
Thank you for the match!

03:15.710 --> 03:17.130
They did it, sir!

03:17.130 --> 03:17.840
Yes.

03:27.270 --> 03:28.600
<i>It looked like...</i>

03:29.530 --> 03:33.060
<i>he was actually able to predict
 where Hinata was going to hit it.</i>

03:34.540 --> 03:37.320
<i>If the ball didn't hit the blockers and change trajectory,</i>

03:37.320 --> 03:40.780
That was a very heartwarming match.

03:37.770 --> 03:39.490
<i>he might've gotten it.</i>

03:40.780 --> 03:43.740

03:45.020 --> 03:48.910
Nothing I say can change the results.

03:49.260 --> 03:51.210
I can't lessen the bitterness you feel, either.

03:52.380 --> 03:54.700
I'm sure there are moments you regret.

03:55.820 --> 03:59.050
With that in mind, let me just say something:

04:01.110 --> 04:03.010
You fought well.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.940
Let's go thank the people in the stands.

04:20.490 --> 04:24.590
<i>How can I be the ace when I couldn't even land that spike?!</i>

04:47.060 --> 04:48.970
Thank you very much!

04:49.500 --> 04:51.430
Thank you very much!

05:01.070 --> 05:03.280
Hey, hurry up!

05:03.280 --> 05:05.990
Yeah!

05:10.660 --> 05:11.840
We fell over!

05:11.840 --> 05:13.700
You guys are way too worked up!

05:13.700 --> 05:16.420
Hinata, you moron! Moron!

05:16.420 --> 05:18.790
Isn't it obvious that was going to happen?!

05:17.950 --> 05:19.960
Don't ever forget this sight.

05:19.460 --> 05:20.840
You goddamn moron!

05:20.840 --> 05:24.260
We're definitely going to get our payback!

05:24.260 --> 05:25.380
Yeah!

05:38.620 --> 05:40.270
Apparently we're about to head out.

05:45.780 --> 05:46.490
Okay.

06:06.720 --> 06:07.840
Kageyama!

06:12.390 --> 06:14.430
We're not gonna lose next time.

06:16.310 --> 06:17.100
Or so he says.

06:17.980 --> 06:18.690
Yeah.

06:28.450 --> 06:30.660
Hey!

06:30.660 --> 06:32.450
You guys were awesome!

06:32.450 --> 06:33.120
Yay!

06:33.120 --> 06:34.240
Big Sis!

06:34.240 --> 06:35.200
Ryuu!

06:35.200 --> 06:38.500
I'm amazed you dug up that one spike at the end! You looked awesome!

06:38.500 --> 06:39.920
Thanks...

06:39.920 --> 06:44.840
You know, I'm really happy for all the support, 
but could you please stop calling me by my first name?

06:45.570 --> 06:47.090
Don't be embarrassed!

06:47.090 --> 06:49.010
Ow, ow, ow!

06:50.180 --> 06:52.260
That was a great serve, Tadashi!

06:53.090 --> 06:54.560
Thank you very much.

06:54.560 --> 06:57.770
The last one! The last spike was amazing!

06:57.770 --> 06:58.680
Thanks!

06:58.680 --> 06:59.520
Thanks.

06:59.520 --> 07:07.230
At the end, I couldn't help but remember our last match, so when I saw three blockers, it was quite chilling.

07:08.370 --> 07:10.740
Just like when Azumane faced the Iron Wall,

07:11.650 --> 07:17.660
Kageyama probably thought about the future and felt it best for Hinata to break through himself.

07:18.620 --> 07:22.000
Actually, it might've been nothing more than instinct.

07:23.250 --> 07:26.880
It's so amazing that you got through such a tall block!

07:29.800 --> 07:33.260
At the end, the Great King reacted to my movements.

07:33.260 --> 07:34.930
I thought he was going to get it.

07:35.490 --> 07:38.310
He really is amazing.

07:42.660 --> 07:45.520
Can you load up the bus when it comes?

07:45.520 --> 07:48.070
I'm gonna go get everyone else.

07:48.070 --> 07:48.820
Okay.

07:59.760 --> 08:01.370
This is a warning, Oikawa.

08:02.580 --> 08:04.630
Never take the wrong path again.

08:05.060 --> 08:07.040
You took the wrong path.

08:07.700 --> 08:10.590
There was a place where you 
could've realized your true potential.

08:11.010 --> 08:15.510
But because of your worthless pride, you didn't choose it.

08:17.540 --> 08:22.730
So you're trying to tell me that I should've
 gone to Shiratorizawa instead of Seijou, right?

08:23.490 --> 08:26.770
No team is guaranteed to win.

08:27.670 --> 08:29.780
If nothing else, I can say...

08:30.880 --> 08:35.200
that my team is the best one here.

08:37.580 --> 08:40.660
Wow, I see you're still laughably confident!

08:43.200 --> 08:45.350
Worthless pride, huh?

08:46.180 --> 08:47.390
That's true.

08:49.010 --> 08:50.360
Listen up, Ushijima.

08:51.360 --> 08:57.200
I've never once regretted my decision, 
and my volleyball career isn't even close to over.

08:58.460 --> 09:00.810
Don't you ever forget

09:01.980 --> 09:03.880
my worthless pride.

09:06.870 --> 09:07.980
Oh, yeah.

09:08.990 --> 09:14.200
If you keep focusing on me, 
you'll get stabbed from where you least expect it.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.700
What's that supposed to mean?

09:17.000 --> 09:18.160
My junior...

09:19.010 --> 09:23.600
isn't smart, nor is he even close to my level yet...

09:26.880 --> 09:31.330
but now that he's no longer alone, he's dangerous.

09:36.130 --> 09:40.040
A murder of crows might even be able to kill the great white eagle.

09:42.560 --> 09:43.100
Hey.

09:43.860 --> 09:45.140
What the hell are you doing?

09:45.140 --> 09:47.310
Hurry up and get your stuff onto the bus!

09:47.900 --> 09:49.650
What's the matter?

09:51.840 --> 09:54.920
<i>Good fruit cannot be harvested from barren soil.</i>

09:56.560 --> 09:59.890
I'll show you just how much 
we can grow from the concrete.

10:02.280 --> 10:03.830
W-Wait!

10:35.730 --> 10:37.860
They played two hard matches today.

10:40.950 --> 10:43.280
I really appreciate all you've done, sir.

10:43.280 --> 10:45.620
Where did that come from?

10:45.620 --> 10:49.040
A team like ours who'd been struggling lately

10:49.540 --> 10:53.380
got to play so many practice matches 
with the powerhouse schools from Tokyo.

10:53.380 --> 10:55.250
All I can say is that we were blessed.

No matter how hard you try on your own, there are limits.

11:04.530 --> 11:12.060
That we were able to regain our connection with Nekoma is a much bigger deal than you or these guys think.

11:14.020 --> 11:16.230
You did something truly amazing.

11:16.230 --> 11:18.940
What? No, I didn't...

11:22.650 --> 11:26.950
If we win tomorrow, then you can praise me all you want.

11:26.950 --> 11:28.450
I'll make sure to.

11:37.660 --> 11:41.520
Okay! Grab your things and head 
straight to the gym for a meeting!

11:41.520 --> 11:43.390
Yessir...

11:43.390 --> 11:45.930
You totally drooled again.

11:45.930 --> 11:47.100
Gross.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.130
My drool isn't gross!

11:49.130 --> 11:50.850
Oh, they're back!

11:51.970 --> 11:54.270
Congrats on making it to the finals!

11:54.620 --> 11:56.110
Oh, Michimiya.

11:56.110 --> 11:57.320
How did you know?

11:57.320 --> 11:59.740
They just announced it over the loudspeakers.

11:59.740 --> 12:00.950
It's amazing!

12:00.950 --> 12:04.670
You beat Seijou and made it to the finals! It's just...

12:04.670 --> 12:06.090
Amazing! It's crazy!

12:06.090 --> 12:08.040
Your lack of vocabulary is crazy.

12:08.790 --> 12:10.750
Wait, what happened to your face?!

12:10.750 --> 12:13.250
Oh, it happened during one of our matches.

12:13.250 --> 12:15.580
It looks worse than it is.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.750
I see.

12:18.890 --> 12:21.050
Hey, boys' volleyball team!

12:22.170 --> 12:23.600
You guys are amazing!

12:23.600 --> 12:24.760
Congrats!

12:24.760 --> 12:27.970
Hinata! Kageyama! Well done!

12:28.310 --> 12:29.040
Ma'am!

12:29.040 --> 12:29.680
Thanks!

12:29.970 --> 12:31.890
I'm gonna cheer you on tomorrow!

12:32.270 --> 12:33.890
You better win!

12:34.810 --> 12:36.360
Do your best!

12:38.820 --> 12:41.030
They all stayed after school for us.

12:45.210 --> 12:47.200
<i>M-Sta Miyagi</i> is about to start!

12:58.630 --> 12:59.630
Good after-evening.

12:59.630 --> 13:01.420
Good after-evening!

13:02.370 --> 13:09.560
Today, at Sendai City Gymnasium in Tomizawa, 
the quarterfinal and semifinal matches were held

13:09.560 --> 13:14.550

13:22.280 --> 13:24.320
to advance to the finals for the first time in years.

13:24.950 --> 13:29.790

13:29.790 --> 13:31.060
Indeed.

13:31.060 --> 13:37.830
It was a well-balanced team headed by Oikawa, 
so it's a shame that we won't see them in the finals.

13:38.210 --> 13:40.680
C'mon! Show <i>us</i> a little more! We actually won!

13:40.680 --> 13:41.670

Stop showing just Seijou!

13:43.840 --> 13:46.140
This happens every time.

13:46.140 --> 13:48.800

13:56.940 --> 13:59.480
Here comes the headliner.

14:00.400 --> 14:06.700
That would be Shiratorizawa Academy,

Shiratorizawa Academy                                 Kesenuma West High School

14:11.660 --> 14:24.760
Shiratorizawa Academy                                 Kesenuma West High School

14:11.660 --> 14:24.760
Shiratorizawa Academy                                 Kesenuma West High School

14:12.740 --> 14:16.310
Looks like they had no problems winning in straight sets.

14:16.310 --> 14:17.040
Yes.

14:17.040 --> 14:21.910
They finally have the roster to win nationals, which they have been seeking for years.

14:21.910 --> 14:24.340
I think we can expect great things from them.

14:25.200 --> 14:31.180
It'll be interesting to see how high Karasuno can climb against the powerful Shiratorizawa Academy.

14:32.050 --> 14:37.640
The final will be broadcast live here at 11:00 AM.

Make sure to catch the match that will determine the Miyagi Prefecture representative!

14:46.580 --> 14:50.320
Now, tomorrow we'll be going up against Shiratorizawa,

14:51.240 --> 14:58.120
but in the three years since Oikawa joined Aoba Jousai, 
they've never beaten Shiratorizawa.

14:58.830 --> 15:00.370
Not even once.

15:01.140 --> 15:02.250
That's why people call them...

15:02.760 --> 15:04.340
undisputed champions.

15:05.130 --> 15:09.800
Ushijima is a given, but the rest of the team are some of the best in the prefecture too.

15:10.580 --> 15:13.260
It's no fluke that they're the best team in the prefecture.

15:13.970 --> 15:17.180
Shiratorizawa is even better than what you guys are thinking.

15:17.930 --> 15:21.270
No one actually thinks we're going to win.

15:21.270 --> 15:21.850
Huh?

15:23.400 --> 15:24.900
What is it, Hinata?

15:24.900 --> 15:26.320
None of that matters!

15:27.150 --> 15:28.640
Sir!

15:28.640 --> 15:30.610
Hey, don't talk to the coach like that!

15:30.610 --> 15:33.370
Oh, uh, I didn't mean it like that.

15:34.140 --> 15:35.770
It's fine. Just say it.

15:35.770 --> 15:37.580
R-Right.

15:38.140 --> 15:42.540
No one thought that we were going to beat Seijou either.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.730
That's why it doesn't matter...

15:45.360 --> 15:46.460
Sir.

15:49.010 --> 15:51.480
We're going to be the challengers again tomorrow.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.840
Let's turn the tables on them.

15:53.840 --> 15:54.800
Yes, sir!

15:55.720 --> 15:56.980
"The fallen champs."

15:56.980 --> 15:58.180
"The clipped crows."

15:58.820 --> 16:02.560
No one will call you that anymore.

16:03.230 --> 16:07.320
Those crows are now flying across the great blue sky with the wind under their wings.

16:08.140 --> 16:09.650
And I'm sure that you guys can go anywhere.

16:10.650 --> 16:11.860
Higher than anyone,

16:11.860 --> 16:13.450
and farther than anyone!

16:14.360 --> 16:17.030
All right, everyone. The time has come!

16:17.850 --> 16:20.350
Let's win tomorrow and go to nationals!

16:21.040 --> 16:24.210
Yeah!

16:24.510 --> 16:28.630
Okay. Now get home and go to bed so that you aren't tired tomorrow.

16:28.630 --> 16:30.210
Yessir!

16:30.210 --> 16:31.260
All right, dismissed!

16:31.260 --> 16:32.650
Yessir!

16:36.140 --> 16:36.930
Kageyama.

16:39.730 --> 16:41.850
Set for me.

16:47.690 --> 16:49.440
Huh? Are they...

16:49.820 --> 16:51.030
I knew it.

16:51.030 --> 16:52.440
Yachi!

16:52.440 --> 16:53.900
Could you throw us some balls?

16:53.900 --> 16:57.630
You guys played two matches today, so you should go home and rest up.

16:57.630 --> 17:00.490
If I went home right now, I'd be too worked up to sleep.

17:01.100 --> 17:01.880
So please!

17:01.880 --> 17:03.210
Please!

17:08.380 --> 17:09.670
I'm ready!

17:10.300 --> 17:10.920
Okay.

17:21.430 --> 17:22.020
Yeah!

17:22.570 --> 17:23.730
Give me one more!

17:23.730 --> 17:24.730
Okay.

17:38.990 --> 17:39.860
One more!

17:39.860 --> 17:40.620
Yeah.

17:42.560 --> 17:43.830
What's the matter, Yachi?

17:44.450 --> 17:46.210
Oh! I'm sorry!

17:47.540 --> 17:50.490
I just remembered something.

17:50.490 --> 17:51.170
What?

17:52.040 --> 17:57.510
The time you two got into that fight, I kept throwing balls to you like this.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.310
Really?

17:59.310 --> 18:01.140
What?! You don't remember?!

18:01.470 --> 18:04.100
Hinata, you charged in and grabbed on,

18:04.100 --> 18:06.660
and then Kageyama, you threw him on the ground.

18:06.660 --> 18:09.480
I was really scared, you know!

18:11.830 --> 18:13.540
O-Oh...

18:13.540 --> 18:14.690
Sorry.

18:15.020 --> 18:18.370
Oh, uh, I didn't mean it that way.

18:18.370 --> 18:20.660
Watching the matches today got me thinking.

18:21.420 --> 18:23.160
If I hadn't become a manager,

18:23.550 --> 18:28.080
I wouldn't have gotten so worried 
or excited watching today's matches.

18:28.080 --> 18:34.550
Nor would I have felt the same passion and joy you guys did from winning.

18:37.020 --> 18:43.970
It's probably all because I watched each of you work so hard to do something that you couldn't do before.

18:44.890 --> 18:48.590
I never would've had that experience anywhere else.

18:48.980 --> 18:51.940
So thank you!

18:52.730 --> 18:55.690
No, we have you to thank!

18:55.690 --> 18:57.820
You stayed with us through all our practices.

18:57.820 --> 19:02.320
Without you, we might've never been able to master our new fast attack.

19:02.320 --> 19:05.980
Really? A "Townsperson B" like me was able to help?

19:05.980 --> 19:07.270
Of course!

19:07.270 --> 19:09.440
You're the best Townsperson B in all of Tohoku!

19:09.440 --> 19:11.490
Is that even a compliment?

19:11.490 --> 19:12.920
Of course it is!

19:12.920 --> 19:16.060
If you're actually thankful too, then say something!

19:16.880 --> 19:17.920
Okay.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.000
Thanks.

19:19.980 --> 19:21.680
Is that all?

19:21.680 --> 19:23.730
There's all sorts of other things to say!

19:23.730 --> 19:27.240
Shut up! I thanked her, didn't I?!

19:27.240 --> 19:29.110
I-It's okay...

19:30.260 --> 19:31.460
What are you doing?

19:32.380 --> 19:34.170
Sh-Shimizu?!

19:37.510 --> 19:42.450
Making sure to rest is another important way to prepare for your next match.

19:42.450 --> 19:44.280
S-Sorry!

19:44.280 --> 19:45.830
Come on! That's enough!

19:45.830 --> 19:46.720
Let's clean up!

19:46.720 --> 19:47.760
What?

19:47.760 --> 19:49.330
Come on, hurry up!

19:49.330 --> 19:50.510
Okay...

19:51.370 --> 19:53.500
We got in trouble because of you.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.620
You wanted to practice too, didn't you?

19:55.620 --> 19:59.460
I'm sorry for helping them practice.

19:59.460 --> 20:00.550
No, it's fine.

20:01.400 --> 20:04.180
Actually, thanks for practicing with them.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.180
Right!

20:07.560 --> 20:11.060
Hitoka, it's already dark out, 
so let's go to the bus stop together.

20:11.060 --> 20:12.100
O-Okay!

20:12.100 --> 20:15.280
Hinata and Kageyama, make sure to head 
straight home after you're done cleaning up.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.690
Right!

20:31.090 --> 20:36.380
I wonder how the Little Giant felt the day before the finals.

20:37.040 --> 20:40.310
I'm super nervous, but...

20:43.060 --> 20:44.800
isn't it even more exciting now?!

20:49.330 --> 20:51.770
We're going to win tomorrow.

20:52.880 --> 20:53.690
Yeah!

20:56.020 --> 20:56.020
{ED}

20:56.020 --> 22:10.100
m -3 982.5 l 1923 982.5 1923 1083 -3 1083

20:56.400 --> 21:00.570
When I was just a nobody, something lit up my eyes

21:00.570 --> 21:06.470
I was merely a guy languishing complacently in the dark, happy with what I had

21:06.470 --> 21:10.790
Now I'm torn toward the heavens even on a starless night

21:10.790 --> 21:15.780
Whether our time comes to us or not is a matter for those in another world

21:15.780 --> 21:26.070
That's right, our lungs pumping and our hearts beating is all we have in this new realm

21:26.070 --> 21:31.200
We've always been dancing on an unlit stage, but now beyond that

21:31.200 --> 21:38.080
We're awaiting the rising of a sun that none have yet witnessed

21:38.080 --> 21:44.360
Now that we're deliberating at a crossroads, paths blurring together

21:44.360 --> 21:46.450
We can feel it

21:46.450 --> 21:51.610
Inside this uncharted world which has yet to take on a name

21:51.610 --> 21:57.900
As I'm waiting for the dawn to reach my eyes with a familiar light

21:57.900 --> 22:04.840
I'm reminded of days I won't return to, and seeking proof of newfound existence

22:04.840 --> 22:08.010
We brace ourselves

22:12.470 --> 22:12.470
{Outro}

22:17.740 --> 22:21.770
Seriously though, I didn't expect Karasuno to make it all the way to the finals.

22:21.770 --> 22:25.680
They beat Seijou, so maybe they're becoming a powerhouse again.

22:25.680 --> 22:27.570
Oh, speak of the devil.

22:42.290 --> 22:43.550
It's Ushiwaka.

22:45.660 --> 22:46.720
H-Hey!

22:50.590 --> 22:52.430
Hinata Shouyou.

22:52.430 --> 22:54.310
Kageyama Tobio.

22:55.310 --> 22:56.810
We made it to the finals.

22:57.620 --> 22:59.640
We, who grew from the concrete,

23:00.100 --> 23:03.130
will beat you and go to nationals!

23:11.810 --> 23:13.360
I look forward to it.

23:14.300 --> 23:15.450
Let's meet on the court.

23:21.710 --> 23:22.960
Damn it...

23:23.520 --> 23:25.460
I wanna play him right now!

23:29.120 --> 23:32.090
All right! We're definitely going to the spring tournament!

23:32.380 --> 23:35.060
Yeah!
