00:03.100 --> 00:04.440
Damn it.

00:05.140 --> 00:08.400
If we'd won yesterday, we'd be playing right now.

00:08.740 --> 00:12.080
If Karasuno can beat Shiratorizawa,

00:12.080 --> 00:14.480
we'll at least look a little cool.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.070
No, we won't.

00:16.070 --> 00:19.200
We would've won if their number ten wasn't around.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.950
Nah, it was the setter.

00:20.950 --> 00:22.250
That guy is ridiculous.

00:23.620 --> 00:25.460
I think it was the captain.

00:27.040 --> 00:29.910
Although number ten was the most amusing.

00:31.070 --> 00:32.170
The captain, huh?

00:33.110 --> 00:34.630
Well, you've got a point.

00:35.450 --> 00:39.040
Sort of like the foundation that no one really notices?

00:40.010 --> 00:40.010
{OP}

00:40.390 --> 00:43.390
Leap and fly! High!

00:43.390 --> 00:46.440
Flecked with blood, sweat, and tears

00:46.440 --> 00:50.650
Those glistening wings can let you leave it all behind

00:50.650 --> 00:53.810
So just fly

01:12.080 --> 01:17.220
As the ones who've just found their wings laugh derisively

01:17.220 --> 01:21.340
They just want to see the ends of the ocean

01:21.770 --> 01:26.350
Empty your mind

01:26.350 --> 01:31.940
Let the headwinds guide your approach

01:31.940 --> 01:34.060
And with a hop, step, and a jump

01:34.950 --> 01:38.070
Leap and fly! High!

01:38.070 --> 01:42.760
Let your wings, glistening with blood, sweat, and tears

01:42.760 --> 01:45.370
Take you to wherever you need to go

01:45.370 --> 01:48.170
Unleash your unrefined impulses

01:48.170 --> 01:51.170
Uncover your instincts and bare your uncut fangs

01:51.170 --> 01:53.050
It may take an arduous path

01:53.050 --> 01:55.260
But be torn down it endlessly to achieve your dream

01:55.260 --> 01:58.260
So just fly

02:00.470 --> 02:03.430
Fly high

02:03.430 --> 02:06.550
Into the distant future

02:10.060 --> 02:10.060
{Part A}

02:11.940 --> 02:13.270

02:18.950 --> 02:22.410
Episode Seventeen: 
The Fight of the Spineless

02:19.240 --> 02:20.160
What's going on?

02:20.160 --> 02:21.160
What's wrong?

02:21.160 --> 02:22.410
He collapsed!

02:23.410 --> 02:24.330
What's going on?

02:24.330 --> 02:25.870
They collided.

02:26.540 --> 02:29.490
Right after they hit the ball back over the net,

02:29.490 --> 02:32.460
number five, the guy with the shaved head, and the captain crashed into each other.

02:32.460 --> 02:35.510
It looked like he hit his head pretty hard.

02:35.510 --> 02:36.510
Seriously?

02:39.160 --> 02:40.470
Ow...

02:40.470 --> 02:41.510
Where were you hit?!

02:42.220 --> 02:44.180
M-My face?

02:44.680 --> 02:47.060
Sawamura, where are you right now?

02:47.810 --> 02:49.850
The Sendai City Gymnasium.

02:50.810 --> 02:52.650
Who are we playing right now?

02:52.650 --> 02:54.860
W-Waku South.

02:54.860 --> 02:56.480
I'm fine!

02:56.860 --> 03:01.110
Still, since you hit your head, please go to the infirmary.

03:01.110 --> 03:01.950
Right.

03:05.540 --> 03:08.120
Go have them confirm that you really are fine.

03:08.120 --> 03:11.370
That's the quickest way for you to return to the match.

03:12.630 --> 03:13.540
Yes, sir.

03:15.880 --> 03:16.500
Blood...

03:18.460 --> 03:19.760
Did you cut your lip?

03:20.550 --> 03:22.180
<i>He doesn't seem to be dizzy.</i>

03:24.640 --> 03:25.560
A tooth?!

03:26.640 --> 03:31.350
That might be it for their captain in this match.

03:31.350 --> 03:33.230
Though that's up to the coach.

03:33.860 --> 03:37.020
It'd be scary if he had a concussion.

03:37.860 --> 03:40.610
Can I leave the rest to you, sir?

03:40.950 --> 03:42.700
D-Daichi...

03:45.830 --> 03:46.660
I'm sorâ€”

03:46.660 --> 03:47.700
Sorry, Tanaka.

03:49.330 --> 03:54.500
I saw you coming in to cover, 
but my body just dived in on instinct.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.630

04:01.300 --> 04:01.340
{=8}Karasuno            Waku South

04:01.340 --> 04:01.380
{=9}Karasuno            Waku South

04:01.340 --> 04:01.380

04:01.510 --> 04:01.550
{=8}Karasuno            Waku South

04:01.550 --> 04:01.590
{=9}Karasuno            Waku South

04:01.550 --> 04:01.590
{=8}Karasuno            Waku South

04:01.590 --> 04:01.630
{=9}Karasuno            Waku South

04:01.590 --> 04:01.630
{=8}Karasuno            Waku South

04:01.630 --> 04:01.670
{=9}Karasuno            Waku South

04:01.630 --> 04:01.670
{=8}Karasuno            Waku South

04:01.670 --> 04:01.720
{=9}Karasuno            Waku South

04:01.670 --> 04:01.720
{=8}Karasuno            Waku South

04:01.720 --> 04:01.760
{=9}Karasuno            Waku South

04:01.720 --> 04:01.760
{=8}Karasuno            Waku South

04:04.980 --> 04:10.730
Shaved Head from Karasuno is pretty 
damn strong mentally during a match,

04:11.260 --> 04:15.230
but that's only when he's backed into a corner.

04:15.730 --> 04:20.070
I wonder how he'll hold up after knocking out their central pillar.

04:20.940 --> 04:25.910
If they lose this match, it'll probably be the captain's last.

04:26.240 --> 04:29.330
Sorry, Asahi. I'll be right back.

04:29.330 --> 04:30.750
Hold down the fort until then.

04:32.560 --> 04:33.460
I'm counting on you.

04:34.460 --> 04:35.920
You didn't even need to ask.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.170
Leave it to us.

04:43.760 --> 04:48.260
He's walking on his own, so I think he'll be fine.

04:48.950 --> 04:51.220
The problem is this match.

04:51.790 --> 04:55.850
I wonder who'll step up and replace their central pillar.

04:56.850 --> 04:58.480
The backup setter, maybe?

04:58.480 --> 05:01.830
They'd need to have done a lot of practice with the spikers

05:01.830 --> 05:07.030
or be skilled enough in both offense 
and defense to take on a wing spiker.

05:07.030 --> 05:09.080
It's a large hole to fill.

05:09.830 --> 05:15.120
I don't know if Karasuno has a
 wing spiker that can replace him.

05:15.580 --> 05:16.790
There's no one else!

05:16.790 --> 05:17.880
We're counting on you!

05:19.360 --> 05:21.430
You've got this, Chikara!

05:26.510 --> 05:29.050
He played in the practice match.

05:29.050 --> 05:30.640
What was he like again?

05:30.640 --> 05:32.390
I don't really remember him.

05:32.860 --> 05:36.440
Well, he seemed like a guy who can handle things well.

05:36.440 --> 05:40.860
Karasuno doesn't have a lot of players, 
so they might just not have anyone else.

05:42.190 --> 05:44.780
<i>This is the same as a practice match...</i>

05:45.900 --> 05:47.070
<i>Same as a practice match...</i>

05:48.490 --> 05:49.390
<i>Same...</i>

05:52.200 --> 05:54.790
Anyway, go play your heart out.

05:55.830 --> 05:57.620
<i>This isn't the same!</i>

05:57.620 --> 06:02.590
<i>Playing behind him and replacing him are completely different!</i>

06:04.260 --> 06:07.260
Oh, so it <i>is</i> you, Ennoshita.

06:08.760 --> 06:12.670
Is it okay if we start with a fast attack?

06:12.670 --> 06:14.430
Oh... sure.

06:14.430 --> 06:15.980
Chikara!

06:15.980 --> 06:19.980
Their number one tends to hit toward the sides,
 so keep that in mind!

06:19.980 --> 06:21.400
R-Right.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.650
You've got this, Ennoshita!

06:22.320 --> 06:24.530
<i>It's understandable that Ennoshita feels uneasy.</i>

06:23.650 --> 06:25.150
Let's do this!

06:25.150 --> 06:31.700
<i>But if anyone has to replace Daichi, 
everyone on our team thinks it should be you.</i>

06:25.150 --> 06:26.570
You can do it!

06:34.040 --> 06:37.330
Sorry, Ennoshita, but we're counting on you.

06:40.290 --> 06:42.210
Why are you apologizing?

06:43.350 --> 06:45.000
For crashing into Daichi?

06:46.010 --> 06:49.340
It's not surprising one of you got hurt after that collision.

06:49.340 --> 06:53.470
In the end, Daichi may've been subbed out because he collided with you,

06:53.970 --> 06:57.430
but if there's anything we're thinking about right now...

06:58.400 --> 07:00.690
Asahi, if you would.

07:00.690 --> 07:03.560
It's how we're glad you weren't hurt!

07:06.030 --> 07:08.280
Right, right. Come on, now.

07:08.280 --> 07:11.780
Our offense is already weakened just by having Daichi out.

07:11.780 --> 07:14.450
You guys being depressed is only going to make things worse!

07:15.580 --> 07:18.040
Wow, this is unexpected.

07:18.040 --> 07:21.870
Ennoshita seems like the timid type at first glance.

07:21.870 --> 07:23.170
No way!

07:24.880 --> 07:30.380
Based on how they act when they're over at our place, Chikara's definitely the don of the second-years.

07:31.880 --> 07:40.060
He's the best wing spiker for managing the out-of-control second-years who are the core of our offense.

07:40.060 --> 07:45.190
And lately, he's been spreading his 
influence over to the rascal first-years.

07:45.190 --> 07:46.400
True...

07:48.440 --> 07:50.780
Give us a good one, Ennoshita!

07:53.110 --> 07:53.820
Nice receive!

07:53.820 --> 07:54.490
Center!

07:56.950 --> 07:58.910
All right!

08:01.540 --> 08:02.920
All right...

08:04.080 --> 08:05.580
Let's turn this match around!

08:12.320 --> 08:13.010
Damn!

08:13.010 --> 08:14.090
I'm sorry!

08:13.010 --> 08:14.090
All right!

08:14.090 --> 08:16.300
I'll guard a little wider.

08:16.300 --> 08:18.060
Sorry to trouble you.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.470
Don't sweat it!

08:19.180 --> 08:22.350
<i>I don't compare to Daichi as far as technique is concerned,</i>

08:19.470 --> 08:20.810
We'll get the next one!

08:23.020 --> 08:29.230
<i>but now that I'm standing here,
 there's no point in running away by making excuses.</i>

08:24.600 --> 08:26.690
Give us another good serve, Takeru!

08:29.230 --> 08:30.230
<i>Not to mention...</i>

08:33.320 --> 08:38.120
<i>I already know that I'll just make things worse later if I run away now.</i>

08:41.200 --> 08:47.630
Bring it on!

08:49.110 --> 08:51.920
Not bad for a substitute captain!

The third-years will continue to lead 
the team until the spring tournament,

09:20.670 --> 09:25.580
but you second-years need to at least start
 thinking about who's going to be the next captain.

09:26.080 --> 09:28.810
That's what Mr. Ukai said.

09:28.810 --> 09:30.290
The next one, huh?

09:30.790 --> 09:32.710
I think Chikara should do it.

09:33.510 --> 09:34.420
Why?!

09:34.420 --> 09:36.370
Just 'cause.

09:36.370 --> 09:40.020
<i>Wait, you just ate that popsicle in two bites.</i>

09:40.020 --> 09:43.420
According to the rules, a libero can't be the captain, right?

09:43.420 --> 09:44.480
Yep!

09:44.480 --> 09:49.980
I think Tanaka's qualified too,
 but looking at our first-year starters...

09:52.200 --> 09:53.190
The simpletons.

09:54.650 --> 09:55.690
The smartass.

09:56.350 --> 10:00.120
Yeah. I think we need someone really calm at the top.

10:00.120 --> 10:04.030
I agree that Ennoshita should be captain, 
but I'm somehow not satisfied with the reason why.

10:04.030 --> 10:06.640
Actually, you guys need to include yourselves in the running!

10:06.640 --> 10:07.890
No way in hell.

10:07.890 --> 10:09.500
Yeah, not happening.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.170
C'mon, guys.

10:11.810 --> 10:14.460
But I ran away.

10:15.760 --> 10:19.510
There's no way I could lead the team.

10:26.380 --> 10:28.310
<i>During summer vacation last year...</i>

10:29.350 --> 10:31.360
Not yet! Not until you can dig this out!

10:33.770 --> 10:37.030
Come on! Don't get exhausted after that!

10:35.110 --> 10:38.490
<i>We lost two first-years the next day.</i>

10:37.030 --> 10:39.490
At this rate, we're never gonna finish!

10:38.490 --> 10:45.580
<i>And a few days after that, I ditched practice for the first time since starting volleyball in junior high.</i>

10:46.870 --> 10:48.330
<i>I faked being sick.</i>

10:51.040 --> 10:57.260
<i>I felt guilty of course, but at least I wouldn't 
have to get yelled at during strenuous practice.</i>

11:02.060 --> 11:04.390
Air conditioning is wonderful!

11:06.140 --> 11:09.560
<i>I skipped the next day, and then the day after that.</i>

11:11.580 --> 11:14.730
<i>I don't have to run in the heat.</i>

11:15.270 --> 11:16.940
<i>I don't have to get yelled at.</i>

12:16.500 --> 12:20.550
<i>Maybe I'm actually some huge masochist.</i>

12:26.920 --> 12:29.440
S-Sorry for ditching practice!

12:29.440 --> 12:31.200
Please let me join you!

12:31.200 --> 12:33.600
Ennoshita, I'm glad that you came baâ€”

12:33.600 --> 12:35.310
Then don't show up in your school uniform!

12:36.370 --> 12:37.640
Captain...

12:37.640 --> 12:40.530
I-I'm sorry! I'll change right away!

12:42.900 --> 12:47.370
Dealing with people is hard,
 but you can't be nice all the time, either.

12:47.370 --> 12:48.740
Right.

12:53.630 --> 12:56.420
Hey! If you're going to practice, get changed first!

13:00.660 --> 13:02.880
All right, let's get started.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.260
Yessir!

13:06.140 --> 13:07.410
Get running!

13:07.410 --> 13:08.560
Yessir!

13:08.560 --> 13:10.260
Y-Yessir!

13:10.260 --> 13:11.680
Karasuno... Fight!

13:11.680 --> 13:12.140
Yeah!

13:12.140 --> 13:12.600
Fight!

13:12.600 --> 13:13.230
Yeah!

13:13.230 --> 13:16.810
<i>There were five first-years that boycotted practice at the time.</i>

13:17.860 --> 13:22.690
<i>Two of them quit the team and seem much more lively now.</i>

13:24.010 --> 13:26.910
<i>Which is better is probably different for everyone.</i>

13:27.830 --> 13:31.990
<i>It was harder for me when I wasn't playing volleyball, so I went back.</i>

13:32.490 --> 13:37.750
<i>But the inferiority complex from running away will probably never disappear.</i>

13:40.500 --> 13:41.920
That might be why it should be you.

13:43.130 --> 13:45.520
All that matters is that you're back here with us now.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.350
Hey, I won!

13:47.350 --> 13:48.430
I'm gonna go redeem it!

13:49.260 --> 13:53.140
Not everybody who joins a sports team is going to be the reckless type.

13:53.140 --> 13:56.600
I don't know much about those
 who are a different type than me,

13:57.270 --> 14:00.310
but I think you do.

14:03.740 --> 14:06.650
Well, this is all in the future, so whatever.

14:06.650 --> 14:08.230
Yeah.

14:08.230 --> 14:09.530
All right!

14:10.870 --> 14:14.620
<i>In any case, there's no way someone spineless can do it.</i>

14:17.580 --> 14:21.540
Bring it on!

14:29.390 --> 14:30.350
It's up!

14:30.350 --> 14:31.520
Nice job, Ennoshita!

14:31.520 --> 14:32.350
Keep it going!

14:32.710 --> 14:33.720
Send it my way!

14:33.720 --> 14:35.020
Azumane!

14:37.560 --> 14:39.190
All right!

14:38.310 --> 14:39.190
Nice spike!

14:39.540 --> 14:41.080
Great job getting the ball up, Chikara!

14:41.080 --> 14:42.650
R-Right.

14:43.480 --> 14:48.400
<i>Even if I'm spineless, and even if I'm no match for Daichi, I'm still gonna fight!</i>

14:48.790 --> 14:51.910
<i>That's why I came back!</i>

14:52.570 --> 14:55.290
Karasuno                       Waku South

14:52.570 --> 14:55.290
Karasuno                       Waku South

14:53.800 --> 14:56.140
Give us a good serve, Asahi!

15:01.830 --> 15:02.920
Sorry!

15:02.210 --> 15:04.040
All right!

15:02.920 --> 15:04.920
It's okay. Let's get the next one!

15:04.040 --> 15:04.920
Nice serve!

15:04.920 --> 15:06.550
Nice job, Asahi!

15:06.920 --> 15:08.300
Do it again!

15:16.050 --> 15:18.850
Like hell we're letting you score again!

15:19.140 --> 15:21.270
I'm gonna get this!

15:24.580 --> 15:25.520
Nice, Hanayan!

15:25.520 --> 15:27.440
Waku South's pretty calm.

15:26.230 --> 15:27.440
Nice!

15:27.440 --> 15:28.860
Don't worry about it!

15:28.860 --> 15:30.180
You can do it!

15:30.180 --> 15:31.200
Yamaguchi.

15:31.200 --> 15:31.910
Yes?

15:31.910 --> 15:33.320
Nice receive!

15:32.360 --> 15:34.870
Shimizu's calling for you.

15:38.120 --> 15:40.040
All right!

15:40.040 --> 15:42.250
Nice spike, Tanaka!

15:40.040 --> 15:42.250
Karasuno                                Waku South

15:40.040 --> 15:42.250
Karasuno                                Waku South

15:44.750 --> 15:45.670
Huh?

15:49.880 --> 15:54.180
When Tsukishima's up to serve next, 
we'll have Yamaguchi come in as a pinch server.

15:54.180 --> 15:58.060
In this situation, the last thing I want is them coming back and taking this set.

15:58.060 --> 15:59.850
We're gonna make a run for it.

16:01.420 --> 16:02.730
All right.

16:03.700 --> 16:05.060
You're way too stiff.

16:05.900 --> 16:08.530
This isn't like the last time where the opponent was in the lead.

16:09.400 --> 16:12.450
The team's only thinking about how 
great it'd be if we managed to score.

16:14.360 --> 16:15.880
Thanks, Tsukki!

16:15.880 --> 16:18.330
Was that his attempt at encouragement?

16:18.330 --> 16:21.270
Tsukishima has such a smartass way of saying things.

16:21.270 --> 16:23.330
Do you feel like throwing up, Yamaguchi?

16:23.330 --> 16:24.150
Huh?

16:24.150 --> 16:25.630
I'm good so far.

16:25.630 --> 16:27.670
Then you'll be fine.

16:28.250 --> 16:30.400
Because I feel like I will.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.420
A-Are you all right?

16:33.130 --> 16:34.560
I can barely stand.

16:33.130 --> 16:35.220
<i>Well done, Ennoshita.</i>

16:34.560 --> 16:35.220
What?!

16:35.220 --> 16:41.140
<i>He knows how to get people to
 calm down when they're nervous.</i>

16:41.900 --> 16:42.770
I feel sick...

16:44.560 --> 16:46.400
<i>It'll be okay. It'll be okay.</i>

16:47.030 --> 16:51.070
<i>Just like Tsukki said, we're in the lead.</i>

16:52.250 --> 16:53.530
<i>And I practiced.</i>

17:02.350 --> 17:04.750
<i>Crap! The serve toss was a bit low!</i>

17:19.350 --> 17:21.220
Amazing serve!

17:19.970 --> 17:22.060
It's over the net!

17:22.850 --> 17:24.810
Karasuno                       Waku South

17:22.850 --> 17:24.810
Karasuno                       Waku South

17:23.390 --> 17:24.810
Just one more point!

17:27.600 --> 17:28.990
Give us a good serve, Yamaguchi!

17:28.990 --> 17:29.570
Do it again!

17:30.490 --> 17:32.070
R-Right...

17:32.070 --> 17:33.530
You've got this, Yamaguchi!

17:35.990 --> 17:39.200
<i>I was lucky that made it over.</i>

17:39.200 --> 17:42.450
<i>But if I miss the next one,
 the good and the bad will cancel each other out.</i>

17:44.470 --> 17:46.870
<i>So I have to...</i>

17:48.290 --> 17:51.280
<i>It's better to make sure to get it over the net.</i>

17:51.840 --> 17:54.920
Huh? I guess he's not doing a jump serve this time.

17:56.760 --> 17:57.930
Got it!

17:59.010 --> 17:59.600
Nice!

17:59.600 --> 18:02.490
Is it some kind of tactic to stop using the jump float serve?

18:02.490 --> 18:07.930
I think I remember that guy missing a serve when 
he was the pinch server during the Seijou match too.

18:07.930 --> 18:10.190
Not to mention, that last serve nearly didn't make it.

18:10.650 --> 18:12.690
I think he's just scared.

18:13.610 --> 18:15.360
<i>Crap! An attack is coming!</i>

18:16.150 --> 18:17.110
<i>Move, legs!</i>

18:18.740 --> 18:20.870
It's falling! Up front, up front!

18:21.950 --> 18:23.700
<i>Move, legs!</i>

18:26.250 --> 18:27.210
It's up!

18:27.000 --> 18:28.460
Someone get it!

18:27.210 --> 18:28.460
Nice, Chikara!

18:28.870 --> 18:30.130
Azumane!

18:30.130 --> 18:30.920
Right!

18:34.630 --> 18:37.550
All right!

18:35.800 --> 18:38.260
Karasuno                         Waku South

18:35.800 --> 18:38.260
Karasuno                         Waku South

18:46.890 --> 18:48.190
All right!

18:48.190 --> 18:51.270
Asahi, that last back row attack was awesome!

18:51.270 --> 18:52.130
Thanks.

18:52.130 --> 18:54.360
Hey, Mr. Ukai's back.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.070
Doesn't he seem really pissed off?

18:59.940 --> 19:03.530
Yamaguchi!

19:02.570 --> 19:03.530
U-Um...

19:04.820 --> 19:06.750
H-He knows.

19:07.450 --> 19:11.170
Probably better than anyone else.

19:15.630 --> 19:16.520
What?

19:16.520 --> 19:18.460
Was there a problem?

19:18.460 --> 19:20.090
Even if you don't jump,

19:20.090 --> 19:22.220
you can do serves that don't spin and are hard to receive.

19:22.980 --> 19:30.090
And if you jump and hit it from a higher point, the ball will travel faster and with more force.

19:30.090 --> 19:31.310
I see.

19:31.870 --> 19:36.020
I don't think it's bad to be defensive right now.

19:36.020 --> 19:41.490
{=1}Waku South                         Karasuno

19:36.020 --> 19:41.490
{=0}Waku South                         Karasuno

19:36.880 --> 19:39.820
In the end, Karasuno scored.

19:40.890 --> 19:41.490
But...

19:42.220 --> 19:46.870
the only thing Tadashi can use to fight alongside his team

19:48.230 --> 19:49.710
is his serve.

19:53.280 --> 19:57.380
If he runs away from that, he has nothing left.

20:05.890 --> 20:10.430
What the hell do you need besides your own pride?!

20:10.980 --> 20:15.080
Hey, Tsukishima. Don't you have something to say to Yamaguchi?

20:11.440 --> 20:14.270
<i>I acted all tough with Tsukki,</i>

20:15.080 --> 20:16.980
<i>but I'm just a spineless coward.</i>

20:15.900 --> 20:17.440
Why don't you go say something?

20:21.200 --> 20:22.780
<i>I'm so fucking lame.</i>

20:23.980 --> 20:25.870
Mr. Ukai, how's Daichi?

20:26.370 --> 20:27.450
He's fine.

20:27.450 --> 20:29.580
He doesn't appear to have a concussion.

20:29.580 --> 20:33.330
But his mouth is bleeding pretty badly, 
and he's in a lot of pain.

20:35.010 --> 20:37.380
I'm having him rest for a while, just in case.

20:40.430 --> 20:41.800
I know!

20:43.760 --> 20:47.060
We're gonna win and ready the next stage for Sawamura.

20:47.060 --> 20:50.060
There's nothing else to think about right now!

20:50.060 --> 20:51.640
Yes, sir!

20:54.000 --> 20:55.560
All right, let's go!

20:56.520 --> 20:58.980
Karasuno, fight!

20:59.420 --> 21:01.110
Yeah!

21:23.720 --> 21:27.510
Nice spike, Ushijima!

21:23.720 --> 21:28.930
Unstoppable Force

21:27.510 --> 21:33.390
Ushijima!

21:28.930 --> 21:33.390
Shiratorizawa                           Hakusuikan

21:28.930 --> 21:33.390
Shiratorizawa                           Hakusuikan

21:35.480 --> 21:38.560
Shiratorizawa's got just five more points to go.

21:39.270 --> 21:40.320
Time to head over.

21:40.320 --> 21:41.460
Yep.

21:41.460 --> 21:45.990
Also, it doesn't seem like the match between Karasuno and Waku South is going to end anytime soon.

21:45.990 --> 21:49.660
I wonder how Karasuno's doing without their captain.

21:50.500 --> 21:55.290
Just because a super receive is flashy, that doesn't mean it's good.

21:56.080 --> 22:02.000
If they're unable to dig out a spike they'd always been able to,

22:02.000 --> 22:02.050
{=7}Waku South

22:02.000 --> 22:02.050

22:02.960 --> 22:03.000

22:11.870 --> 22:13.890
that's how they're feeling right about now.

22:15.140 --> 22:15.140
{ED}

22:27.360 --> 22:31.490
When I was just a nobody, something lit up my eyes

22:31.490 --> 22:37.290
I was merely a guy languishing complacently in the dark, happy with what I had

22:31.490 --> 22:37.290
I was merely a guy languishing complacently in the dark, happy with what I had

22:37.290 --> 22:41.710
Now I'm torn toward the heavens even on a starless night

22:41.710 --> 22:46.760
Whether our time comes to us or not is a matter for those in another world

22:46.790 --> 22:56.970
That's right, our lungs pumping and our hearts beating is all we have in this new realm

22:46.790 --> 22:56.970
That's right, our lungs pumping and our hearts beating is all we have in this new realm

22:56.970 --> 23:02.110
We've always been dancing on an unlit stage, but now beyond that

23:02.110 --> 23:08.900
We're awaiting the rising of a sun that none have yet witnessed

23:08.900 --> 23:14.830
Now that we're deliberating at a crossroads, paths blurring together

23:08.900 --> 23:14.830
Now that we're deliberating at a crossroads, paths blurring together

23:15.370 --> 23:17.450
We can feel it

23:15.370 --> 23:17.450
We can feel it

23:17.450 --> 23:22.580
Inside this uncharted world which has yet to take on a name

23:22.580 --> 23:28.840
As I'm waiting for the dawn to reach my eyes with a familiar light

23:28.840 --> 23:35.760
I'm reminded of days I won't return to, and seeking proof of newfound existence

23:35.760 --> 23:38.600
We brace ourselves

23:45.190 --> 23:45.190

<i>Good job, Ennoshita. You'd probably make a good captain.</i>

23:48.860 --> 23:50.740
<i>I wonder who'd be a good vice captain.</i>

23:51.150 --> 23:53.010
<i>Definitely not Tanaka or Noya.</i>

23:53.010 --> 23:53.660
<i>Why?</i>

23:53.660 --> 23:55.070
<i>Because they both act like children.</i>

23:55.070 --> 23:56.490
<i>Did you really just say that?!</i>
