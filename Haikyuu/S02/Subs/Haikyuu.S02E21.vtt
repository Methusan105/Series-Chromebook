WEBVTT

00:20.330 --> 00:21.620
<i>It went out of bounds!</i>

00:22.830 --> 00:23.960
So lucky!

00:23.960 --> 00:27.420
Karasuno                    Aoba Jousai

00:23.960 --> 00:27.420
Karasuno                    Aoba Jousai

00:24.250 --> 00:27.420
We won the first set against Seijou!

00:27.420 --> 00:29.250
We took the first set!

00:29.250 --> 00:30.710
All right!

00:30.710 --> 00:32.880
Take the second set too!

00:33.460 --> 00:34.760
Sorry.

00:34.760 --> 00:36.050
<i>That idiot!</i>

00:36.050 --> 00:40.350
<i>Not only was that obviously Kindaichi's ball, 
but then he steals it only to hit it out of bounds?!</i>

00:40.680 --> 00:43.600
<i>On top of that, they were at set point!</i>

00:43.600 --> 00:45.350
<i>How can I even start to explain?!</i>

00:46.270 --> 00:48.310
What you did was dangerous!

00:49.150 --> 00:50.290
<i>Iwaizumi!</i>

00:50.290 --> 00:53.420
Yeah, that's it! That needs to be said first!

00:53.420 --> 00:55.570
Oh, I'm perfectly fine...

00:56.190 --> 00:59.950
I was stressed because I had to
 stand on the sidelines for so long.

00:59.950 --> 01:02.040
That's not a valid reason!

01:02.040 --> 01:03.610
What's with that guy?

01:03.610 --> 01:07.000
Why would Seijou swap in a guy like that?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.790
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

01:07.000 --> 01:09.790
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

01:11.920 --> 01:14.510
Oh, it's that guy from earlier.

01:14.510 --> 01:16.730
He must be starting this set.

01:16.730 --> 01:21.060
Since he's replacing Kunimi, 
he might be pretty quick on his feet.

01:21.060 --> 01:22.140
Be careful.

01:22.140 --> 01:27.270
You're more or less free to play how you want, 
but if you get in our way, you'll be back on the bench.

01:28.460 --> 01:31.480
Just don't do anything dangerous like before.

01:31.480 --> 01:32.160
Right.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.610
Why did you only reply to Iwa?!

01:34.610 --> 01:40.520
He challenged Iwaizumi every chance he got and lost every single time,

01:40.520 --> 01:43.390
so Iwaizumi is the only person he obeys.

01:42.410 --> 01:45.580
Arm Wresting Contest

01:42.410 --> 01:45.580
Arm Wresting Contest

01:43.390 --> 01:44.500
Not so fast!

01:43.390 --> 01:45.580
What are we, a wolf pack?

01:45.580 --> 01:49.630
Well, the one who'll be putting him to use is Oikawa.

01:49.630 --> 01:51.040
That's true.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.760
Let's ride this momentum and settle the score!

01:53.760 --> 01:55.630
We're gonna win the second set too!

01:55.630 --> 01:57.090
Yeah!

01:57.930 --> 01:57.930

Leap and fly! High!

02:01.390 --> 02:04.430

02:04.430 --> 02:08.650

02:08.650 --> 02:11.800

02:35.210 --> 02:39.330
They just want to see the ends of the ocean

02:39.760 --> 02:44.340
Empty your mind

02:44.340 --> 02:49.940
Let the headwinds guide your approach

02:49.940 --> 02:52.050
And with a hop, step, and a jump

02:52.940 --> 02:56.070
Leap and fly! High!

02:56.070 --> 03:00.750
Let your wings, glistening with blood, sweat, and tears

03:00.750 --> 03:03.370
Take you to wherever you need to go

03:03.370 --> 03:06.160
Unleash your unrefined impulses

03:06.160 --> 03:09.160
Uncover your instincts and bare your uncut fangs

03:09.160 --> 03:11.040
It may take an arduous path

03:11.040 --> 03:13.250
But be torn down it endlessly to achieve your dream

03:13.250 --> 03:16.250
So just fly

03:18.460 --> 03:21.430
Fly high

03:21.430 --> 03:24.540

03:31.140 --> 03:33.900
You can do this, Asahi!

03:38.180 --> 03:38.990
Let it go!

03:40.150 --> 03:42.240
Damn it! Sorry!

03:42.240 --> 03:43.700
So close! You'll get the next one!

03:43.700 --> 03:44.530
Shake it off!

03:44.530 --> 03:45.240
Your face is scary!

03:45.240 --> 03:46.620
What'd you say?!

03:46.620 --> 03:48.240
Give us a good one, Oikawa!

03:46.620 --> 03:49.330
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

03:46.620 --> 03:49.330
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

03:50.750 --> 03:51.960
It's going out!

03:54.080 --> 03:55.130
Sorry!

03:55.130 --> 03:56.960
It's fine! We'll get the next one!

03:56.960 --> 03:59.050
I wonder what's wrong with Oikawa.

03:59.050 --> 04:00.590
He messed up another serve.

04:00.590 --> 04:02.590
He hits the ball so hard, though.

04:02.590 --> 04:04.930
Touching it would tear off your arms.

04:06.050 --> 04:08.810
<i>I think his aim is slowly getting better.</i>

04:11.910 --> 04:13.440
Give us a good serve, Tsukishima!

04:16.440 --> 04:17.400
Bastard!

04:17.400 --> 04:18.980
Nice save, Iwa!

04:18.150 --> 04:19.900
<i>There are three attackers in the front row.</i>

04:19.900 --> 04:20.820
<i>Who's it gonna be?</i>

04:20.820 --> 04:22.110
Mad Dog!

04:22.390 --> 04:24.320
<i>An open set to the right?!</i>

04:24.320 --> 04:25.870
<i>What the heck is "Mad Dog"?!</i>

04:25.870 --> 04:27.090
<i>Is that his nickname?</i>

04:27.090 --> 04:28.200
<i>That's so awesome!</i>

04:29.450 --> 04:30.910
Block it!

04:29.790 --> 04:31.410
What?

04:32.270 --> 04:34.500
He's sprinting basically parallel to the net?!

04:35.380 --> 04:36.540
Three blockers!

04:45.230 --> 04:47.140
That cut shot was insane!

04:47.890 --> 04:49.760
So that's why he made that approach.

04:49.760 --> 04:50.850
Huh?

04:51.240 --> 04:55.360
When you face the blockers head-on, 
you have some options for where to hit it,

04:55.360 --> 04:57.940
but chances are you'll get blocked.

04:59.500 --> 05:04.150
Instead, he hit it to cut across the blockers.

05:04.150 --> 05:08.530
He comes in from the right and hits with his right hand,
 pulling off that incredible cut shot.

05:08.530 --> 05:09.870
Wow!

05:09.870 --> 05:11.910
Mad Dog is amazing!

05:13.580 --> 05:16.790
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

05:13.580 --> 05:16.790
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

05:14.660 --> 05:16.290
Give us a good one, Iwaizumi!

05:19.920 --> 05:21.880
It's coming back over! We can score here!

05:21.880 --> 05:23.010
Damn it! Sorry!

05:23.650 --> 05:28.050
<i>Oikawa and Iwaizumi serving back-to-back is putting a lot of pressure on them.</i>

05:24.920 --> 05:25.760
Got it!

05:28.050 --> 05:30.470
<i>And on top of that, there's also Mad Dog.</i>

05:32.390 --> 05:33.890
A double quick attack?!

05:39.650 --> 05:40.730
All right!

05:41.440 --> 05:47.110
I know he's a mad dog, but he's not going to keep biting forever, so you can come inside.

05:47.730 --> 05:51.290
Shorty caught on that you weren't going to hit it, Kindaichi.

05:51.290 --> 05:53.660
Sorry! I chickened out a bit there!

05:54.200 --> 05:56.160
Give us another good serve, Iwa!

06:01.340 --> 06:02.130
Yeah!

06:02.130 --> 06:03.800
Nice receive!

06:04.260 --> 06:05.260
<i>C Quick!</i>

06:10.720 --> 06:12.390
Y-You okay?!

06:12.390 --> 06:14.850
Y-Yeah, I'm fine. Totally fine.

06:15.390 --> 06:17.390
It's number sixteen again!

06:17.390 --> 06:18.980
That's three points in a row!

06:20.840 --> 06:25.300
<i>Even though his spikes are landing, they seem pretty violent.</i>

06:25.300 --> 06:29.280
<i>Ever since number sixteen subbed in, 
the rhythm of their attacks has changed.</i>

06:29.750 --> 06:31.200
Nice spike, Kyoutani!

06:31.990 --> 06:33.950
Give us another good serve, Iwaizumi!

06:31.990 --> 06:34.950
Aoba Jousai                  Karasuno

06:31.990 --> 06:34.950
Aoba Jousai                  Karasuno

06:37.810 --> 06:38.920
Sorry!

06:39.300 --> 06:40.670
All right!

06:39.300 --> 06:41.380
We finally got a point back.

06:46.250 --> 06:47.130
Nice, Makki!

06:49.500 --> 06:50.340
<i>Here he comes!</i>

06:50.340 --> 06:51.680
<i>You're on, Mad Dog!</i>

06:54.680 --> 06:57.180
<i>After number sixteen makes a few flashy attacks,</i>

06:58.120 --> 06:59.770
<i>it's a broad jump from Kindaichi!</i>

07:01.900 --> 07:03.360
All right!

07:06.490 --> 07:09.740
<i>He's angry that he was used as a decoy.</i>

07:09.740 --> 07:14.780
<i>That anger just makes him a better decoy, though.</i>

07:15.660 --> 07:19.330
<i>I'll make those fangs of yours even sharper.</i>

07:20.620 --> 07:22.040
Let's play carefully.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.210
That team isn't the Seijou we're familiar with.

07:25.210 --> 07:27.670
Aoba Jousai                             Karasuno

07:25.210 --> 07:27.670
Aoba Jousai                             Karasuno

07:25.800 --> 07:27.170
Give us a good serve, Kindaichi!

07:29.380 --> 07:30.300
Got it!

07:31.120 --> 07:32.440
Left!

07:31.120 --> 07:32.440
Center!

07:34.300 --> 07:37.760
<i>So their strategy is to always have a middle blocker on Hinata?</i>

07:37.760 --> 07:38.890
It's up! Get it!

07:38.890 --> 07:40.480
Got it! Finish it off, Kyoutani!

07:40.930 --> 07:42.190
Sorry! It's close to the net!

07:42.690 --> 07:43.900
Three blockers!

07:43.900 --> 07:45.520
<i>If he spikes, they'll block it.</i>

07:45.520 --> 07:46.570
Hit it back to us!

07:50.950 --> 07:53.280
Nice block!

07:50.950 --> 07:53.280
All right!

07:53.830 --> 07:56.910
That was an amazingly brave spike.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.080
That idiot...

07:58.080 --> 08:01.750
Dumbass! You could've done a soft hit or tipped it over!

08:02.080 --> 08:05.710
An attack doesn't feel right if I don't hit it as hard as I can!

08:09.130 --> 08:09.930
You little...

08:09.930 --> 08:12.200
Now, now, Mizoguchi.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.340
What needs to be corrected will be corrected in due time.

08:15.970 --> 08:16.850
Right.

08:17.350 --> 08:19.680
What were you saying about him being smart?

08:19.680 --> 08:21.890
I just thought that he <i>might</i> be!

08:21.890 --> 08:24.150
He doesn't know how good it feels to get a nice tip off!

08:24.150 --> 08:25.560
What a shame.

08:25.560 --> 08:28.020
Aoba Jousai                 Karasuno

08:25.560 --> 08:28.020
Aoba Jousai                 Karasuno

08:27.190 --> 08:28.020
Makki!

08:29.830 --> 08:30.570
Nice one, Nishinoya!

08:35.030 --> 08:36.320
Nice, Makki!

08:36.320 --> 08:37.200
Mad Dog!

08:38.030 --> 08:40.490
He's coming in from the side again!

08:40.490 --> 08:42.020
<i>I'm going to stop him this time!</i>

08:45.960 --> 08:47.630
All right!

08:47.630 --> 08:49.210
What a relief.

08:49.210 --> 08:56.470
I guess trying to bust through three blockers via a narrow gap with a powerful spike has its risks.

08:56.970 --> 09:00.350
That attack is powerful but unreliable.

09:00.350 --> 09:03.560
Since he didn't start in any matches so far,

09:03.980 --> 09:07.520
he might be something of a double-edged sword.

09:07.900 --> 09:09.710
Number sixteen's spike...

09:10.610 --> 09:12.850
It was all "whoosh" and "boom"!

09:12.850 --> 09:13.860
It's so cool!

09:14.570 --> 09:16.410
<i>Isn't it?</i>

09:17.410 --> 09:23.120
<i>Of course, Mad Dog can jump high, as well as 
having unbelievable dorsal and abdominal muscles.</i>

09:22.080 --> 09:23.120
Nice receive!

09:24.950 --> 09:28.330
<i>He arches back to build up power, and then he lets it all loose!</i>

09:30.170 --> 09:31.630
<i>He really packs a punch.</i>

09:31.630 --> 09:34.470
<i>If he gets through a block, the ball won't be easy to dig out.</i>

09:34.920 --> 09:36.590
All right!

09:34.920 --> 09:37.010
He finally got one in.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.350
Oikawa used him well.

09:39.350 --> 09:42.310
If it were me, I would've given the ball to someone else.

09:42.310 --> 09:45.280
Tenacity and boldness.

09:45.970 --> 09:50.310
You can't utilize Mad Dog if you're timid.

09:48.230 --> 09:49.860
Give us a good one, Kyoutani!

09:53.150 --> 09:54.110
Let it go!

09:55.950 --> 09:57.740
All right!

09:56.320 --> 09:58.660
His serve is quite dynamic too.

09:57.740 --> 09:59.160
Nice call!

09:59.160 --> 10:01.870
Aoba Jousai                 Karasuno

09:59.160 --> 10:01.870
Aoba Jousai                 Karasuno

09:59.910 --> 10:01.870
Such a back-and-forth match.

10:01.870 --> 10:03.550
It's basically a stalemate.

10:03.550 --> 10:04.500
Yeah.

10:04.500 --> 10:08.330
Number sixteen's spikes are impressive, but he messes them up often.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.330
All right!

10:10.880 --> 10:13.000
Give us a good one, Iwaizumi!

10:23.470 --> 10:23.970
Someone get it!

10:23.970 --> 10:24.770
Finish it, Makki!

10:26.640 --> 10:27.230
Got it!

10:27.230 --> 10:28.350
Let's go again!

10:30.480 --> 10:31.770
<i>He messed up the receive!</i>

10:32.520 --> 10:33.480
Watch the left side!

10:34.020 --> 10:35.320
<i>That was on purpose.</i>

10:37.360 --> 10:38.280
<i>Mad Dog!</i>

10:38.280 --> 10:39.660
<i>His timing's faster than before!</i>

10:40.050 --> 10:41.370
<i>It's second tempo!</i>

10:42.110 --> 10:44.700
<i>I'm well aware that he's a double-edged sword!</i>

10:44.700 --> 10:46.830
<i>All the more reason to make the best use of his strengths!</i>

10:51.000 --> 10:52.710
All right!

10:53.130 --> 10:55.090
What a crazy angle.

10:55.090 --> 10:59.930
Only a setter can know how good it feels to peel away the blockers using your own skill.

11:02.390 --> 11:04.510
Get on it!

11:04.510 --> 11:05.600
Nice receive!

11:05.600 --> 11:07.310
Center!

11:11.440 --> 11:13.900
Aoba Jousai               Karasuno

11:11.440 --> 11:13.900
Aoba Jousai               Karasuno

11:14.360 --> 11:15.980
Give us a good serve, Shouyou!

11:15.980 --> 11:17.860
Hinata, give it all you've got!

11:16.320 --> 11:19.470
<i>I rotated to the back row without spiking again.</i>

11:24.870 --> 11:25.830
Got it!

11:30.160 --> 11:31.420
Nice receive!

11:32.430 --> 11:34.250
<i>All right! Let's do this!</i>

11:40.770 --> 11:42.680
Hinata's doing a back row attack!

11:42.680 --> 11:44.890
<i>My first back row attack!</i>

11:47.350 --> 11:48.560
Yeah!

11:50.350 --> 11:52.980
Did you think now was your opportunity to use that?

11:54.190 --> 11:55.730
So did I.

11:56.230 --> 12:00.490
<i>Keep calm, keep calm, keep calm...</i>

11:58.530 --> 12:01.700
That was my back row attack's debut...

12:02.030 --> 12:04.450
I thought they could score two in a row.

12:04.450 --> 12:07.120
If they don't start catching up soon, they'll be in trouble.

12:08.910 --> 12:09.580
Huh?

12:09.580 --> 12:11.830
Sugawara got called over to the bench?

12:12.580 --> 12:14.880
Are they changing setters again?

12:14.880 --> 12:17.630
Kageyama seems to be doing fine.

12:17.630 --> 12:20.050
What happened now wasn't his fault.
 Oikawa is just really good.

12:20.910 --> 12:25.050
Actually, I don't think they're switching out Kageyama.

12:25.360 --> 12:27.510
I won't let them run away with this.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.680
We're going to do everything we can first.

12:47.160 --> 12:50.490
Is Sugawara switching with someone?

12:50.850 --> 12:53.080
It's a tactical player substitution.

12:53.080 --> 12:55.170
Please don't use such big words.

12:55.170 --> 12:57.260
Aren't you in college?

12:57.260 --> 13:00.800
You know how substitutions can happen 
when someone's not doing well or gets hurt,

13:00.800 --> 13:04.470
or how there are times where a pinch server or single-point blocker goes in, right?

13:05.270 --> 13:07.930
The latter two are tactical player substitutions.

13:10.850 --> 13:12.060
All right!

13:10.850 --> 13:13.310
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

13:10.850 --> 13:13.310
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

13:12.060 --> 13:13.310
Nice spike, Iwaizumi!

13:13.740 --> 13:20.270
In their previous match against Seijou, they were cornered and ended up being forced to switch him in.

13:20.650 --> 13:24.490
But this time, they're most likely doing it proactively.

13:25.820 --> 13:29.910
Number sixteen is a bit of an unknown, 
so dealing with Seijou has gotten even harder.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.410
But we're not going to just let them have it.

13:33.410 --> 13:35.960
Yes, but before that...

13:37.280 --> 13:38.960
Give us a good serve, Oikawa!

13:46.220 --> 13:47.630
<i>Oh, here it comes.</i>

13:49.200 --> 13:51.220
<i>That's a nice serve toss.</i>

14:00.940 --> 14:03.070
All right!

14:03.070 --> 14:06.360
<i>It's like getting slapped in the face really hard</i>

14:06.860 --> 14:09.390
<i>and snapping back to reality.</i>

14:10.740 --> 14:17.100
<i>Neither of us can let the other win, 
and we've both trained for that purpose.</i>

14:17.100 --> 14:19.080
<i>It all makes sense.</i>

14:19.840 --> 14:23.800
<i>It's an obvious fact, yet the reality is so terrifying.</i>

14:24.800 --> 14:26.510
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

14:24.800 --> 14:26.510
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

14:26.830 --> 14:28.350
Give us another good serve!

14:36.350 --> 14:37.560
Up front!

14:38.980 --> 14:40.940
<i>Damn it! I held back too much!</i>

14:39.330 --> 14:40.940
Nice receive, Nishinoya!

14:40.940 --> 14:41.810
Left!

14:41.810 --> 14:42.400
Tanaka!

14:42.820 --> 14:43.860
Three blockers!

14:48.990 --> 14:50.700
All right!

14:50.700 --> 14:52.700
Good one, Ryuu!

14:54.120 --> 14:55.160
Oh, here it is.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.410
The substitution.

14:58.120 --> 15:00.250
All right! We're gonna catch up now!

15:00.250 --> 15:01.580
Yeah!

15:02.460 --> 15:04.960
Suga, we need a good serve here!

15:04.960 --> 15:05.840
Yep.

15:06.550 --> 15:07.670
Bring it!

15:07.670 --> 15:09.010
Give us a good serve, Suga!

15:11.010 --> 15:13.970
<i>Serving right after you get subbed in sure is nerve-racking.</i>

15:14.850 --> 15:17.930
<i>But there's only one place to aim for.</i>

15:20.320 --> 15:20.890
Kyoutani!

15:22.100 --> 15:23.270
That was good!

15:23.270 --> 15:27.030
Now number sixteen can't make it in time for a spike!

15:34.780 --> 15:36.990
All right!

15:36.990 --> 15:38.120
They scored!

15:36.990 --> 15:38.950
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

15:36.990 --> 15:38.950
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

15:39.770 --> 15:41.960
Give us another good serve, Suga!

15:46.630 --> 15:47.300
<i>Again?!</i>

15:47.980 --> 15:52.800
<i>Kyoutani is a wing spiker, but he's the type who goes for one fast attack after another.</i>

15:52.800 --> 15:57.180
<i>They're getting him to move to receive serves so that he's out of position for spikes.</i>

15:57.470 --> 16:00.480
<i>What an annoying tactic from Karasuno's number two!</i>

16:03.190 --> 16:04.860
Nice receive, Daichi!

16:04.860 --> 16:06.150
All right!

16:06.150 --> 16:07.070
<i>Yes!</i>

16:09.990 --> 16:11.950
<i>Kageyama pulled back from an attack?</i>

16:11.950 --> 16:14.410
<i>Five Karasuno spikers?!</i>

16:20.200 --> 16:22.160
Yeah!

16:22.160 --> 16:24.060
N-Nice spike...

16:24.060 --> 16:27.380
Damn it. Kageyama's straight spike is awesome!

16:28.500 --> 16:31.220
Was that just now what you call a two-setter formation?

16:31.220 --> 16:34.180
Ugh, even more jargon...

16:34.180 --> 16:35.220
Then...

16:35.900 --> 16:39.180
It's a tactical single point by two setters!

16:39.180 --> 16:40.310
Right?

16:40.310 --> 16:41.390
That's too long.

16:41.390 --> 16:42.390
All right!

16:42.390 --> 16:44.310
Aoba Jousai                  Karasuno

16:42.390 --> 16:44.310
Aoba Jousai                  Karasuno

16:42.850 --> 16:43.810
Just one more point!

16:45.560 --> 16:47.020
All right!

16:47.020 --> 16:50.920
They're really in the groove after 
that well-timed player substitution.

16:51.690 --> 16:55.280
All of the third-years are good at receiving.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.530
I see!

Volleyball works on a rotational system where each player's position on the court constantly changes.

17:02.340 --> 17:07.740
The front row and back row have different jobs, so each rotation has certain strengths.

17:08.670 --> 17:10.140
And apparently,

17:10.800 --> 17:15.560
the rotation where Tsukishima is serving is weak for both offense and defense.

17:16.220 --> 17:19.100
There are only two spikers in front,

17:18.850 --> 17:18.890

So considering their rotation,
 it's quite a feat that they were able to keep scoring.

17:31.240 --> 17:32.990
Well, what's it going to be?

17:33.900 --> 17:35.280
How about we pull him back?

17:35.280 --> 17:36.200
Yeah.

17:40.190 --> 17:42.620
Give us another good serve, Suga!

17:44.160 --> 17:46.120
<i>They're going after Kyoutani again!</i>

17:47.080 --> 17:48.080
Got it!

17:48.790 --> 17:50.130
Nice, Makki!

17:50.130 --> 17:52.500
<i>They always figure out a solution so quickly!</i>

17:55.970 --> 17:57.130
All right!

18:02.350 --> 18:03.720
Nice work, Suga!

18:03.720 --> 18:04.930
Thanks.

18:04.930 --> 18:06.280
Damn it.

18:06.280 --> 18:08.440
I wanted to tie the match up.

18:08.440 --> 18:11.020
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

18:08.440 --> 18:11.020
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

18:11.940 --> 18:12.730
Tanaka!

18:15.590 --> 18:16.700
Yeah!

18:17.450 --> 18:19.030
Give us a good one, Kageyama!

18:21.370 --> 18:21.700
Iwa!

18:30.290 --> 18:31.500
He got it!

18:31.500 --> 18:32.710
Watacchi!

18:34.060 --> 18:34.880
Right!

18:38.550 --> 18:40.050
All right!

18:40.050 --> 18:41.260
How do I put this?

18:41.940 --> 18:46.890
Doesn't it feel like they're concentrating an unnatural amount of their offense on number sixteen?

18:46.890 --> 18:48.520
Yeah, it does.

18:49.190 --> 18:53.980
Maybe they're trying to get all the attention on number sixteen so they can hand it off to someone else later.

18:54.270 --> 18:58.950
<i>No matter how many times Mad Dog spikes, I'm not gonna get tricked anymore!</i>

19:00.390 --> 19:00.990
Tanaka!

19:00.990 --> 19:02.070
Got it!

19:05.240 --> 19:06.700
Nice, Makki!

19:06.700 --> 19:09.000
<i>I know why we subbed Kyoutani in.</i>

19:10.120 --> 19:14.920
<i>It's for the little extra punch we needed to improve our offense.</i>

19:15.890 --> 19:17.040
Mad Dog!

19:18.050 --> 19:20.880
<i>If we don't use him to his fullest, we're in trouble!</i>

19:22.860 --> 19:24.410
All right!

19:24.410 --> 19:25.350
Damn it...

19:28.680 --> 19:31.190
<i>Here come the points!</i>

19:32.520 --> 19:34.360
Hey, it was just getting good!

19:34.360 --> 19:37.600
They reached 20 points first.

19:37.600 --> 19:41.710
Even if they lose this set, 
Karasuno already won the first one.

19:41.710 --> 19:44.240
As long as they take the next set, they'll be fine.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.160
No.

19:45.830 --> 19:48.830
It's better to take this set by any means necessary.

19:46.490 --> 19:47.950
We're gonna finish this!

19:47.950 --> 19:49.290
Yeah!

19:49.290 --> 19:51.620
I have a bad feeling about the outcome if they don't.

19:53.920 --> 19:56.170
Give us another good serve, Kindaichi!

19:56.920 --> 19:57.750
Up front!

19:59.420 --> 20:00.920
S-Sorry!

20:00.920 --> 20:02.380
Don't overthink it.

20:04.090 --> 20:04.860
Here we go!

20:04.860 --> 20:06.560
Give us a good one, Tanaka!

20:08.010 --> 20:09.470
Nice receive!

20:20.650 --> 20:22.280
All right!

20:22.590 --> 20:27.240
<i>Trying not to think about something is no different than actually thinking about it.</i>

20:27.240 --> 20:29.450
Aoba Jousai                             Karasuno

20:27.240 --> 20:29.450
Aoba Jousai                             Karasuno

20:27.730 --> 20:29.450
Give us a good serve, Kyoutani!

20:33.750 --> 20:35.710
Bring it!

20:47.680 --> 20:49.350
All right!

20:49.350 --> 20:50.970
<i>The double-edged sword...</i>

20:52.050 --> 20:57.060
<i>Subbing in number sixteen was the sink-or-swim moment for Seijou,</i>

20:57.060 --> 21:01.400
<i>but I thought he had a proven track record.</i>

21:02.070 --> 21:03.030
Sir!

21:03.030 --> 21:03.780
Yes!

21:04.970 --> 21:05.660
All right!

21:05.660 --> 21:07.200
Again? That was fast!

21:07.200 --> 21:09.620
Now Karasuno's used up all of their timeouts.

21:11.790 --> 21:14.290
<i>With number sixteen as their new weapon,</i>

21:14.830 --> 21:17.080
<i>they racked up points in a disturbingly certain manner.</i>

21:17.080 --> 21:21.670
<i>Yet it turns out they were using most of this set to bring him up to speed?</i>

21:23.020 --> 21:27.010
<i>Kyoutani is slow to get going and needs lots of support.</i>

21:27.400 --> 21:28.970
<i>But once he does, he's quite impressive.</i>

21:29.890 --> 21:31.520
This isn't good.

21:31.520 --> 21:35.270
The mood of a match can have a huge impact on the next set.

21:35.270 --> 21:38.230
How the previous set ended is especially vital.

21:38.860 --> 21:42.070
Seijou definitely has the upper hand right now.

21:38.860 --> 21:40.480
Let's bring it in!

21:40.480 --> 21:42.730
Karasuno, fight!

21:42.070 --> 21:44.810
Karasuno needs to do whatever it takes to win this set and end it!

21:42.730 --> 21:44.110
Yeah!

21:48.710 --> 21:51.120
Give us another good one, Kyoutani!

21:54.080 --> 21:55.660
Let's get this one!

21:55.660 --> 21:57.370
Yeah!

21:59.700 --> 22:01.130
Stop bugging me.

22:01.130 --> 22:02.300
I already know.

22:12.050 --> 22:13.720
<i>Please put me in there!</i>

22:14.980 --> 22:14.980

22:27.240 --> 22:31.370

22:31.370 --> 22:37.170

22:37.170 --> 22:41.590
Now I'm torn toward the heavens even on a starless night

22:41.590 --> 22:46.640
Whether our time comes to us or not is a matter for those in another world

22:46.670 --> 22:56.850
That's right, our lungs pumping and our hearts beating is all we have in this new realm

22:46.670 --> 22:56.850
That's right, our lungs pumping and our hearts beating is all we have in this new realm

22:56.850 --> 23:01.980

23:01.980 --> 23:08.780
We're awaiting the rising of a sun that none have yet witnessed

23:08.780 --> 23:14.700
Now that we're deliberating at a crossroads, paths blurring together

23:08.780 --> 23:14.700
Now that we're deliberating at a crossroads, paths blurring together

23:15.250 --> 23:17.330

23:15.250 --> 23:17.330
We can feel it

23:17.330 --> 23:22.460
Inside this uncharted world which has yet to take on a name

23:22.460 --> 23:28.720
As I'm waiting for the dawn to reach my eyes with a familiar light

23:28.720 --> 23:35.640
I'm reminded of days I won't return to, and seeking proof of newfound existence

23:35.640 --> 23:38.480
