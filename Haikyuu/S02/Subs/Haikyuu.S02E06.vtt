Whoa, I can't get that!

00:53.550 --> 00:57.320
Are you sure you're supposed to be moving
 around like that right after getting discharged?

00:54.570 --> 00:55.760

00:57.660 --> 00:58.520
What?

00:58.520 --> 01:02.860
If they let you out of the hospital, it means they're 
giving you permission to move around all you want.

I won't stop trying to find the best version of myself

02:11.160 --> 02:13.240

03:02.200 --> 03:05.870

03:07.540 --> 03:11.120
"Karasuno's Ukai" became famous all across the nation.

03:12.710 --> 03:15.570

03:15.570 --> 03:19.380
P-P-P-Please help me!

03:20.170 --> 03:21.260
With what?

03:21.680 --> 03:24.510
I don't go around smacking random people.

03:24.510 --> 03:26.100
Just weaklings.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.220
Damn you, old man...

03:28.560 --> 03:33.560
I-I came here to learn to fight on my own!

03:34.730 --> 03:38.320
You want to master mid-air combat at that height?

03:38.320 --> 03:39.990
I want to <i>because</i> of my height!

03:44.100 --> 03:47.200
I know it might sound weird, but...

03:48.120 --> 03:49.450
What's weird about it?

03:51.660 --> 03:54.750
Even if you're dealing with a prodigy of a setter,

03:55.230 --> 03:59.460
in the type of attack known as a fast attack, the one controlling the pace...

04:00.150 --> 04:01.010
is you.

04:03.760 --> 04:07.470
You're the coach! Don't look so dumbfounded, punk!

04:11.530 --> 04:14.560
Wh-What are you doing here, Oikawa?

04:14.560 --> 04:16.150
I'm watching my nephew.

04:16.150 --> 04:17.060
Hey!

04:17.060 --> 04:18.690
H-Hey...

04:18.690 --> 04:19.820
What about practice?

04:19.820 --> 04:21.990
We usually have Mondays off.

04:21.990 --> 04:25.030
Y-You guys get a break once a week? What a waste!

04:25.320 --> 04:27.780
Getting rest and ditching practice are two different things.

04:27.780 --> 04:28.450
See ya.

04:29.290 --> 04:31.250
O-Oikawa, um...

04:31.250 --> 04:32.320
Nope!

04:32.320 --> 04:34.830
Stupid! You're stupid! You stupid face!

04:34.830 --> 04:36.460
<i>I haven't even said anything yet.</i>

04:36.460 --> 04:37.370
Oikawa—

04:37.370 --> 04:40.420
Nope! Can't hear you! Can't hear a thing!

04:42.800 --> 04:45.890
I beg you, please listen to what I have to say.

04:45.890 --> 04:50.060
Why should I go out of my way to listen to what my opponent is going to say?

04:51.100 --> 04:52.680
Please, Oikawa!

04:53.340 --> 04:56.270
I beg you!

04:58.110 --> 05:01.030
I beg you, please!

05:05.530 --> 05:06.320
Takeru.

05:06.320 --> 05:07.070
What's up?

05:07.070 --> 05:08.240
Take a picture.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.540
Hold it like this, and press here.

05:10.540 --> 05:11.740
Don't move, Tobio.

05:11.740 --> 05:16.670
Yay! I'll call this "Tobio is No Match For Oikawa"!

05:17.630 --> 05:20.160
This picture actually makes you happy?

05:20.160 --> 05:21.350
Talk about lame.

05:23.460 --> 05:25.010
Well, what do you want?

05:25.010 --> 05:26.510
I'm busy, you know?

05:26.510 --> 05:29.080
You said you had free time since your girlfriend dumped you!

05:29.080 --> 05:31.560
Shut up, Takeru!

05:31.560 --> 05:34.220
What? But when you came, 
you said you didn't know what you did wrong.

05:34.220 --> 05:36.310
I told you to shut it!

05:36.960 --> 05:42.580
So, uh, what if you were close to a tournament, and, uh...

05:43.320 --> 05:46.650
And Iwaizumi said he was going to try some impossible attack...

05:46.650 --> 05:47.740
Hey.

05:47.740 --> 05:52.330
If you want to talk to me about something,
 quit with the lame hypotheticals and give it to me straight.

05:55.940 --> 06:02.240
Hinata said he wants to decide where to hit the fast attacks that he'd been hitting with his eyes closed.

06:02.240 --> 06:04.420
Oh, really? That'd be pretty impressive if he could.

06:04.420 --> 06:05.300
Why not let him?

06:05.300 --> 06:07.760
Please don't make it sound so easy!

06:07.760 --> 06:09.680
Hinata has nothing even approaching technique!

06:10.330 --> 06:14.140
So you're saying, "Just do what I tell you" or something?

06:14.140 --> 06:15.810
You sound like a dictator.

06:17.090 --> 06:22.610
Have you even thought about whether or not you're really giving Shorty the kind of set he wants?

06:23.270 --> 06:25.110
Have you even tried to?

06:26.100 --> 06:26.780
<i>Kageyama.</i>

06:28.820 --> 06:30.930
<i>Set for me.</i>

06:31.850 --> 06:36.910
You're basically a coward if you think the situation's as good as it can be and act defensive about it.

06:38.250 --> 06:39.710
Don't get the wrong idea.

06:40.500 --> 06:45.710
The one who has the initiative in an attack isn't you. It's Shorty.

06:48.610 --> 06:53.680
If you can't understand that, 
you've basically regressed back to being a dictator.

06:53.680 --> 06:54.970
Let's go, Takeru.

07:04.150 --> 07:05.730
Are you in a good mood, Tooru?

07:06.700 --> 07:10.640
I'm happy that Tobio's more run down that I thought he was.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.330
I'm totally blurry!

07:15.490 --> 07:18.660
It's not even about technique. 
It's a problem with your mindset.

07:19.870 --> 07:24.060
What do you personally think about that so-called deviant fast attack?

07:24.060 --> 07:29.050
Let's see... I run like, zoom,
 and with a bang I jump with all my might.

07:29.050 --> 07:35.600
That's where a set vrooms in, so I swing with a whoosh, and it perfectly hits my hand and slash! We nail it.

07:35.600 --> 07:41.980
Er, what he's trying to say is when he jumps with his eyes closed, our setter, Kageyama, sets the ball directly to—

07:41.980 --> 07:44.110
I get what you're trying to say.

07:44.650 --> 07:46.900
But you got it all wrong, Shrimp.

07:47.780 --> 07:53.860
Even for that deviant fast attack, as long as it's 
a type of fast attack, you still hold the initiative.

07:54.280 --> 07:57.330
Make sure you really understand that.

07:57.330 --> 08:00.040
Don't think of a weapon you wield as unfamiliar.

08:01.560 --> 08:05.080
Well, I guess it's faster to just show you.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.500
Shrimp, you try blocking for a bit.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.050
You're a middle blocker, right?

08:10.050 --> 08:11.220
Try stopping these.

08:12.590 --> 08:13.820
You're in junior high?

08:13.820 --> 08:14.640
Which school?

08:14.640 --> 08:16.300
I'm in high school!

08:16.720 --> 08:17.780
All right, here we go!

08:17.780 --> 08:19.320
Okay!

08:19.320 --> 08:21.430
<i>Is this height for grade schoolers?</i>

08:21.430 --> 08:23.230
<i>I feel a bit taller.</i>

08:24.840 --> 08:26.150
Third tempo!

08:26.610 --> 08:27.860
<i>"Third tempo"?</i>

08:34.780 --> 08:36.320
What an amazing jump!

08:36.320 --> 08:37.930
Your face was totally above the net.

08:37.930 --> 08:38.990
Well, yeah.

08:39.330 --> 08:42.200
You've definitely got some spring in your step.

08:42.550 --> 08:43.410
All right, next!

08:43.910 --> 08:45.120
Second tempo!

08:48.760 --> 08:50.710
<i>It's faster than before, but...</i>

08:54.520 --> 08:55.340
All right, next!

08:55.950 --> 08:57.050
First tempo!

09:06.980 --> 09:07.640
Well?

09:07.640 --> 09:08.730
It's fast!

09:08.730 --> 09:09.800
Think you could block that?

09:09.800 --> 09:13.280
I doubt one person could handle it. Um, sir!

09:13.920 --> 09:18.450
In the three tempos you just saw, 
was there a big difference in how the spiker hit?

09:18.450 --> 09:20.330
No, I don't think so.... sir!

09:20.700 --> 09:22.120
Then what was different?

09:31.200 --> 09:34.010
The timing of their running approach?

09:34.340 --> 09:36.470
Correct! That's what tempo is.

09:37.430 --> 09:38.390
Listen.

09:38.390 --> 09:42.200
The speed of an attack is determined by its tempo.

09:42.200 --> 09:45.520
It's not how fast or slow the set may be,

09:45.520 --> 09:49.060
it's the timing of the spiker's running approach.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.320
The fastest is first tempo.

09:52.870 --> 09:56.000
It's the best way to get around a block,

09:56.000 --> 09:59.160
and it's probably the attack you were doing without realizing it.

09:59.560 --> 10:03.540
But you need to really understand it.

10:04.350 --> 10:07.670
You need to start your running
 approach before the set goes up.

10:07.670 --> 10:11.170
The setter sets to the spiker.

10:12.210 --> 10:16.340
In other words, the deviant fast attack is still an attack with the initiative on the spiker.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.890
First... tempo.

10:21.860 --> 10:22.890
And so...

10:23.640 --> 10:27.310
I don't know what kind of special attack the deviant fast attack is,

10:27.640 --> 10:29.560
but there's one thing I'm certain of.

10:30.220 --> 10:34.530
There's no better set than one the spiker can easily hit.

10:43.710 --> 10:45.450
Just one of them is no good.

10:45.450 --> 10:46.120
Huh?

10:46.120 --> 10:48.160
Hinata, practice here for a bit!

10:48.160 --> 10:49.370
S-Sure.

10:49.370 --> 10:51.290
What a weirdo.

10:53.290 --> 10:57.420
The timing of the spiker's running approach is everything.

10:58.940 --> 11:04.650
One centimeter, one millimeter, one second faster to the peak...

11:05.690 --> 11:08.530
But that's not enough.

11:08.530 --> 11:12.980
Until now, the only thing I decided 
on my own was to jump to the peak.

11:14.440 --> 11:18.610
But in the future, you also want to fight at the peak.

11:21.160 --> 11:25.620
In order for that to happen, your partner's gonna need some improvement as well.

11:26.320 --> 11:29.830
But I'm pretty sure Keishin is
 gonna do something about that.

11:30.930 --> 11:34.540
Kageyama's really amazing, so I'm sure he'll make it work.

11:35.970 --> 11:38.340
I don't want to be left behind,

11:39.170 --> 11:42.220
so please teach me how to fight at the peak.

11:46.760 --> 11:48.470
Don't get the wrong idea.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.690
The one who has the initiative in an attack isn't you. It's Shorty.

11:54.310 --> 11:59.110
If you can't understand that, 
you've basically regressed back to being a dictator.

12:03.950 --> 12:04.620
Yes, hello—

12:04.340 --> 12:06.450
<i>Kageyama! Where are you right now?!</i>

12:06.450 --> 12:07.820
Mr. Ukai?

12:07.820 --> 12:09.790
I'm heading to the school right now.

12:09.790 --> 12:11.460
<i>What?!</i>

12:11.460 --> 12:14.380
I wanted to check out if they 
were done inspecting the gym.

12:14.380 --> 12:15.580
Ah!

12:15.580 --> 12:17.420
Kageyama!

12:17.420 --> 12:18.340
Whoa!

12:18.700 --> 12:21.010
Don't overshoot it! Let it drop!

12:21.340 --> 12:22.220
I'm sorry?!

12:23.180 --> 12:24.550
A set that stops!

12:26.260 --> 12:33.060
<b>!!</b>

12:26.260 --> 12:33.060

12:41.570 --> 12:42.780
Shrimp,

12:43.530 --> 12:49.490
if you're gonna fight at the peak on your own,
 you're gonna have to start with the fundamentals.

12:50.080 --> 12:54.080
So, from now on, you'll keep making fast attacks.

12:54.080 --> 12:56.460
You need to earnestly make up for the practice you lack.

12:56.460 --> 12:58.250
Hello!

12:56.460 --> 12:58.250
Heyo!

12:58.250 --> 12:59.800
There you are.

12:59.800 --> 13:01.170
Hi!

13:01.710 --> 13:06.140
Your task for the foreseeable future is to be 
able to do first-tempo spikes with any setter.

13:06.140 --> 13:07.090
Got it!

13:07.770 --> 13:09.140
A newbie?

13:07.770 --> 13:12.600
Your setter prodigy isn't here to set to you, 
so it's not gonna be easy.

13:09.140 --> 13:11.770
He's in junior... Oh, he's in high school.

13:12.600 --> 13:13.560
Right!

13:14.060 --> 13:18.520
Also, in order to get used to the ball, you need to always be touching it.

13:18.520 --> 13:19.440
Always.

13:20.230 --> 13:21.390
Yessir.

13:21.390 --> 13:23.030
I don't care if you use your hand or foot.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.200
Volleyball is a sport where you can't hold the ball.

13:26.200 --> 13:29.700
You're only allowed to touch the ball for a few seconds.

13:31.040 --> 13:36.460
You need to control that moment as 
though the ball were a part of your body.

13:37.240 --> 13:40.670
Because you're small, you need to 
make up for it with everything else.

13:40.670 --> 13:41.920
Right!

13:41.920 --> 13:45.170
<b>Foot of the Slope</b>

13:43.630 --> 13:45.170
Tempo?

13:47.410 --> 13:48.510
Welcome.

13:47.710 --> 13:53.100
Well, I know the basic theory behind it, 
but I was never able to apply it.

13:53.770 --> 13:56.560
I treated your fast attack as something special,

13:56.560 --> 13:58.900
and because of that I almost
 forgot something fundamental.

13:59.650 --> 14:01.770
I think I have a good idea what tempo is now,

14:02.360 --> 14:04.190
but what do you mean by "a set that stops"?

14:05.430 --> 14:06.860
Okay, first...

14:07.240 --> 14:12.160
When you're setting for your deviant fast attack, 
it's a set that passes through the spiker's point of impact.

14:09.370 --> 14:13.990
m 0 0 l 150 0 150 150 0 150

14:09.370 --> 14:13.990
<b>Point of
 Impact</b>

14:12.910 --> 14:13.580
Right.

14:14.330 --> 14:16.460
But I want you to stop it right there!

14:16.460 --> 14:17.790
Right at the point of impact!

14:19.560 --> 14:21.000
So, basically...

14:21.660 --> 14:26.630
You make it so that the spiker's highest impact point equals the peak of the ball's trajectory.

14:28.720 --> 14:32.640
Don't use so much force that the ball passes through the spiker's point of impact.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.850
Use just enough force to reach 
the point of impact, and then...

14:35.300 --> 14:36.520
Kill it?

14:38.290 --> 14:43.130
The difficulty in controlling your power and how much backspin you put on it isn't going to be like before.

14:43.130 --> 14:46.240
Not to mention B Quick, D Quick, and broad jumps...

14:46.240 --> 14:49.490
The farther out you get, the more difficult they'll become.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.040
Think you can do it?

14:52.780 --> 14:56.200
<i>Are you really giving Shorty the kind of set he wants?</i>

14:56.850 --> 14:58.960
<i>Have you even tried to?</i>

15:00.300 --> 15:01.630
I'll definitely try.

15:06.480 --> 15:07.630
Tanaka!

15:08.010 --> 15:08.760
Oh?

15:08.760 --> 15:11.630
I-I'm sorry about the other day!

15:11.630 --> 15:14.300
No problem! Kageyama just came by too.

15:14.300 --> 15:15.850
I'm sorry for hitting you guys.

15:15.850 --> 15:18.180
Stop!

15:18.180 --> 15:21.400
I got too worked up trying to stop you guys from fighting.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.560
I really felt your punch!

15:23.560 --> 15:26.900
But you shouldn't be fighting in front of girls!

15:26.900 --> 15:29.200
Yacchan's face was as pale as a ghost.

15:27.820 --> 15:29.200
T-T-Tanaka!

15:29.200 --> 15:32.280
They're gonna die! They're gonna die!

15:30.990 --> 15:32.280
Who's gonna die? You're scaring me!

15:32.860 --> 15:35.380
Also, you shouldn't fight in front of the veep, either!

15:35.380 --> 15:36.740
Do it anywhere else!

15:36.740 --> 15:37.870
Yessir!

15:37.870 --> 15:39.830
Hinata, come here a sec.

15:41.540 --> 15:42.210
All right.

15:42.850 --> 15:46.170
You'll be on the B team for our practice matches for a while.

15:46.570 --> 15:47.670
He's all yours, Sugawara!

15:48.340 --> 15:48.880
Yes, sir!

15:49.760 --> 15:51.240
All right, let's get this started!

15:51.240 --> 15:52.340
Make sure you stay hydrated!

15:52.340 --> 15:54.050
Yessir!

15:59.500 --> 16:01.020
Um, Hinata...

16:01.990 --> 16:05.360
U-Um, I was wondering if you were okay...

16:05.360 --> 16:08.820
Things between you and Kageyama, I mean, um, uh...

16:10.820 --> 16:12.030
We're fine.

16:20.950 --> 16:22.660
Class 1-3

16:21.540 --> 16:22.660
Yui!

16:22.660 --> 16:24.710
Sawamura's here.

16:26.640 --> 16:27.840
What?

16:27.840 --> 16:28.630
Hey...

16:29.090 --> 16:35.370
I was wondering if we could borrow the gym after 
you guys are done, even if it's just for a little while.

16:35.370 --> 16:37.800
Oh, sure. I'll go ask.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.140
Is something wrong with the second gymnasium?

16:40.140 --> 16:41.680
No, it's just...

16:42.100 --> 16:46.560
A lot of the guys are practicing on their own, 
so we don't have enough space.

16:48.190 --> 16:49.270
Damn it.

16:52.150 --> 16:54.660
<i>Serving is the ultimate attack.</i>

16:55.700 --> 17:00.490
<i>Right now, the only person on the team who 
can consistently do a jump serve is Kageyama.</i>

17:01.410 --> 17:04.460
<i>Mine aren't as consistent, so I can't do it when it counts.</i>

17:04.460 --> 17:06.060
<i>But that means...</i>

17:06.060 --> 17:07.880
<i>I can't call it a weapon!</i>

17:08.290 --> 17:10.460
Asahi!

17:14.720 --> 17:15.840
Mind if I join you?

17:15.840 --> 17:17.890
Oh, yeah. Sure.

17:17.890 --> 17:20.560
<i>He shows up and nonchalantly digs that one out too. Damn.</i>

17:21.270 --> 17:24.270
Would you mind hitting some of my sets?

17:24.560 --> 17:26.220
Yeah, sure.

17:27.520 --> 17:28.690
Uh, wait, what?

17:29.240 --> 17:31.400
You're going to set?

17:31.940 --> 17:33.110
<i>Is he...</i>

17:33.740 --> 17:35.860
<i>going to try what Seijou's libero did?</i>

17:36.570 --> 17:38.950
I'll help you with your serving practice in return!

17:39.630 --> 17:41.910
<i>I can't just let myself fall behind.</i>

17:42.330 --> 17:43.630
Sure. Let's do this.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.120
All right!

17:45.120 --> 17:47.040
We'll leave the rest up to you guys.

17:56.170 --> 17:57.510
They all started moving at once.

17:58.210 --> 18:01.390
Shinzen did an attack like this too.

18:01.390 --> 18:02.600
Um...

18:03.020 --> 18:04.810

18:15.320 --> 18:16.320

but my name isn't "Shrimp."

18:29.440 --> 18:31.880
Those with no skill are nothing more than shrimps!

18:35.280 --> 18:36.630
Come on! Let's go, Shrimp!

18:37.130 --> 18:38.300
I'm ready!

18:42.180 --> 18:44.600
Turn all your attention to jumping at full strength!

18:51.360 --> 18:53.190
There you go.

18:53.190 --> 18:57.780
You need to be able to hit the ball at any time at will,
 regardless of who the setter is.

18:57.780 --> 18:58.570
Yessir!

19:02.950 --> 19:06.160
Don't try to line up with the ball! Jump on your own timing!

19:06.620 --> 19:09.620
Fight on your own, without anyone's help!

19:11.380 --> 19:12.630

19:19.640 --> 19:22.300

Oh, sorry! It might be a bit short!

20:38.000 --> 20:40.380
Amazing! Nice cover, Shou!

20:41.720 --> 20:45.090
Before, if the timing was off even a little bit, you started panicking.

20:41.720 --> 20:46.050
Oh no. Oh no.

20:45.090 --> 20:46.050
Shut up!

20:46.600 --> 20:51.760
Until now, I was spiking without giving it 
much thought thanks to an amazing setter.

20:51.760 --> 20:56.310
But now, since everyone's techniques and quirks are different, I have to handle them all mid-air.

20:57.460 --> 21:00.480
Though just a little, I can see the ball better than I did before.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.900
Munchkin, help me out a bit over here!

21:04.740 --> 21:06.880
The nickname went from "Shrimp" to "Munchkin"!

21:06.880 --> 21:07.950
He's been promoted!

21:07.950 --> 21:09.160
Is that really a promotion?

21:11.950 --> 21:14.140
You're going to Tokyo in two days, aren't ya?

21:14.140 --> 21:15.460
Nekoma's coming too, right?

21:15.460 --> 21:16.630
Yes.

21:16.630 --> 21:20.190
Our advisor told us that Coach Nekomata's the one who invited us over.

21:20.190 --> 21:24.590
He's a bothersome old chap, 
but his eye for volleyball is definitely genuine.

21:25.560 --> 21:30.010
His players won't be able to be dealt with by any ordinary means, either.

21:31.260 --> 21:33.270
Go get yourself knocked out till you feel sick!

21:33.870 --> 21:34.640
Yes, sir!

<b>First Gymnasium</b>

21:35.480 --> 21:37.190
<b>First Gymnasium</b>

21:40.270 --> 21:41.400
All right!

21:41.940 --> 21:43.630
Next, please!

21:43.630 --> 21:44.780
You got it!

21:48.660 --> 21:53.290
Now, as it's summer vacation, 
we can practice from morning to night.

21:53.620 --> 21:57.040
And starting tomorrow, 
we'll resume the Tokyo away games.

22:00.230 --> 22:02.590
This time, we'll be there for a solid week!

22:02.590 --> 22:06.220
This training camp is the last and most important one before the spring tournament preliminaries.

22:07.010 --> 22:09.430
As we approach the preliminaries, to make sure we have no regrets...

22:10.090 --> 22:12.750
let's take this opportunity to devour everything down!

22:15.020 --> 22:15.020
{ED}

22:28.030 --> 22:33.600
We climb the mountain in our way

22:34.120 --> 22:40.170
Losing more than just time in the process

22:40.170 --> 22:46.180
Tasting freedom makes us want to fly

22:46.300 --> 22:52.240
And notice the feelings welling up inside

22:52.520 --> 22:55.650
It's almost in our reach

22:55.650 --> 22:58.730
The closer we get, the more it shines

22:58.730 --> 23:01.520
And stretches out in front of our eyes

23:01.520 --> 23:04.890
That panorama created just for us

23:04.890 --> 23:11.160
Until I reach the top and come back down, my lungs will keep breathing

23:11.160 --> 23:17.420
But now I've been possessed by the desire to climb that summit once again

23:17.420 --> 23:23.270
We cast aside all our doubt and set flight to the skies

23:23.270 --> 23:30.430
Our flailing hands reach out and grab hold of the moment

23:31.790 --> 23:33.430
That special moment

23:34.900 --> 23:39.410
Come to us climbers

23:39.960 --> 23:42.150
Come to us right now

23:53.410 --> 23:54.320
