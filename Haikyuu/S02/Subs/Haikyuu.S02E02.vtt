00:01.730 --> 00:03.400
As I'm sure you are aware,

00:04.330 --> 00:07.930
you have final exams starting next month.

00:10.380 --> 00:11.670
You <i>are</i> aware, right?

00:12.480 --> 00:16.030
So, and I think you know what I'm getting at,

00:16.380 --> 00:18.790
if you fail any subjects...

00:20.680 --> 00:22.370
Supplementary classes will be held on weekends.

00:22.910 --> 00:25.580
If necessary, they will be held during summer break as well.

00:25.580 --> 00:28.340
Going to the away games would be physically impossible.

00:30.650 --> 00:32.920
Hey! There's nowhere to run!

00:32.920 --> 00:34.220
Ennoshita, grab them!

00:34.220 --> 00:34.840
Got it!

00:35.550 --> 00:37.390
Fail... Fail...

00:37.390 --> 00:38.510
What counts as a failing grade?

00:38.510 --> 00:39.220
That's your question?!

00:40.910 --> 00:42.430
Kageyama isn't breathing!

00:43.040 --> 00:45.480
Since we said we're going to stay on the team,

00:45.480 --> 00:47.440
we have to at least make decent grades.

00:47.440 --> 00:49.230
You shouldn't fail your finals.

00:49.230 --> 00:50.150
Nope.

00:50.150 --> 00:53.980
M-Maybe if we beg the vice principal as hard as we can...

00:53.980 --> 00:57.620
You should try as hard as you can to not fail your finals instead.

00:57.620 --> 01:00.370
Even if we get the vice principal's permission,

01:00.370 --> 01:03.330
if any of you have to take supplementary classes, 
those will take priority.

01:06.790 --> 01:08.000
Coach!

01:08.000 --> 01:11.640
W-Well, this isn't something you're gonna be able to avoid as a student.

01:11.640 --> 01:12.670
But...

01:12.670 --> 01:14.550
Don't give up! You need to believe you can do it!

01:14.550 --> 01:15.760
Mind over matter?!

01:15.760 --> 01:18.300
No, that's fine.

01:18.300 --> 01:19.530
Please teach me!

01:20.670 --> 01:24.480
Hinata, I didn't really want to bring this up,

01:25.160 --> 01:28.190
but do I look like someone who got good grades?

01:31.320 --> 01:35.740
Hinata, I'm sure you don't have to worry this much about it.

01:35.740 --> 01:40.480
I've never gotten a double-digit score on any of my quizzes.

01:40.480 --> 01:41.530
Will I still be okay?

01:41.530 --> 01:43.240
Huh?

01:45.100 --> 01:47.250
Hey! Praying isn't going to help, you two!

01:48.290 --> 01:51.250
They can do it if they try. They can do it if they try.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.840
Pull yourself together, Mr. Takeda!

01:51.980 --> 01:53.630
Ah, the sound of anguish.

01:54.060 --> 01:55.210
Get a hold of yourselves!

01:56.380 --> 01:58.680
We still have time until finals.

01:58.680 --> 02:02.310
There's no way we can play our best without these four idiots!

02:02.640 --> 02:03.850
Not a chance!

02:03.850 --> 02:06.550
I don't know if I'm flattered or insulted...

02:07.870 --> 02:09.240
We're gonna do this.

02:09.240 --> 02:12.410
We're all gonna go to Tokyo.

02:12.980 --> 02:12.980
{OP}

02:22.030 --> 02:26.920
I keep running as I run out of breath

02:26.920 --> 02:31.830
With dreams on my mind and a fire in my belly

02:26.950 --> 02:31.830

I feel like I'll be left behind in this world

02:36.760 --> 02:41.430
If I come to a standstill

02:41.890 --> 02:46.600
People ask me why I find joy in this

02:46.600 --> 02:51.180
But I don't understand it myself

02:51.650 --> 02:56.070
Running is the only thing on my mind

02:56.070 --> 03:00.240
Even if nothing goes right in the future

03:00.240 --> 03:05.870
I won't stop trying to find the best version of myself

03:05.870 --> 03:10.170
Even if someone tells me that this is as far as I go

03:10.170 --> 03:12.250
And draws the line on me

03:12.250 --> 03:16.190
I'll say no, thank you, and surge on ahead

03:16.840 --> 03:17.680
So what?

03:17.680 --> 03:19.300
Whatever the future may bring

03:19.300 --> 03:20.010
So what?

03:20.010 --> 03:21.800
However people are supposed to act

03:21.800 --> 03:22.540
So what?

03:22.540 --> 03:26.240
It doesn't really matter

03:28.220 --> 03:31.170
So I'm a believer

03:33.150 --> 03:38.950
So I'm a believer

Episode Two:
 Direct Sunlight

03:43.570 --> 03:48.700
Episode Two:
 Direct Sunlight

03:46.740 --> 03:48.120
Listen up, you guys.

03:48.120 --> 03:51.380
The one thing that you're going to promise me right now...

03:52.880 --> 03:54.860
is that you will not fall asleep in class.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.340
That's top priority?

03:56.340 --> 03:58.780
Staying up late through sheer willpower.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.720
Screwing up in your classes and in practice.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.160
It's all completely absurd!

04:04.160 --> 04:05.260
Right...

04:05.640 --> 04:07.350
We're heading out.

04:07.350 --> 04:09.750
R-Right. Good job.

04:11.430 --> 04:12.810
It'll be all right.

04:12.810 --> 04:15.440
I mean, you guys passed your high school entrance exams.

04:16.160 --> 04:17.230
Suga!

04:17.230 --> 04:20.490
If you fall asleep in class, you'd better be prepared for the consequences.

04:24.450 --> 04:25.450
Kageyama.

04:28.140 --> 04:29.790
What? No way!

04:29.790 --> 04:31.450
You have no right to be picky!

04:31.450 --> 04:33.870
If we fail our finals, we can't go on the trip!

04:33.870 --> 04:35.000
We're playing Nekoma!

04:35.000 --> 04:37.050
And all the powerhouses in Tokyo are gonna be there!

04:37.050 --> 04:38.400
You're okay with not being able to go?!

04:38.400 --> 04:41.790
You told Ushiwaka that you'd become the best setter!

04:45.430 --> 04:49.430
<b>Foot of the Slope</b>

04:46.730 --> 04:49.430
I'm actually surprised that Kageyama's grades are bad.

04:49.980 --> 04:52.270
He seems pretty smart.

04:52.270 --> 04:54.520
Hinata's grades don't surprise me at all, though.

04:54.520 --> 04:58.560
I'm sure all that's in his head is volleyball.

04:58.560 --> 04:59.900
Tsukishima!

05:01.020 --> 05:01.870
Sir.

05:02.820 --> 05:04.610
Help us study...

05:04.610 --> 05:05.820
Please.

05:05.820 --> 05:07.870
What? No.

05:09.030 --> 05:10.950
Just, like, an hour each day!

05:10.950 --> 05:13.540
Or maybe tell us how to study...

05:14.830 --> 05:17.670
I think it'd be all right if you did a little bit before and after practice.

05:19.500 --> 05:24.010
Hey, isn't it unfair for you to make the little one do all the begging?

05:24.010 --> 05:25.800
I'm talking to you, big guy.

05:26.970 --> 05:28.890
Kageyama, ask him!

05:31.660 --> 05:33.020
Please teach us.

05:33.020 --> 05:34.140
What was that?

05:34.770 --> 05:36.890
Please teach us how to study.

05:36.890 --> 05:39.480
I don't think I quite heard you.

05:39.480 --> 05:41.150
Studying!

05:41.150 --> 05:44.030
I'm asking you to teach us how, goddammit!

05:44.030 --> 05:46.740
Shut the hell up! You're disturbing the neighborhood!

05:46.740 --> 05:48.700
S-Sorry!

05:48.700 --> 05:50.450
Why am <i>I</i> getting yelled at?

06:00.370 --> 06:01.540
Sorry.

06:01.540 --> 06:03.170
It's okay. Thank you, though.

06:03.170 --> 06:04.590
Shimizu!

06:04.960 --> 06:09.050
I found some people in other classes that haven't joined a club yet.

06:09.640 --> 06:10.890
Thanks!

06:10.890 --> 06:12.430
Yes, no!

06:12.430 --> 06:14.000
<i>"Yes, no"?</i>

06:15.300 --> 06:16.430
<i>She smiled!</i>

06:17.620 --> 06:22.730
U-Um, doing all of the manager's duties by yourself must be hard, right?

06:23.110 --> 06:25.420
If there's anything a first-year can do, I'd be happy to help.

06:27.450 --> 06:32.450
{=0}We're going to the Spring Tournament!

06:28.450 --> 06:32.450
We third-years are going to be 
gone after the next tournament.

06:32.780 --> 06:34.450
Watching all of you get better,

06:34.450 --> 06:38.370
it made me reconsider what'll happen next year and the year after that.

06:38.930 --> 06:41.830
I still have things I need to do.

06:42.170 --> 06:43.790
I-I'll gladly help!

06:44.500 --> 06:47.550
Thanks, but you should focus on studying.

06:48.030 --> 06:49.530
That and practice, of course.

06:50.470 --> 06:53.470
Everyone's looking forward to the greatest decoy.

06:54.260 --> 06:55.060
Right!

06:57.580 --> 06:59.890
All right, let's move on to the next one.

06:59.890 --> 07:02.650
Hinata, what's the first answer to question 6?

07:00.390 --> 07:02.650
For this, you do this to get this.

07:04.720 --> 07:10.110
<i>Question six: Please insert the correct word or phrase that goes in the parentheses to correctly complete the idiom.</i>

07:13.040 --> 07:19.000
<i>This idiom expresses that even ruthless people can show compassion or even cry at times.</i>

07:19.490 --> 07:21.170
<i>Even ogres can be moved to...</i>

07:21.170 --> 07:22.460
...an iron club?

07:24.130 --> 07:25.840
That's gotta hurt!

07:25.840 --> 07:28.050
Hey, how could you do that to the ogre?

07:28.050 --> 07:30.300
You're thinking of another idiom.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.130
Did you not read the explanation?

07:32.130 --> 07:33.840
Oh, shut up.

07:33.840 --> 07:37.520
You probably saw the word "ogre," didn't read the rest, and just wrote the first thing that came to mind.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.100
You really are a simpleton.

07:39.100 --> 07:41.770
Yeah. You need to calm down.

07:41.770 --> 07:42.770
You're too careless.

07:42.770 --> 07:45.060
Do you all have to comment on it?!

07:45.770 --> 07:48.400
You're one to talk, Kageyama!

07:48.400 --> 07:51.360
Aren't you even worse off than Hinata overall?

07:51.360 --> 07:54.410
You should at least memorize 
English vocabulary by yourself.

07:54.410 --> 07:56.410
Why would Japanese people 
be able to understand English?

07:56.410 --> 07:59.160
Then you should give up on going to Tokyo.

07:59.160 --> 08:00.120
Kageyama.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.040
B Quick.

08:04.580 --> 08:08.210
A, C, delayed attack in front of the setter,

08:08.210 --> 08:09.460
left-side back row attack,

08:09.800 --> 08:13.840
D, parallel, semi, delayed attack behind the setter.

08:14.680 --> 08:15.430
Man, that's fast.

08:15.900 --> 08:17.890
How long did it take you to memorize those?

08:19.280 --> 08:21.350
I think it was the same day we were taught them?

08:21.350 --> 08:25.480
Then I won't let you use "I can't 
memorize the words" as an excuse.

08:25.480 --> 08:26.610
<i>C-Crap.</i>

08:27.110 --> 08:29.030
I-I'm not gonna lose to you, Kageyama!

08:29.030 --> 08:31.860
All right. Let's go to my place after practice on Saturday.

08:31.860 --> 08:32.840
Sounds good.

08:35.070 --> 08:39.080
I'm not gonna lose to them, either!

08:36.700 --> 08:39.700
Like I said, you really need to calm down.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.630
Nishinoya, let me see your quiz from yesterday.

08:46.430 --> 08:47.380
Snacks!

08:47.980 --> 08:51.550
For Japanese, the answer is basically found somewhere within the problem text.

08:51.550 --> 08:53.340
So if you read the passage carefully...

08:53.640 --> 09:00.850
<i>Question 3: Copy the sentence from the passage that most exemplifies the two contradictory feelings Norio has.</i>

09:03.100 --> 09:05.730
<i>Live more like a man, Norio!</i>

09:06.140 --> 09:08.690
The problem says you have to copy a sentence from the passage!

09:08.690 --> 09:10.880
Don't ignore both the problem and Norio!

09:10.880 --> 09:12.690
You're so awesome, Noya.

09:14.030 --> 09:15.820

12:57.080 --> 12:57.920
Yes!

12:58.790 --> 13:00.750
Sh-She hasn't actually joined yet.

13:00.750 --> 13:06.260
I suddenly asked her to come by 
today before her committee meeting,

13:06.260 --> 13:07.800
so she's just dropping in to say hi.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.680
I-It's a pleasure to meet you!

13:10.140 --> 13:11.680
Same!

13:11.680 --> 13:14.770
Could you not surround her like that until she's more comfortable?

13:15.730 --> 13:17.860
S-Sorry for the intrusion.

13:19.590 --> 13:20.800
Shimizu.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.860
So you were looking for a new manager, huh?

13:23.860 --> 13:24.800
Yes.

13:24.800 --> 13:28.820
I thought we didn't get enough responses when we tried to find people in April.

13:29.280 --> 13:32.480
I thought it was important to find someone to carry on as manager,

13:32.480 --> 13:36.500
especially with Karasuno getting so much stronger.

13:36.960 --> 13:38.120
Shimizu!

13:38.120 --> 13:38.750
Huh?

13:40.130 --> 13:42.210
Kiyoko!

13:42.670 --> 13:45.590
<i>I just came on a whim, but there were so many giant guys!</i>

13:45.590 --> 13:47.340
<i>What am I going to do tomorrow?</i>

13:48.430 --> 13:51.460
<i>I stood next to that pretty lady for like two minutes!</i>

13:51.460 --> 13:54.180
<i>What if her fans try to kill me?!</i>

14:01.590 --> 14:02.650
What's the matter?

14:07.310 --> 14:08.910
<i>Blond hair and pierced ears!</i>

14:08.910 --> 14:10.530
<i>Even a guy like this is a fan of hers?!</i>

14:10.530 --> 14:13.040
I-I'm going to be murdered!

14:14.950 --> 14:16.460
What? Murdered...

14:17.030 --> 14:19.080
I'm starving.

14:19.080 --> 14:21.040
<b>Class 1-4</b>

14:19.580 --> 14:21.040
Let's go to Foot of the Slope!

14:21.640 --> 14:24.760
Didn't we agree it was going to be
 only right before and after practice?

14:25.060 --> 14:25.880
Right?

14:26.780 --> 14:28.990
But the English teacher, Mr. Yoshida, wasn't around—

14:28.990 --> 14:32.620
Please come back during business hours.

14:33.970 --> 14:37.940
<b>Class 1-4</b>

14:34.610 --> 14:36.770
Damn it, Tsukishima's so stingy.

14:36.770 --> 14:37.940
Stingyshima!

14:38.450 --> 14:40.190
I have to do something...

14:40.190 --> 14:41.450
Hinata!

14:42.650 --> 14:44.440
You're gonna teach me, Yamaguchi?

14:44.440 --> 14:46.780
Sorry, I suck at English.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.280
Remember the potential manager who came yesterday?

14:50.740 --> 14:54.030
She said she was in class 5, 
so she might be good at studying.

14:54.030 --> 14:57.410
That's right. Classes 4 and 5 are the advanced classes.

14:59.290 --> 15:01.740
<i>What should I do after school?</i>

15:01.740 --> 15:02.790
<i>The volleyball team, huh?</i>

15:02.790 --> 15:03.890
Yachi!

15:04.880 --> 15:06.550
Pardon us.

15:06.550 --> 15:09.380
<i>Huh? What? Some guys from the volleyball team?</i>

15:09.380 --> 15:11.330
<i>What should I do? What do they want?</i>

15:11.330 --> 15:12.860
<i>Did they introduce themselves to me yet?</i>

15:12.860 --> 15:15.510
<i>Their names... What were their names again?</i>

15:15.510 --> 15:18.850
<i>How could I have forgotten them already?</i>

15:19.210 --> 15:21.020
You can't even remember names?!

15:22.350 --> 15:24.570
<i>I won't be able to make it in society and lose my job...</i>

15:25.090 --> 15:27.000
<i>I'll be out cold in the streets..</i>

15:27.000 --> 15:28.780
And in the end sell off my internal organs!

15:28.780 --> 15:30.950
I'm Hinata Shouyou from class 1!

15:31.950 --> 15:33.380
This is Kageyama.

15:33.380 --> 15:34.370
Hey.

15:34.370 --> 15:35.700
H-Hey.

15:35.700 --> 15:37.160
Yachi, do you like studying?

15:38.370 --> 15:39.870
I don't hate it.

15:40.160 --> 15:42.730
Could you teach me this English?

15:42.730 --> 15:44.580
You should ask her too, Kageyama!

15:44.580 --> 15:45.980
Please teach us.

15:45.980 --> 15:49.840
If we fail any tests next month, 
we won't be able to go to the Tokyo away games!

15:50.160 --> 15:53.860
So we've been getting tutored by a tall guy with glasses named Tsukishima...

15:53.860 --> 15:55.440
Why can't you do this?

15:55.440 --> 15:58.890
But he's been getting mad lately because Kageyama and I are too stupid for him.

15:58.890 --> 16:00.790
He doesn't scare me.

16:00.790 --> 16:03.060
But it'd be better if someone nice taught us, right?

16:03.690 --> 16:05.770
I-If you think I'm good enough...

16:05.770 --> 16:06.660
Really?!

16:06.660 --> 16:07.520
Yeah.

16:07.940 --> 16:12.430
But I'm not sure if I can be nicer than the tall guy with glasses.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.490
You definitely don't have to worry about that.

16:14.830 --> 16:15.900
Wow!

16:15.900 --> 16:17.950
I see! Wow!

16:17.950 --> 16:19.910
Oh, it's nothing...

16:20.620 --> 16:24.170
Your notes are really easy to read, Yachi! And you draw really well too!

16:24.470 --> 16:28.670
My mom works at a design firm, 
so she's always been picky about things like this.

16:29.170 --> 16:32.760
Oh, if you leave a space here, it'll be easier to fill in later.

16:32.760 --> 16:35.970
Also, if you use only a few colors, it won't get confusing.

16:35.970 --> 16:36.970
And...

16:36.970 --> 16:39.140
I'm sorry! I was writing all over your notebook!

16:39.140 --> 16:41.590
Oh, I see... You're amazing!

16:41.590 --> 16:44.650
I-It's nothing... Nothing at all...

16:45.530 --> 16:46.860
So, Hinata Shouyou...

16:46.860 --> 16:47.960
Just Hinata's fine.

16:47.960 --> 16:50.570
D-Do you not like studying, Hinata?

16:51.150 --> 16:52.460
I hate it.

16:52.460 --> 16:54.780
Sitting for a long time like this sucks.

16:54.780 --> 16:58.410
But aren't you working hard so that you can go on this trip to Tokyo?

16:58.410 --> 17:02.000
Yeah! We're gonna have practice matches
 with all the powerhouse schools from Tokyo!

17:03.000 --> 17:04.480
That's amazing.

17:04.480 --> 17:08.210
I've never been that serious about anything before.

17:08.210 --> 17:13.580
There's this school called Nekoma High School in Tokyo, and the setter for their team is super-smart.

17:13.580 --> 17:17.320
The captain with the rooster head is, 
like, huge and evil-looking.

17:17.320 --> 17:20.980
And there's a guy that's totally awesome at digging out one receive after another like "foom"!

17:20.980 --> 17:22.930
Nekoma's libero is awesome.

17:23.350 --> 17:25.040
He's on par with Nishinoya.

17:23.350 --> 17:25.040
<i>Setter?</i>

17:25.040 --> 17:27.100
There are a lot of amazing guys!

17:25.040 --> 17:27.760
<i>Rooster head? Libero?</i>

17:27.100 --> 17:29.110
Not just in Tokyo, but even in our prefecture.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.110
<i>Are these positions?</i>

17:29.420 --> 17:32.230
There's the Great King over at Aoba Jousai,

17:32.230 --> 17:34.830
Ushiwaka, who people call the greatest of all time,

17:34.830 --> 17:37.520
and Date Tech's Iron Wall that's 190 cm tall!

17:37.520 --> 17:38.870
190 centimeters?!

17:39.490 --> 17:42.320
Um... Hinata, are you a manager too?

17:42.320 --> 17:42.830
Why?

17:44.020 --> 17:47.030
I thought only tall people played volleyball,

17:47.030 --> 17:49.750
and the team was full of tall guys.

17:50.850 --> 17:54.050
I may be short, b-but I'm a starter!

17:54.360 --> 17:57.510
<i>Oh my god! I can't believe I judged someone by their appearance!</i>

17:58.010 --> 17:59.290
I'm so sorry!

17:59.290 --> 18:01.220
It's okay. I'm used to it.

18:01.500 --> 18:02.810
Even if I'm not tall,

18:04.750 --> 18:05.920
I can fly!

18:09.450 --> 18:12.340
Hinata, don't you need to copy this down?

18:12.340 --> 18:13.650
Oh, yeah.

18:15.930 --> 18:18.360
Everyone's so tall and looks really intimidating,

18:18.360 --> 18:23.450
but when we play them,
 I feel like I can really take them on.

18:24.120 --> 18:26.750
It's exciting and nerve-racking.

18:27.370 --> 18:31.000
It's amazing that you can stand toe-to-toe with them.

18:32.020 --> 18:34.420
That makes you a Little Giant, Hinata.

18:34.740 --> 18:35.100
Huh?!

18:35.100 --> 18:36.090
What?!

18:36.090 --> 18:37.820
You know who the Little Giant is?

18:37.820 --> 18:38.660
Huh?

18:39.090 --> 18:41.350
Uh, no. Um...

18:41.350 --> 18:49.350
When there's a Japanese person performing well among all the tall foreigners, aren't they all called that?

18:49.820 --> 18:51.900
Oh, right.

18:51.900 --> 18:53.190
Yeah.

18:53.190 --> 18:55.070
I'm gonna be the Little Giant.

18:55.440 --> 19:00.530
Hey, Little Giant who's not gonna make it to Tokyo at this rate, hurry up and copy this.

19:00.530 --> 19:04.240
<b>Class 1-5</b>

19:02.670 --> 19:04.240
Will you help us study again?

19:04.590 --> 19:07.450
Sure. Teaching you guys helps 
me remember the material too.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.750
Thanks! Thank you, Yachi!

19:07.780 --> 19:10.080
Oh, no, it's nothing...

19:11.920 --> 19:13.750
See you at practice!

19:17.030 --> 19:18.720
What is this?

19:18.720 --> 19:21.590
I feel like I've been left out in direct sunlight for a while.

19:30.980 --> 19:32.190
Yachi!

19:32.530 --> 19:35.730
Stuff you taught me showed up in the English quiz this afternoon!

19:35.730 --> 19:37.400
I got a whole third of them right!

19:38.820 --> 19:40.570
Wahoo!

19:40.570 --> 19:42.320
That's amazing, Hinata Shouyou!

19:41.780 --> 19:44.990
Hinata's so sociable.

19:42.320 --> 19:43.580
I said just Hinata is fine!

19:43.580 --> 19:44.990
That's amazing, Hinata!

19:44.990 --> 19:46.760
They're already buddies.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.580
You'll just be observing today.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.440
You don't have to be nervous.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.370
Wight!

19:52.680 --> 19:53.750
<i>"Wight"?</i>

19:53.750 --> 19:56.800
Oh, and be careful of stray balls flying at you.

19:56.800 --> 19:57.500
Right!

19:58.170 --> 19:59.340
<i>Stray balls flying at me?</i>

19:59.340 --> 20:01.380
<i>Could it be someone's trying to kill me?</i>

20:02.380 --> 20:04.090
Hey, are you okay?

20:08.010 --> 20:10.220
<i>Th-The scary guy from yesterday!</i>

20:10.220 --> 20:11.660
<i>He's gonna kill me!</i>

20:11.660 --> 20:15.480
Um, I'm actually the coach...

20:15.950 --> 20:20.060
<i>Oh my god! I judged someone by their appearance again!</i>

20:20.060 --> 20:21.570
I'm so sorry!

20:23.150 --> 20:24.680
Left!

20:26.410 --> 20:27.910
All right!

20:27.910 --> 20:29.080
Nice, Tanaka!

20:29.580 --> 20:30.870
Close the gaps in your block!

20:30.870 --> 20:31.410
Yes, sir!

20:31.410 --> 20:32.540
Next!

20:33.410 --> 20:34.120
I'm sorry!

20:34.120 --> 20:35.830
I can't hear you guys!

20:34.730 --> 20:35.830
Left!

20:35.830 --> 20:37.070
Two blockers!

20:42.430 --> 20:43.530
Nice job, Hinata!

20:43.530 --> 20:45.010
Sorry!

20:45.010 --> 20:46.140
Are you okay?

20:46.820 --> 20:47.940
Uh, yes.

20:47.940 --> 20:51.480
This is my first time seeing volleyball up and close outside of PE class.

20:51.480 --> 20:53.230
It's pretty amazing.

20:53.230 --> 20:56.980
I think our team's offense is among the best in the prefecture.

20:55.670 --> 20:56.980
Sorry!

20:58.990 --> 21:02.780
Kiyoko's talking! She's smiling! Her lips are moving!

21:02.780 --> 21:05.750
So that's what two girls talking looks like.

21:05.750 --> 21:08.790
Stop goofing off, damn it!

21:10.330 --> 21:12.090
Come on, next round!

21:10.330 --> 21:14.330
Karasuno was actually good enough to go to nationals before.

21:12.090 --> 21:14.330
Yes, sir...

21:14.330 --> 21:15.250
Nationals?

21:15.540 --> 21:20.190
But in the last few years, people have called us "the fallen champs" or "the clipped crows."

21:26.550 --> 21:28.050
This time, we're going to appear

21:28.620 --> 21:29.900
on the national stage.

21:31.740 --> 21:32.930
That's amazing...

21:34.140 --> 21:35.460
So amazing!

21:35.460 --> 21:37.310
Totally different from me.

21:38.690 --> 21:39.820
Gather 'round!

21:40.820 --> 21:43.530
So, this is rather sudden,

21:43.530 --> 21:48.620
but Ougi West High School requested a
 practice match tomorrow, and I accepted.

21:49.060 --> 21:51.990
They saw us at the interhigh prelims and insisted.

21:53.790 --> 21:57.080
Don't forget the regret and bitterness of losing to Seijou.

21:57.860 --> 21:58.540
However,

21:59.080 --> 22:01.340
you don't need to hold onto the feeling of losing.

22:01.340 --> 22:03.000
Hurry up and wipe that away!

22:03.000 --> 22:05.470
Yeah!

22:05.470 --> 22:07.480
Is Ougi West good?

22:07.480 --> 22:09.470
It doesn't matter who we're facing.

22:08.610 --> 22:10.680
All right. Let's do this!

22:14.980 --> 22:14.980
{ED}

22:27.950 --> 22:33.520
We climb the mountain in our way

22:34.040 --> 22:40.080
Losing more than just time in the process

22:40.080 --> 22:46.090
Tasting freedom makes us want to fly

22:46.220 --> 22:52.160
And notice the feelings welling up inside

22:52.430 --> 22:55.560
It's almost in our reach

22:55.560 --> 22:58.640
The closer we get, the more it shines

22:58.640 --> 23:01.440
And stretches out in front of our eyes

23:01.440 --> 23:04.810
That panorama created just for us

23:04.810 --> 23:11.070
Until I reach the top and come back down, my lungs will keep breathing

23:11.070 --> 23:17.330
But now I've been possessed by the desire to climb that summit once again

23:17.330 --> 23:23.190
We cast aside all our doubt and set flight to the skies

23:23.190 --> 23:30.340
Our flailing hands reach out and grab hold of the moment

23:31.710 --> 23:33.350
That special moment

23:34.820 --> 23:39.330
Come to us climbers

23:39.880 --> 23:42.070
Come to us right now

23:45.070 --> 23:45.070
{Preview}

23:45.770 --> 23:48.800
<i>Every since that new girl came, 
Kiyoko seems to have a different air about her.</i>

23:48.800 --> 23:50.880
<i>Yeah! It must've been hard to talk, surrounded by all us guys!</i>

23:50.880 --> 23:54.280
<i>From now on, we need to work on our feminine side, Noyacchi!</i>

23:54.280 --> 23:55.280
<i>You got it, Ryuu-Ryuu!</i>

23:55.280 --> 23:56.950
<i>If you talk like that, I'm never speaking to you.</i>

23:55.580 --> 24:00.080
Episode Three: 
"Townsperson B"
