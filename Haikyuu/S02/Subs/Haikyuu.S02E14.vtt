00:02.680 --> 00:04.940
Akiteru, how long can you stay?

00:05.670 --> 00:10.020
I have work starting on the 14th, 
so I'm heading back to Sendai the day after tomorrow.

00:10.020 --> 00:12.690
You didn't want to go to Kei's match?

00:12.690 --> 00:16.920
He looked pretty annoyed with me when I said that I might go.

00:18.620 --> 00:19.850
Oh, yeah.

00:19.850 --> 00:22.430
Mom, there's something I wanted to ask you about Kei's glasses...

00:22.430 --> 00:23.380
I'm home.

00:25.270 --> 00:26.440
Welcome home.

00:26.440 --> 00:27.790
How was the match?

00:27.790 --> 00:29.560
Okay, I guess. We won.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.130
Nice. What were your opponents like?

00:31.460 --> 00:32.770
Two meters.

00:32.770 --> 00:33.600
Huh?

00:33.600 --> 00:36.040
They had a first-year that was 201 cm tall.

00:36.040 --> 00:38.800
Two hundred... And you won?

00:38.800 --> 00:42.120
I guess he just recently started 
playing volleyball or something.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.600
Seriously?

00:44.090 --> 00:47.530
My blocks were completely useless against him, though.

00:48.180 --> 00:49.180
I see...

00:51.360 --> 00:52.110
What?

00:52.110 --> 00:55.280
You only think that's obvious when you lose, don't you?

00:55.610 --> 00:57.580
Huh? Yeah.

00:57.580 --> 00:59.160
I mean, he was two meters tall.

01:01.330 --> 01:05.960
Why don't you come join my team's practice?

01:07.880 --> 01:07.880
{OP}

01:08.340 --> 01:11.340
Leap and fly! High!

01:11.340 --> 01:14.380
Flecked with blood, sweat, and tears

01:14.380 --> 01:18.600
Those glistening wings can let you leave it all behind

01:18.600 --> 01:21.760
So just fly

01:40.030 --> 01:45.160
As the ones who've just found their wings laugh derisively

01:45.160 --> 01:49.290
They just want to see the ends of the ocean

01:49.710 --> 01:54.300
Empty your mind

01:54.300 --> 01:59.890
Let the headwinds guide your approach

01:59.890 --> 02:02.010
And with a hop, step, and a jump

02:02.890 --> 02:06.020
Leap and fly! High!

02:06.020 --> 02:10.710
Let your wings, glistening with blood, sweat, and tears

02:10.710 --> 02:13.320
Take you to wherever you need to go

02:13.320 --> 02:16.110
Unleash your unrefined impulses

02:16.110 --> 02:19.110
Uncover your instincts and bare your uncut fangs

02:19.110 --> 02:20.990
It may take an arduous path

02:20.990 --> 02:23.200
But be torn down it endlessly to achieve your dream

02:23.200 --> 02:26.200
So just fly

02:28.410 --> 02:31.380
Fly high

02:31.380 --> 02:34.500

Growing Fast

02:39.560 --> 02:41.930
All right, start your personal practice now!

02:43.160 --> 02:47.290
We now have less than two months
 until the qualifier at the end of October.

02:47.290 --> 02:50.020
Work hard on improving individually.

02:50.020 --> 02:50.940
Yay!

02:56.030 --> 02:56.820
Kaâ€”

02:57.870 --> 03:00.820
Kageyama? What are you doing?

03:00.820 --> 03:02.320
You could tell it was me?

03:02.320 --> 03:03.160
Yeah...

03:03.160 --> 03:04.240
Damn it!

03:04.240 --> 03:07.500
W-Was that supposed to be a disguise?

03:09.370 --> 03:12.040
Um, uh...

03:12.960 --> 03:16.630
There's a team that we might face during the qualifiers,

03:16.630 --> 03:19.100
so I wanted to check them out no matter what.

03:19.550 --> 03:22.480
I see! You're going to record a video of them!

03:22.480 --> 03:27.060
No. There's an unwritten rule that 
you can only record official matches.

03:27.730 --> 03:30.980
So it's not like anything will 
happen just because I go watch.

03:30.980 --> 03:34.480
But there's less than two months till the qualifiers since summer break is over...

03:35.230 --> 03:37.900
I feel like I should definitely check them out.

03:38.540 --> 03:39.190
Um...

03:40.030 --> 03:47.350
If you don't want to stand out at a school after hours, I think it's best to just wear plain training gear.

03:47.350 --> 03:48.120

I go to this school...

I go to this school...

04:09.100 --> 04:12.440
<i>Act natural... Natural...</i>

04:15.230 --> 04:18.480
Okay, we're about to start.

04:18.480 --> 04:20.360
We're gonna be swapping members next.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.360
Right!

04:32.540 --> 04:35.580
Nice serve, Yamaguchi! It's looking good!

04:33.210 --> 04:36.750
Do you think you could stop Ushiwaka?

04:38.710 --> 04:40.310
Of course not.

04:40.310 --> 04:44.280
He's one of the best three aces in the country, 
so I only could by pure luck.

04:44.280 --> 04:47.680
We can't beat Shiratorizawa if no one can stop him!

04:48.050 --> 04:50.040
That's <i>our</i> jobs as middle blockers!

04:50.040 --> 04:52.640
You're already worried about
 the best team in the prefecture?

04:52.640 --> 04:54.230
Someone's confident.

04:55.230 --> 04:56.480
One way or the other,

04:57.120 --> 04:59.900
we have to beat everyone, so it still matters.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.020
You piss me off.

05:03.020 --> 05:04.150
Why?!

05:04.450 --> 05:05.860
If you can't do it,

05:07.320 --> 05:08.620
I'll have to do it myself!

05:09.330 --> 05:11.370
Saying you'll do it is one thing,

05:12.700 --> 05:16.290
but it really pisses me off when a person 
goes around telling other people they can't.

05:16.290 --> 05:17.020
Huh?

05:17.020 --> 05:18.540
Especially when that "person" is you.

05:20.750 --> 05:22.590
You pushed my diarrhea pressure point!

05:22.590 --> 05:24.130
Damn you, Tsukishima!

05:24.130 --> 05:24.720
I'm leaving.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.720
Hello? It's me.

05:30.660 --> 05:31.760
I'm heading over.

05:37.650 --> 05:38.440
Ow!

05:38.440 --> 05:39.520
Sorry!

05:41.520 --> 05:42.780
He lives!

05:42.780 --> 05:44.110
How was it?

05:44.980 --> 05:45.950
I...

05:48.060 --> 05:50.870
I may never be able to defeat Oikawa.

05:51.660 --> 05:53.790
What are you talking about? Stop joking around!

05:53.790 --> 05:54.910
Did something happen?!

05:56.470 --> 06:01.250
I think Seijou was playing a practice match 
against a college that some of their alumni attend.

06:02.500 --> 06:05.590
When I got there, they were on a break,

06:05.590 --> 06:08.970
and during that break, a different type of match with swapped team members started up.

06:08.970 --> 06:12.220
I'm Oikawa. I look forward to playing with you!

06:13.020 --> 06:17.140
Oikawa joined the college team as their setter.

06:18.310 --> 06:20.610
It didn't look like he knew any of them.

06:21.980 --> 06:24.190
That's Seijou's captain, right?

06:24.190 --> 06:26.320
He's pretty gaudy.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.110
However,

06:27.570 --> 06:29.140
after just a few plays,

06:31.120 --> 06:33.910
Oikawa had completely blended into the team.

06:34.910 --> 06:38.330
Even I could tell how lively the spikers felt.

06:39.210 --> 06:43.370
The way he can draw out 100% of anyone's potential...

06:43.920 --> 06:47.300
There's no guarantee that'll happen even if you dedicate tons of time.

06:48.260 --> 06:55.190
Yet he can do it even if the spiker 
hates him or they have weird habits.

06:55.190 --> 06:55.810
I'm sure

06:57.350 --> 06:58.940
he could command them at will.

07:01.310 --> 07:06.570
<i>No matter where he is, Oikawa is a setter that can bring out the absolute best in his team.</i>

07:10.510 --> 07:15.160
So you're saying that the Great King freaked you out again?

07:15.910 --> 07:18.470
Yeah, I'm really freaked out.

07:22.120 --> 07:27.460
Seijou is the team they are now because 
they've had Oikawa for the last three years,

07:27.800 --> 07:30.680
and spring nationals is our one and only chance to go up against them.

07:31.560 --> 07:34.350
We're gonna beat them together, as a team.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.300
Defeat the Great King!

07:40.300 --> 07:41.940
That's <i>my</i> line, dumbass!

07:42.230 --> 07:44.190
Achoo!

07:45.060 --> 07:46.690
I just got the chills...

07:46.690 --> 07:48.900
If you catch a cold, I'm gonna punch you!

07:48.900 --> 07:50.650
Have you no mercy?!

07:54.070 --> 07:54.870
Two blockers!

07:56.330 --> 07:57.260
All right!

07:57.260 --> 07:59.830
<i>Adults really are stronger.</i>

07:59.830 --> 08:02.400
What the hell? You're such a twig!

08:02.400 --> 08:03.960
You eating properly?

08:04.330 --> 08:06.430
<i>Can I go home now?</i>

08:06.430 --> 08:09.670
Come on, Akaizawa. Give it some time.

08:10.010 --> 08:13.930
My little brother will completely shut you down sooner or later.

08:14.390 --> 08:18.430
There's no way I'd ever lose to 
such a wimpy little high schooler!

08:21.890 --> 08:25.190
He loves riling people up. Don't hold it against him.

08:26.650 --> 08:29.900
<i>Do you think you could stop Ushiwaka?</i>

09:44.560 --> 09:46.690
So, who's this "Mad Dog" guy?

09:46.690 --> 09:48.900
A second-year named Kyoutani Kentarou.

09:49.350 --> 09:52.610
"Mad Dog" is a nickname that Oikawa came up with.

09:53.190 --> 09:55.750
He was pretty famous back in junior high, right?

09:55.750 --> 09:58.820
Oh, yeah. I remember.

09:59.210 --> 10:02.410
South Third Junior High was 
really good for just that one year.

10:02.790 --> 10:09.500
Izumitate                South Third

10:02.790 --> 10:09.500
Izumitate                South Third

10:03.120 --> 10:05.840
He refuses to cooperate even a little,

10:05.840 --> 10:08.960
but his actual skill is miles better than anyone else in our grade.

10:09.850 --> 10:13.800
Right after joining the team,
 he had a chance to play in a practice match,

10:14.470 --> 10:17.470
but he immediately started duking it out with the third-years.

10:17.920 --> 10:20.930
The problem was more how he said it than what he said.

10:21.610 --> 10:24.390
The set is too far from the net, so it's hard to hit it!

10:24.770 --> 10:27.770
You could've dug it out after the block! You suck!

10:27.770 --> 10:30.940
His attitude toward the third-years didn't change,

10:31.730 --> 10:33.730
and he eventually stopped showing up.

10:34.360 --> 10:35.530
What the hell?

10:35.530 --> 10:37.190
There are still third-years around?

10:37.490 --> 10:41.570
I figured they'd be gone by now
 after losing in the interhigh prelims.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.590
You're as amusing as ever, Mad Dog.

10:48.590 --> 10:51.210
I wish you'd stop calling me by that weird nickname.

10:52.110 --> 10:57.460
"Ah, I'm so happy I got to play on the team while Oikawa was still here."

10:58.630 --> 11:01.640
That's how I'll make you feel.

11:05.260 --> 11:08.020
<i>Is he instinctively being wary of Oikawa?</i>

11:12.860 --> 11:16.780
So, with the prefectural qualifier in October,

11:17.190 --> 11:22.240
counting this trip, we'll only be able to go to
 Kanto for practices matches two more times.

11:22.700 --> 11:25.810
Let's make the best of this opportunity.

11:25.810 --> 11:26.830
Yes, sir!

11:30.660 --> 11:32.630
Hey, Tsukki!

11:32.630 --> 11:36.840

11:36.840 --> 11:39.270
Hey!

11:39.270 --> 11:42.800
This episode is titled, "Bokuto Is Rejected by First-Years From Another School."

11:45.570 --> 11:47.680
Okay. Thanks for working with me.

11:47.970 --> 11:49.270
What?!

11:50.020 --> 11:53.190
Why are you so surprised when you're the one who asked him?

11:54.190 --> 11:56.080
Is there a way to stop an opponent's spike

11:57.310 --> 12:03.240
when they're taller or stronger than you?

12:11.000 --> 12:14.420
What do you think is most important when blocking?

12:14.420 --> 12:15.670
Height?

12:16.420 --> 12:17.630
It's timing.

12:18.250 --> 12:22.660
To put it simply, if they can get their hands above the net,

12:22.660 --> 12:25.640
even a grade schooler could stop one of Tanaka's spikes.

12:25.640 --> 12:26.840
What?!

12:26.840 --> 12:29.600
Provided their timing is perfect, that is.

12:29.970 --> 12:34.730
Of course, how your hands are positioned and where the ball is traveling matter too.

12:35.400 --> 12:39.570
However, even though I can explain it, 
I'm not actually good enough to show you.

12:40.200 --> 12:45.320
Someone nearby with the ability to do it and who can direct their team's blocks

12:45.850 --> 12:48.780
would have to be Kuroo from Nekoma.

12:49.410 --> 12:50.740
Lev!

12:51.620 --> 12:52.960
<i>Timing...</i>

12:53.830 --> 12:58.420
<i>The moment that the opponent swings their arm down,
 the block must be reaching its peak.</i>

13:03.380 --> 13:05.390
I-It'll get through next time!

13:05.390 --> 13:06.550
Hey, Tsukki!

13:06.550 --> 13:08.790
How long are you gonna sit on the sidelines?

13:08.790 --> 13:10.140

Nothing's going to fix that except more practice.

13:30.910 --> 13:34.420

13:34.420 --> 13:36.120
The ball's going right between them!

13:36.620 --> 13:39.570

15:47.480 --> 15:53.640
You're fun to play against,

Come time for the match, Shorty here is a royal pain,

20:06.600 --> 20:08.790

It's Karasuno's number ten!

20:56.290 --> 20:59.580
Is he trying to pick a fight with Seijou and Shiratorizawa?

20:59.580 --> 21:00.860
Holy crap!

21:01.440 --> 21:03.540

When I was just a nobody, something lit up my eyes

22:31.490 --> 22:37.290
I was merely a guy languishing complacently in the dark, happy with what I had

Now that we're deliberating at a crossroads, paths blurring together

As I'm waiting for the dawn to reach my eyes with a familiar light

23:28.840 --> 23:35.760
I'm reminded of days I won't return to, and seeking proof of newfound existence
