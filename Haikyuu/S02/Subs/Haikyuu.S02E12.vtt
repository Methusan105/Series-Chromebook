Program

00:09.640 --> 00:11.150
Can I get a copy?

00:11.150 --> 00:11.780
Yes.

00:11.780 --> 00:21.330
Go, go, Teba First! Push it, push it, Teba First!

00:16.720 --> 00:17.620
Let's go!

00:18.460 --> 00:20.500
That's them. You know, Karasuno.

00:20.500 --> 00:21.330
Karasuno?

00:22.040 --> 00:28.240
They're the ones who went to the third set against 
Aoba Jousai at the interhigh prelims and narrowly lost.

00:28.240 --> 00:30.050
Whoa, seriously?

00:30.350 --> 00:34.200
Apparently, Kitagawa First's 
"King of the Court" is on that team.

00:31.700 --> 00:33.820
How many matches in will the ref show up?

00:34.200 --> 00:36.880
I hear they also have Nishinoya from Chidoriyama Junior High.

00:34.560 --> 00:37.710
Maybe next? Since we have a bye for the first round.

00:36.880 --> 00:39.010
The guy people called the best libero back in junior high?

00:39.010 --> 00:45.860
Yeah. I think there was someone other than their
 libero who kept receiving Oikawa's serves, though.

00:45.860 --> 00:47.230
Their captain, I believe it was.

00:47.740 --> 00:51.370
But Karasuno doesn't give me the
 impression that they're particularly tall.

00:51.370 --> 00:54.020
I think there was a guy close to 190 cm on the team.

00:54.020 --> 00:57.820
Though back in the interhigh prelims, he didn't really stand out.

00:57.820 --> 01:01.330
Also, their two left wing spikers are scary.

01:01.330 --> 01:03.350
They really look like power spikers.

01:03.350 --> 01:05.080
And more than anything else...

01:06.020 --> 01:07.210
their manager's cute!

01:06.350 --> 01:09.340
I'm sorry that you have to cheer from up here, Hitoka.

01:07.210 --> 01:09.340
More like beautiful! Or rather, sexy!

01:10.750 --> 01:12.420
And, of course, you know...

01:12.740 --> 01:16.240
There's the tiny middle blocker who can hit those ridiculous fast attacks.

01:17.170 --> 01:18.760
Karasuno's number ten!

01:20.160 --> 01:22.850
Whoa, what the heck?! 
He looks like he's all skin and bones!

01:23.760 --> 01:25.700
H-Hinata, are you okay?

01:25.700 --> 01:27.640
Yep, I'm fine.

01:27.640 --> 01:30.630
I puked on the way here, so I feel a bit better.

01:30.630 --> 01:33.900
Not a surprise you puked after eating all those pork bowls for breakfast.

01:33.900 --> 01:36.760
It's normal to eat pork cutlets on the day of a match!

01:36.760 --> 01:38.380
I don't see how that's normal...

01:38.380 --> 01:40.700
You moron! Hinata, you're such a moron!

01:40.990 --> 01:44.520
Kageyama's list of insults only has one entry.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.180
I-I'll do my best to add more entries!

01:46.240 --> 01:48.010
I have that one thing you can drink!

01:47.180 --> 01:50.960
Th-Thinking back on Hinata puking makes me want to puke myself...

01:48.010 --> 01:49.910
Oh, thanks!

01:50.960 --> 01:51.420
Huh?

01:51.420 --> 01:53.250
Hurry up and go to the bathroom!

01:53.250 --> 01:56.250
M-Me too, especially with all the anxiety...

01:56.960 --> 01:59.930
I thought you were concentrating, 
but all you were doing is holding back your puke?!

02:00.430 --> 02:03.870
Shouyou, is this seriously the second time you threw up on the bus?

02:03.870 --> 02:08.230
You were able to actually hold it in until the bus stopped, instead of puking on someone's crotch.

02:08.230 --> 02:10.150
You've really grown up, Hinata.

02:11.790 --> 02:16.420
Are they really the team that had Seijou on the ropes?

02:14.020 --> 02:15.500
Shouyou!

<i>Karasuno's fight to make it to spring nationals...</i>

06:11.050 --> 06:12.840
Let's have a good match!

06:12.840 --> 06:13.810
<i>...begins here!</i>

06:13.810 --> 06:16.450
Go, go, let's go! Let's go, Kaji High!

06:15.300 --> 06:15.980
Listen up.

06:16.450 --> 06:21.060
All of their third-years are already gone, 
but their power has always been with their second-years.

06:21.060 --> 06:24.290
They won their first-round match in straight sets as well.

06:24.290 --> 06:25.470
Don't let your guard down!

06:25.470 --> 06:27.500
Be especially careful of their left wing spiker, number one.

06:27.500 --> 06:28.450
Yessir!

06:29.130 --> 06:31.840
Since the end of the interhigh prelims until now,

06:31.840 --> 06:34.410
you've taken on unfamiliar challenges and haven't been in sync.

06:34.960 --> 06:39.080
On top of that, you've lost about 70 practice matches against the powerhouse schools from Kanto.

06:40.480 --> 06:45.840
But the new weapons which were useless at first are now starting to take shape.

06:46.480 --> 06:50.800
Please get a win that makes up for all of the frustration you've felt so far.

06:51.120 --> 06:52.800
Yessir!

06:51.120 --> 06:52.800
All right!

06:52.800 --> 06:54.810
Karasuno, fight!

06:54.810 --> 06:55.770
Yeah...

06:54.810 --> 06:55.770
Yeah!

06:55.770 --> 06:57.640
Oh? So you came to watch the match too,

06:57.640 --> 06:59.350
Coach Ukai?

06:59.350 --> 07:00.480
Yeah.

07:00.480 --> 07:02.660
I guess that <i>is</i> your precious grandson's team.

07:02.660 --> 07:04.070
That's got nothing to do with it!

07:04.070 --> 07:05.900
Ukai? Grandson?

07:05.900 --> 07:07.900
You're from Karasuno too, right?

07:07.900 --> 07:09.570
Why are you up here?

07:09.570 --> 07:12.890
O-Only one manager can be on the bench!

07:12.890 --> 07:14.080
You didn't know that?

07:14.080 --> 07:14.950
Oh.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.290
Ah, there's Shou!

07:15.360 --> 07:18.350
I actually just saw them play the other day.

07:17.290 --> 07:18.350
You're right!

07:18.350 --> 07:20.870
They have this intense first-year duo.

07:18.350 --> 07:21.710
Shou? Oh, you mean Hinata.

07:20.870 --> 07:23.850
Karasuno might go pretty far this year.

07:23.850 --> 07:28.550
There's no match that you can't win, 
and there's no match that's a sure thing.

07:28.920 --> 07:33.260
The slightest difference in condition, anxiety, or impatience matters.

07:33.260 --> 07:36.490
Even for a powerhouse school, the players are humans.

07:36.490 --> 07:40.690
The smallest disturbance can turn a match ever so easily.

07:42.220 --> 07:45.400
Now then, which way will it go for Karasuno today?

07:45.820 --> 07:47.450
Give us a good serve, Asahi!

08:01.910 --> 08:03.540
All right!

08:03.830 --> 08:05.960
Yay! That was awesome!

08:04.710 --> 08:06.800
They started with a service ace!

08:06.800 --> 08:08.250
Not bad.

08:08.610 --> 08:10.010
All right...

08:11.340 --> 08:12.300
Let's go!

08:18.220 --> 08:20.180
Ougi South                     Karasuno

08:18.220 --> 08:20.180
Ougi South                     Karasuno

08:24.660 --> 08:26.400
<i>He switched to a tip.</i>

08:29.320 --> 08:30.570
Nice, Daichi!

08:29.320 --> 08:31.860
S-So fast! It's like he was waiting for it!

08:32.400 --> 08:35.790
<i>I feel like I can see the spiker's movements better than before.</i>

08:35.790 --> 08:36.740
Asahi!

08:38.980 --> 08:44.170
<i>Ever since the first round, Ougi South hasn't been 
doing fast attacks any time the receives were a bit off.</i>

08:44.500 --> 08:45.140
<i>Left.</i>

08:45.140 --> 08:45.830
Tazawa!

08:49.880 --> 08:52.340
All right!

08:52.630 --> 08:54.400
Nice block, Tsukishima!

08:52.920 --> 08:54.400
How do I put this...

08:54.400 --> 08:58.180
Everyone seems to be more sure of their movements than previously.

08:58.180 --> 09:02.680
It's not like they only practiced their new stuff during the training camp.

09:03.160 --> 09:06.600
They had tons of practice against powerhouse schools that were all totally different.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.140
All right!

09:05.560 --> 09:06.600
Nice receive!

09:07.190 --> 09:12.340
The power behind their serves and spikes,
 the diversity in their attacks, their defense...

09:12.340 --> 09:15.570
They're far more used to facing all of that stuff at a high level

09:16.790 --> 09:18.070
than before.

09:18.740 --> 09:20.700
All right!

09:19.740 --> 09:20.700
Damn it.

09:27.490 --> 09:28.710
All right!

09:29.060 --> 09:30.420
Nice, Kageyama!

09:29.060 --> 09:30.880
Another service ace!

09:30.420 --> 09:31.460
Thanks!

09:30.880 --> 09:33.160
Now they're on set point.

09:31.460 --> 09:34.670
Ougi South                          Karasuno

09:31.460 --> 09:34.670
Ougi South                          Karasuno

09:35.450 --> 09:38.930
I can't believe we ended up facing such a good team early on again.

09:42.680 --> 09:44.730
Shiratorizawa!

09:48.770 --> 09:50.980
Ushijima! Ushijima!

09:48.770 --> 09:50.980
Shiratorizawa          Ougi South

09:48.770 --> 09:50.980
Shiratorizawa          Ougi South

09:51.690 --> 09:56.200
Ushijima! Ushijima!

09:56.200 --> 09:59.070
Come on! We still have a chance!

09:59.820 --> 10:00.880
Let's get pumped up!

10:00.880 --> 10:02.500
Where's your usual enthusiasm?!

10:04.330 --> 10:05.920
Yeah, that right there! Bring that enthusiasm!

10:04.660 --> 10:10.000
<i>The captain's voice was all raspy because he 
was trying to talk over Shiratorizawa's cheers.</i>

10:05.920 --> 10:07.750
Let's get a point!

10:13.690 --> 10:15.090
It's up! Towada!

10:17.650 --> 10:19.890
<i>Even if I went for the ball, I wouldn't make it.</i>

10:19.890 --> 10:23.140
<i>Even if I did make it, we wouldn't necessarily score.</i>

10:24.000 --> 10:27.520
<i>And even if we did score, it's a single, measly point.</i>

10:28.170 --> 10:31.360
<i>There's no point going after something so...</i>

10:45.240 --> 10:47.200
Ougi South High School

10:47.870 --> 10:50.360
Hey, don't look so glum!

10:50.360 --> 10:51.920
It makes you look scarier.

10:52.750 --> 10:58.710
You guys were a real pain, but if you weren't around,
 we wouldn't even have been able to enter the tournament.

10:58.710 --> 11:00.130
So thanks.

11:00.860 --> 11:04.270
You guys are naturals at volleyball and 
have the right physique, so don't give up!

11:33.130 --> 11:34.260
He did it!

11:34.260 --> 11:36.380
Shou's amazing! He jumped sideways!

11:37.410 --> 11:39.090
Damn, he's good...

11:40.010 --> 11:42.590
I'm gonna beat everyone and go to Tokyo.

11:43.550 --> 11:45.930
<i>He wasn't just trying to sound tough.</i>

11:45.930 --> 11:48.060
<i>That's really his intention.</i>

11:48.640 --> 11:52.480
<i>Even though he's so short, 
he intends on defeating Ushiwaka.</i>

11:48.640 --> 11:52.480
All right!

11:56.290 --> 11:57.750
L-Let's keep at it!

11:58.190 --> 12:00.220
Winning or losing isn't important.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.950
What <i>is</i> important is that you guys do your best.

12:05.510 --> 12:07.910
Hey! Punks! Don't just stand there silently!

12:09.160 --> 12:11.370
C-Captain Akki!

12:12.330 --> 12:16.770
Why is it that you guys can pick fights 
but chicken out when it comes to volleyball?

12:16.770 --> 12:18.340
Ch-Chicken out?!

12:19.840 --> 12:24.800
N-No matter how hard you glare at me, 
I'm up here on the second floor, so I'm not afraid of you!

12:24.800 --> 12:27.300
Why did he even come?

12:27.970 --> 12:30.240
When the opponent pushes back just a bit, you give up.

12:30.860 --> 12:32.560
That's what I mean by chickening out.

12:33.520 --> 12:37.110
This is your fight, so what you do is up to you.

12:37.110 --> 12:39.400
But I'll give you one piece of advice.

12:39.900 --> 12:43.370
Being serious, giving your all, and doing your best...

12:43.370 --> 12:44.740
isn't lame at all!

12:52.220 --> 12:53.720
What the? You're scaring me.

12:53.720 --> 12:55.870
Has he gone insane?

12:56.170 --> 12:57.090
Coach!

12:57.090 --> 12:58.070
Yes?

12:58.070 --> 13:02.320
You know, since we came here to fight
 each other on opposite sides of the net,

13:02.320 --> 13:05.470
our only choice is to win and advance in the tournament.

13:07.310 --> 13:13.930
Trying to act tough and worrying more about how we look is pretty lame.

13:13.930 --> 13:15.230
Towada...

13:15.230 --> 13:16.460
All right, I'm gonna say it.

13:16.460 --> 13:17.310
Say what?

13:20.730 --> 13:25.740
We're gonna beat Karasuno, make it through the prelims, 
and defeat Shiratorizawa!

13:27.340 --> 13:28.030
All right!

13:28.950 --> 13:30.740
Wow, you actually said it!

13:30.740 --> 13:32.490
Well said, Mr. Big Mouth!

13:32.490 --> 13:34.790
We're gonna defeat Shiratorizawa, huh?

13:34.790 --> 13:36.620
Bring it on, then!

13:37.500 --> 13:39.590
We're seriously gonna win, guys!

13:39.880 --> 13:41.130
Yeah!

13:42.210 --> 13:44.550

14:06.490 --> 14:08.530
Karasuno                 Ougi South

14:08.820 --> 14:10.200
Yay!

14:08.820 --> 14:10.200
Nice, Hinata!

14:10.200 --> 14:11.410
He did it again!

14:11.410 --> 14:13.620
That first-year duo is really something.

14:13.620 --> 14:14.290
Yeah.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.170
But the upperclassmen also exceeded my expectations.

14:19.460 --> 14:22.340
The reason Karasuno is on the brink of revival

14:22.340 --> 14:26.050
is in large part thanks to their passionate advisor and newfound strength.

14:27.170 --> 14:31.550
But that's only possible because they have a sturdy foundation.

14:31.550 --> 14:32.600
A sturdy foundation?

14:33.470 --> 14:38.640
I oversaw practice at Karasuno for a short period of time last year.

14:38.640 --> 14:42.770
Back then, they had the skill and the guts.

14:43.480 --> 14:46.780
But for some reason, I felt a lack of confidence.

14:47.110 --> 14:51.030
It was like they were subconsciously accustomed to losing.

14:51.700 --> 14:53.980
They don't look like that now.

14:53.980 --> 14:57.540
When the current third-years came,

14:58.500 --> 15:03.500
Karasuno being a powerhouse school 
was starting to become a thing of the past.

15:04.380 --> 15:07.530
Their expectations must've been shattered.

15:07.530 --> 15:10.840
They were here for the most disappointing time in the school's history.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.390
And that's exactly why...

15:16.300 --> 15:21.310
those who survived have such a sturdy foundation.

15:22.270 --> 15:24.020
Daichi, nice receive!

15:27.990 --> 15:29.950
All right!

15:28.280 --> 15:29.950
Wow! They're so amazing!

15:29.950 --> 15:32.410
Karasuno             Ougi South

15:29.950 --> 15:32.410
Karasuno             Ougi South

15:30.230 --> 15:32.410
Whoa. They're ahead by ten points.

15:32.780 --> 15:34.240
All right, let's keep this up!

15:32.780 --> 15:34.240
<i>Damn, they're really good.</i>

15:34.240 --> 15:34.960
Yeah!

15:34.960 --> 15:37.200
We still have a chance! Don't give up!

15:38.370 --> 15:40.340
Give us one more, Kageyama!

15:46.090 --> 15:47.710
All right!

15:47.710 --> 15:49.800
Kageyama's serves are sharp as hell.

15:49.800 --> 15:50.670
Yeah.

15:50.670 --> 15:52.930
Karasuno           Ougi South

15:50.670 --> 15:52.930
Karasuno           Ougi South

15:51.240 --> 15:52.930
And now we're at match point.

15:54.850 --> 15:59.890
<i>Every time, after we're in a do-or-die situation, we regret the lack of practice.</i>

15:59.890 --> 16:02.270
Give us another good serve, Kageyama!

16:03.650 --> 16:09.680
Karasuno and Ougi South's match is gonna end sooner than I thought, so let's get ready for the next match.

16:09.680 --> 16:10.640
Yeah.

16:10.640 --> 16:13.240
When there's a clear difference in skill,
 the matches don't last long.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.530
It's not over yet! Don't give up!

16:28.210 --> 16:30.050
<i>Will I barely reach?</i>

16:30.550 --> 16:31.800
<i>Or will I not?</i>

16:32.880 --> 16:34.840
<i>Well, we're still second-years,</i>

16:35.720 --> 16:37.970
<i>so we still have another shot.</i>

16:42.520 --> 16:46.480
<i>And that's why you never get any better, damn it!</i>

16:49.820 --> 16:52.530
Keep it in play and send it back over!

16:59.080 --> 17:00.410
Tanaka!

17:02.830 --> 17:04.480
It's not over yet!

17:04.480 --> 17:06.500
Let me finish it!

17:15.130 --> 17:17.090
<i>I definitely underestimated him.</i>

17:18.160 --> 17:21.680
<i>I thought he was an idiot when he said he was going to nationals.</i>

17:24.480 --> 17:25.810
<i>I'm...</i>

17:26.380 --> 17:27.560
<i>the idiot.</i>

17:31.650 --> 17:33.780
Karasuno                   Ougi South

17:31.650 --> 17:33.780
Karasuno                   Ougi South

17:35.990 --> 17:38.700
All right!

17:38.700 --> 17:40.200
Did we win?

17:39.060 --> 17:40.200
All right!

17:40.200 --> 17:41.330
We won!

17:41.330 --> 17:42.410
So cool!

17:42.790 --> 17:43.860
All right!

17:43.860 --> 17:45.370
They made it through their first match.

17:47.580 --> 17:50.790
Karasuno           Ougi South

17:47.580 --> 17:50.790
Karasuno           Ougi South

17:48.210 --> 17:50.170
Thank you very much for the match!

18:04.610 --> 18:07.100
Good job out there. You never gave up!

18:10.600 --> 18:11.500
Yeah.

18:12.820 --> 18:15.400
It's natural to feel regret right now.

18:16.960 --> 18:20.450
No matter what kind of fight it is, 
it's only natural to feel regret when you lose.

18:21.230 --> 18:27.500
I'd go as far as saying even guys who don't practice much probably feel regret when they lose a match.

18:28.290 --> 18:32.000
Regret is something anyone can feel for real.

18:32.670 --> 18:33.380
But...

18:34.620 --> 18:38.430
anyone who forgets how that feels 
after three days will never get better!

18:39.090 --> 18:43.650
Your three years of high school will pass 
you by in an instant if you drag your feet!

18:44.600 --> 18:47.560
Don't you dare forget this feeling!

18:51.980 --> 18:53.400
W-Well, see ya.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.610
I'll come watch again next year, so do your best.

19:01.490 --> 19:02.410
Captain!

19:05.910 --> 19:08.830
Th-Thank you very much.

19:09.500 --> 19:10.750
Thanks!

19:22.760 --> 19:23.910
Number four!

19:23.910 --> 19:25.150
Nice receive!

19:25.150 --> 19:28.680
It's like he messes with my depth perception or something.

19:28.680 --> 19:32.400
I tried standing next to him in the hallway earlier,
 and he was way taller than me!

19:32.400 --> 19:33.560
Of course he was!

19:34.110 --> 19:35.940
The dude's two meters tall!

19:41.360 --> 19:43.490
He's so disgusting!

19:43.490 --> 19:47.190
It's a weapon... His height itself is a weapon...

19:47.190 --> 19:49.330
<i>A banana really fits you, Tanaka.</i>

19:53.250 --> 19:55.250
Nishida              Kakugawa

19:53.250 --> 19:55.250
Nishida              Kakugawa

19:55.710 --> 19:57.720
Thank you for the match!

19:57.720 --> 19:59.510
Looks like our next opponent has been decided.

20:05.460 --> 20:06.930
If we win our next match,

20:06.930 --> 20:10.690
we get past the first round of the prelims and 
advance to the decider tournament in October.

20:11.680 --> 20:13.190
We're definitely gonna advance!

20:13.190 --> 20:14.100
Yeah!

20:14.810 --> 20:18.190
<i>It really is over when you lose once.</i>

20:19.480 --> 20:20.570
<i>And yet...</i>

20:20.990 --> 20:23.240
<i>they're facing someone two meters tall!</i>

20:29.910 --> 20:31.660
Two meters is really tall...

20:32.290 --> 20:35.320
201 cm tall and 162 cm tall, huh?

20:35.320 --> 20:37.880
I'm 163 cm tall if you round up!

20:36.840 --> 20:41.130
201 cm tall and 162 cm tall... There's a 40 cm difference.

20:40.530 --> 20:41.670
Don't ignore me!

20:41.670 --> 20:45.370
F-Forty cm is like the same size as Hello Kattey!

20:45.370 --> 20:47.720
That's not that big!

20:47.720 --> 20:49.140
Is that an attempt to cheer him up?

20:49.140 --> 20:51.800
Peekachu is also 40 cm.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.210
So is the blackbelly lantern.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.100
B-Blackbelly lantern?

20:55.560 --> 20:56.700
What's that?

20:56.700 --> 20:57.690
It's a kind of shark.

20:57.690 --> 20:58.570
Oh...

20:58.570 --> 21:00.280
You're so smart, Tsukki!

21:01.670 --> 21:04.670
I want to combine with a blackbelly lantern.

21:04.670 --> 21:05.740
Come again?

21:05.740 --> 21:09.120
If I combine with a blackbelly lantern, I'll be two meters tall.

21:09.120 --> 21:11.040
Hey, what are you talking about?

21:11.790 --> 21:14.000
Are you actually scared?

21:14.290 --> 21:14.870
Huh?

21:15.620 --> 21:16.500
Let's go!

21:16.960 --> 21:19.390
All right!

21:19.390 --> 21:22.760
H-He really wanted to combine with a blackbelly lantern.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.780
Will he be all right?

21:24.780 --> 21:26.170
Oh, yeah...

21:26.170 --> 21:28.790
I'm sure he'll be fine even if he's like that before a match.

21:28.790 --> 21:30.720
R-Right?!

21:30.720 --> 21:32.640
It's finally time.

21:33.180 --> 21:36.600
They have a real battle on their hands with that really tall guy.

21:37.040 --> 21:40.020
No, they can definitely handle it!

21:40.020 --> 21:41.520
Right, Coach Ukai?

21:41.520 --> 21:43.190
Who can say for sure?

21:43.190 --> 21:43.820
What?!

21:44.530 --> 21:49.280
High school boys are still growing, 
and their playstyle is still growing too.

21:50.030 --> 21:52.800
That's why having a great ace

21:52.800 --> 21:56.500
or someone unconventionally tall can be 
the difference between winning and losing.

21:55.330 --> 21:56.920
Hurry up, Hinata.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.040
That can't be...

21:56.920 --> 21:58.040
R-Right!

21:59.330 --> 22:02.460
Being tall is itself a weapon.

22:03.150 --> 22:06.930
I can't wait to see how...

22:07.240 --> 22:08.340
Let's go!

22:08.340 --> 22:09.640
Yeah!

22:12.220 --> 22:13.720
...Karasuno will deal with it.

22:14.980 --> 22:14.980
{ED}

22:27.950 --> 22:33.520
We climb the mountain in our way

22:34.040 --> 22:40.080
Losing more than just time in the process

22:40.080 --> 22:46.090
Tasting freedom makes us want to fly

22:46.220 --> 22:52.160
And notice the feelings welling up inside

22:52.430 --> 22:55.560
It's almost in our reach

22:55.560 --> 22:58.640
The closer we get, the more it shines

22:58.640 --> 23:01.440
And stretches out in front of our eyes

23:01.440 --> 23:04.810
That panorama created just for us

23:04.810 --> 23:11.070
Until I reach the top and come back down, my lungs will keep breathing

23:11.070 --> 23:17.330
But now I've been possessed by the desire to climb that summit once again

23:17.330 --> 23:23.190
We cast aside all our doubt and set flight to the skies

23:23.190 --> 23:30.350
Our flailing hands reach out and grab hold of the moment

23:31.710 --> 23:33.350
That special moment

23:34.820 --> 23:39.330
Come to us climbers

23:39.880 --> 23:42.070
Come to us right now

23:45.070 --> 23:45.070
{Preview}

23:45.740 --> 23:47.760
<i>So a blackbelly lantern is a type of shark, huh?</i>

23:47.760 --> 23:50.200
<i>There are a lot of fish with confusing names.</i>

23:50.200 --> 23:52.580
<i>For instance, the red bream isn't actually a bream because it's a deep sea fish.</i>

23:52.580 --> 23:54.530
<i>You really know a lot about fish, Tsukki.</i>

23:54.530 --> 23:55.490
<i>Shut up, Yamaguchi.</i>

23:55.490 --> 23:56.620
<i>Sorry, Tsukki!</i>
