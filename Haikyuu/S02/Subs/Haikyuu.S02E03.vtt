00:02.460 --> 00:05.400
Oh, Hitoka. Are you done changing?

00:06.360 --> 00:07.980
I'll walk with you, so hold on a sec.

00:07.980 --> 00:09.150
I'm going to go change too.

00:09.150 --> 00:10.530
No, it's okay.

00:10.530 --> 00:13.570
I'm the one who should be walking you home or something! Or...

00:13.570 --> 00:14.780
Don't worry about it.

00:17.120 --> 00:19.870
What's wrong, Teach? Why the serious face?

00:20.330 --> 00:22.020
Oh, well...

00:22.020 --> 00:29.050
Apparently, the bus we were supposed to take for the away games in Tokyo is being used by another club,

00:29.050 --> 00:31.090
so it doesn't look like we'll get it.

00:31.090 --> 00:35.090
It looks like it's going to cost us a lot more than expected, so I don't know what to do.

00:36.390 --> 00:39.470
I'll try talking to a few more alumni.

00:39.470 --> 00:41.850
I'm sure this problem'll come up again in the future.

00:41.850 --> 00:43.530
I apologize.

00:43.530 --> 00:45.060
I'll try reaching out as well.

00:45.520 --> 00:49.020
Well, if all else fails, I do have some savings.

00:49.020 --> 00:52.360
No, no, no. You need to save that for your future wedding, or something.

00:52.360 --> 00:53.470
And don't do that with your hand!

00:53.470 --> 00:55.610
Yachi!

00:55.610 --> 00:57.840
Are you gonna be our manager?!

00:57.840 --> 00:59.220
Uh, um...

00:59.220 --> 01:00.490
You will, right?

01:00.990 --> 01:03.450
Hey, first-year girl, hey!

01:03.450 --> 01:07.210
We hope that you will join the 
Karasuno High School Volleyball Team.

01:07.210 --> 01:07.880
Huh?

01:08.690 --> 01:11.170
When you're around, Kiyoko talks a lot.

01:11.170 --> 01:13.450
What kinda way to recruit is that, idiots?!

01:13.450 --> 01:15.930
I'm sorry they're all so stupid.

01:15.930 --> 01:17.340
No, not at all!

01:17.800 --> 01:20.020
I'm flattered.

01:21.090 --> 01:25.040
I've never tried to do something on my own,

01:25.040 --> 01:29.020
or had someone need me for anything...

01:29.400 --> 01:32.770
Even in school plays, I've only been an extra.

01:32.770 --> 01:35.290
Like Townsperson B or a tree.

01:35.950 --> 01:36.860
<i>A tree?</i>

01:37.350 --> 01:41.870
So when Shimizu worked so hard to recruit a Townsperson B, like me,

01:41.870 --> 01:46.680
who has no experience or knowledge of volleyball, I was really happy.

01:47.830 --> 01:49.750
But I'm sure I'm not muchâ€”

01:49.750 --> 01:51.670
I totally get how you feel.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.850
Even if Kiyoko said...

01:53.850 --> 01:57.010
I'm going to steal money from you, so follow me.

01:57.010 --> 01:59.090
...I'd still follow her.

01:59.580 --> 02:00.890
You're so manly, Ryuu!

01:59.890 --> 02:02.260
<i>Uh, I think that's a bit different.</i>

02:00.890 --> 02:03.280
Somehow, that sounds awesome!

02:03.280 --> 02:05.600
Looks like Tanaka said something again.

02:05.930 --> 02:08.020
Oh, that reminds me...

02:49.900 --> 02:54.610

02:54.610 --> 02:59.190
But I don't understand it myself

02:59.660 --> 03:04.080

I won't stop trying to find the best version of myself

03:18.180 --> 03:20.260

03:20.260 --> 03:24.200
I'll say no, thank you, and surge on ahead

03:59.120 --> 04:01.300
Okay. See you later, Mom.

04:01.300 --> 04:04.050
Make sure you clean up over here.

04:12.290 --> 04:16.020
I've been invited to be the manager for the boys' volleyball team...

04:16.020 --> 04:17.060
Volleyball?

04:17.700 --> 04:18.480
Yeah...

04:20.070 --> 04:21.820
<i>Oh, I'll be right there. Just a second.</i>

04:21.820 --> 04:22.570
Yes, ma'am.

04:22.920 --> 04:26.990
Didn't Karasuno's volleyball team make it to nationals before?

04:26.990 --> 04:28.410
It's a strong school, right?

04:28.410 --> 04:29.040
Yes.

04:29.700 --> 04:32.370
Apparently, they've gotten pretty good again lately.

04:32.370 --> 04:33.870
The taxi's here.

04:33.870 --> 04:36.250
Do you even know anything about volleyball?

04:36.250 --> 04:38.880
Well, I plan on learning more about it.

04:39.690 --> 04:44.340
You're free to do whatever, but joining passionate people when you aren't going to give it your all

04:44.790 --> 04:46.930
is the rudest thing you could do.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.520
I'm counting on you to make breakfast tomorrow.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.140
Oh, right...

04:55.690 --> 04:59.230
Why did you have to say it like that?

04:59.230 --> 05:00.940
You're so cold-hearted.

05:00.940 --> 05:03.780
I-I didn't mean it like that!

05:03.780 --> 05:08.410
You're probably the reason why Hitoka's unmotivated.

05:08.410 --> 05:12.110
I just want her to be stronger!

05:12.110 --> 05:15.040
Besides, if she quits just because I said something once,

05:15.380 --> 05:19.170
she'll crumble under the weight of trivial things in the future.

05:41.980 --> 05:46.400
I don't think everyone has to already like something before giving it a go.

05:46.820 --> 05:51.870
You don't need an unwavering will
 or noble motives just to get started.

05:51.870 --> 05:57.330
Sometimes things that you start on a whim 
end up becoming very important to you too.

05:59.340 --> 06:04.230
You just need a little curiosity to get started.

06:05.440 --> 06:06.720
Hinata and Tsukishima.

06:06.720 --> 06:07.720
Yes, sir!

06:08.200 --> 06:12.260
Since you two are middle blockers, 
you have to be able to use blocks as your weapon.

06:08.700 --> 06:11.050
The floor's wet. Can you mop it?

06:11.050 --> 06:12.260
Yep.

06:12.260 --> 06:13.390
Where's it wet?

06:13.060 --> 06:16.180
I need you to be so good at blocking that you could stop Ushiwaka.

06:13.390 --> 06:14.350
Right around here.

06:16.180 --> 06:16.770

06:48.240 --> 06:49.090

07:08.030 --> 07:08.900
Yeah.

07:09.350 --> 07:17.830
I was wondering why you can study so hard to play in away games and get so fired up for a practice match.

07:18.130 --> 07:22.040
Huh? Because I want to get better and win, right?

07:22.340 --> 07:23.960
I-I see...

07:24.880 --> 07:27.610
I'm sure you have your reasons.

07:27.610 --> 07:29.470
Huh? Reasons?

07:29.470 --> 07:30.980
Reasons why I wanna win?

07:30.980 --> 07:32.470
Huh? Yeah...

07:33.280 --> 07:35.720
Do you need a reason to not want to lose?

07:37.610 --> 07:38.680
Hey, Kageyama.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.240
Is there some reason you don't want to lose?

07:42.040 --> 07:43.810
Why would there be?

07:43.810 --> 07:46.900
Do you need a reason to eat when you're hungry?

07:46.900 --> 07:48.640
Right?

07:50.060 --> 07:52.820
<i>So this on the same level as hunger?</i>

07:52.820 --> 07:55.660
Sorry. That was an inane question.

07:55.660 --> 07:56.910
"Inane question"?

07:56.910 --> 08:00.580
"A foolish question, or a comment said to 
humble oneself after asking such a question."

08:00.580 --> 08:02.050

08:03.250 --> 08:05.240

08:12.140 --> 08:12.800

08:17.390 --> 08:19.730

<i>You don't need an unwavering will
 or noble motives just to get started.</i>

08:33.410 --> 08:34.860

08:34.860 --> 08:35.900
Oh, right.

08:36.530 --> 08:36.990

09:00.390 --> 09:02.850
"The fallen champs," "the clipped crows."

09:04.140 --> 09:06.980
I don't think those nicknames apply to them anymore.

09:06.980 --> 09:07.690
Huh?

09:07.690 --> 09:11.530
They made it to the third set against Aoba Jousai in the interhigh prelims.

09:11.530 --> 09:14.150
The last set was a deuce deep into the 30's.

09:14.150 --> 09:15.030
Seriously?!

09:15.860 --> 09:22.040
Oh, but they do have Nishinoya from Chidoriyama and Kageyama from Kitagawa First, right?

09:22.330 --> 09:24.250
They do, but...

09:25.260 --> 09:26.000
Coach?

09:27.210 --> 09:33.190
But most important is their number ten. 
He's a first-year with impressive physical ability.

09:33.190 --> 09:36.720
Sometimes, his mere presence changes a match to an astonishing extent.

09:38.790 --> 09:41.600
It appears that Karasuno's transforming.

09:42.060 --> 09:44.770
Thank you for coming so far!

09:45.390 --> 09:47.520
Nice spike!

09:48.940 --> 09:50.060
Nice spike!

09:50.780 --> 09:51.730
Nice spike!

09:50.780 --> 09:53.530
We're gonna start soon, so get changed!

09:53.530 --> 09:54.570
Yessir!

10:01.620 --> 10:02.990
Hinata, that's backward.

10:02.990 --> 10:03.990
Like Jamila.

10:03.990 --> 10:05.700
Sorry. You'll get used to it.

10:06.330 --> 10:09.670
Asahi, that string in your hair is awesome!

10:09.670 --> 10:10.420
String?

10:11.180 --> 10:12.710
It's a hairband.

10:12.710 --> 10:16.170
Though you saying that <i>does</i> give me a bit of confidence.

10:16.170 --> 10:17.220
Straighten up!

10:17.220 --> 10:18.880
Are you trying to change your image, Asahi?

10:18.880 --> 10:20.140
No, the other day...

10:22.970 --> 10:24.350
What is it, Shimizu?

10:24.350 --> 10:27.690
Your hair is braided so tight it 
makes me think you'll go bald.

10:28.770 --> 10:29.940
And that's why I'm wearing it.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.770
I need to be careful too.

10:32.770 --> 10:34.820
There are bald guys who're popular with girls too.

10:34.820 --> 10:36.360
I'm not bald!

10:37.360 --> 10:40.110
Aren't you going to put on your uniform, Tanaka?

10:40.110 --> 10:41.490
I'm about to!

10:41.990 --> 10:43.490
They're like a flock of birds...

10:43.490 --> 10:46.700
A flock? True, they <i>are</i> crows.

10:47.370 --> 10:50.500
But once the match starts, they actually get along great.

10:52.750 --> 10:53.840
Gather 'round!

10:55.340 --> 10:58.840
This is our first match with another team since the interhigh prelims.

10:59.470 --> 11:02.680
You haven't forgotten the frustration of losing from then, have you?

11:02.680 --> 11:03.820
No, sir!

11:04.780 --> 11:06.970
All right, go out there and mess 'em up!

11:06.970 --> 11:07.810
Yessir!

11:08.310 --> 11:10.390
Karasuno, fight!

11:10.390 --> 11:11.520
Yeah!

11:11.520 --> 11:12.650
Here we go!

11:12.650 --> 11:13.980
Yeah!

11:14.310 --> 11:16.280
Have we played this team before?

11:16.280 --> 11:17.860
No, we haven't.

11:25.780 --> 11:27.080
Come on, bring it!

11:26.330 --> 11:28.040
Let's score here!

11:36.550 --> 11:38.210
Yeah!

11:38.210 --> 11:39.510
Good one, Kageyama!

11:38.210 --> 11:43.890
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:38.210 --> 11:43.890
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:39.510 --> 11:40.340
Thanks!

11:40.340 --> 11:41.350
Did they just score?

11:41.350 --> 11:41.930
One more!

11:41.930 --> 11:43.550
Hitoka, the score.

11:43.550 --> 11:45.430
Oh, r-right.

11:43.890 --> 11:43.970
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:43.890 --> 11:43.970
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:43.970 --> 11:44.090
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:43.970 --> 11:44.090
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:44.090 --> 11:44.220
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:44.090 --> 11:44.220
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:44.220 --> 11:44.350
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:44.220 --> 11:44.350
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:44.350 --> 11:44.470
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:44.350 --> 11:44.470
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:44.470 --> 11:44.600
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:44.470 --> 11:44.600
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:44.600 --> 11:44.720
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:44.600 --> 11:44.720
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:44.720 --> 11:44.850
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:44.720 --> 11:44.850
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:44.850 --> 11:44.970
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:44.850 --> 11:44.970
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:44.970 --> 11:45.430
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:44.970 --> 11:45.430
Ougi West         Karasuno

11:45.430 --> 11:46.200
Cover me!

11:46.200 --> 11:47.060
Number eight!

11:47.060 --> 11:48.850
<i>Only one blocker... I can do it!</i>

11:52.440 --> 11:53.650
Nice, Nishinoya!

11:52.440 --> 11:54.690
Ougi West          Karasuno

11:52.440 --> 11:54.690
Ougi West          Karasuno

11:53.150 --> 11:54.690
What amazing reflexes...

11:53.650 --> 11:54.470
Hey, don't run!

11:54.470 --> 11:55.360
Kageyama!

11:55.360 --> 11:56.020
Right!

11:59.320 --> 12:00.650
All right!

11:59.320 --> 12:03.070
Ougi West          Karasuno

11:59.320 --> 12:03.070
Ougi West          Karasuno

12:00.650 --> 12:03.070
That one looked like it could've ripped his arm off.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.070
Asahi, nice spike!

12:05.530 --> 12:07.280
Nice receive, Daichi!

12:05.990 --> 12:08.240
<i>They're really solid.</i>

12:07.280 --> 12:08.240
Left!

12:10.450 --> 12:19.170
Ougi West            Karasuno

12:10.450 --> 12:19.170
Ougi West            Karasuno

12:10.960 --> 12:12.330
All right!

12:12.330 --> 12:14.170
That's so loud.

12:14.880 --> 12:15.920
Right?

12:15.920 --> 12:19.170
But if our two strongmen distract you...

12:20.780 --> 12:22.760
you lose sight of the small crow.

12:29.810 --> 12:31.020
<i>I can fly!</i>

12:32.270 --> 12:34.230
Ougi West            Karasuno

12:32.270 --> 12:34.230
Ougi West            Karasuno

12:32.730 --> 12:34.230
If you're even one step behind,

12:34.230 --> 12:36.150
you can't catch up to him anymore.

12:37.150 --> 12:38.730
Not yet! More!

12:38.730 --> 12:40.190
I can spike even higher than that!

12:40.190 --> 12:41.190
Got it.

12:41.990 --> 12:44.410
<i>He's still not satisfied.</i>

12:47.180 --> 12:48.870
All right!

12:52.300 --> 12:54.370
Thank you very much!

12:55.830 --> 12:58.790
Karasuno                Ougi West

12:55.830 --> 12:58.790
Karasuno                Ougi West

12:57.040 --> 12:58.790
Amazing! That was amazing!

12:58.790 --> 13:02.210
I was just watching, but it was like... It was like...

13:02.210 --> 13:03.380
Did it all well up like, "whoosh"?

13:03.380 --> 13:04.470
Yeah, it did!

13:04.470 --> 13:05.550
Then be our manager!

13:05.550 --> 13:07.800
Huh? Um, uh...

13:07.260 --> 13:10.720
Am I the only one who can't understand what the hell he's saying half the time?

13:07.800 --> 13:09.720
Do it, Yachi!

13:11.270 --> 13:14.730
<i>Joining passionate people when you aren't going to give it your all</i>

13:14.730 --> 13:16.830
<i>is the rudest thing you could do.</i>

13:17.810 --> 13:24.030
For an amazing team like this, a Townsperson B like me who knows nothing of sports is just going toâ€”

13:24.030 --> 13:27.160
Come to think of it, I played Townsperson B too.

13:27.470 --> 13:28.070
Huh?

13:28.070 --> 13:31.100
I got in trouble because I tried to stand out more than the main character.

13:31.100 --> 13:33.040
Townsperson B... Heh.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.370
Hey, don't make fun of me, you bastard!

13:35.910 --> 13:39.290
There's something cool about 
Townsperson B that's unique to that role!

13:40.210 --> 13:41.340
That a fact?

13:41.340 --> 13:43.210
Then what role did you play, Kageyama?

13:43.210 --> 13:44.300
The moon.

13:44.300 --> 13:45.920
Why would you need a moon?

13:45.920 --> 13:48.720
Damn, that's actually cool!

13:47.260 --> 13:51.720
"There's something cool about 
Townsperson B that's unique to that role."

13:48.720 --> 13:50.640
I've played a horse before.

13:50.640 --> 13:51.720
A horse?!

14:17.730 --> 14:19.500
Man, you're a lifesaver!

14:19.910 --> 14:22.920
Yachi, thanks for helping us study on a Saturday!

14:22.920 --> 14:23.880
Thanks.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.960
Sure. Let's do our best on the exam.

14:25.960 --> 14:27.970
Oh, sorry for the intrusion.

14:27.970 --> 14:29.220
It's fine.

14:29.220 --> 14:31.430
Was she a good teacher?

14:31.730 --> 14:34.560
Yeah! I'm gonna nail that exam for sure now! Probably!

14:34.560 --> 14:35.890
<i>Only probably?</i>

14:35.890 --> 14:39.230
Rather, I won't let Yachi's kindness go to waste!

14:41.090 --> 14:43.770
Kind... "Of a sympathetic or helpful nature."

14:43.770 --> 14:47.900
"A term used to express a caring attitude one has for another."

14:47.900 --> 14:50.820
<i>Oh, the definition of the word we studied earlier.</i>

14:51.200 --> 14:53.380
I see. Good luck on your exam.

14:53.380 --> 14:54.160
Thanks!

14:55.410 --> 14:57.830
Let's go to Tokyo together, Yachi!

14:57.830 --> 14:59.450
Huh? R-Right...

15:00.250 --> 15:03.340
<i>I haven't even explained anything to my mom yet!</i>

15:03.340 --> 15:04.960
See you next week!

15:04.960 --> 15:06.300
B-Bye...

15:10.640 --> 15:12.890
Hitoka, what's this about away games in Tokyo?

15:13.600 --> 15:15.810
W-Well, um, uh...

15:15.810 --> 15:18.150
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

15:18.150 --> 15:19.560
Let's go.

15:19.560 --> 15:21.900
All right, I'm heading to a meeting.

15:21.900 --> 15:24.270
I'll be back late again tonight.

15:24.270 --> 15:25.730
Oh, okay.

15:26.380 --> 15:27.570
Okay, let's go.

15:28.230 --> 15:30.070
Huh? Uh, wait a sec!

15:30.070 --> 15:32.990
Wasn't Hitoka trying to tell you something?

15:32.990 --> 15:34.030
Are you okay?

15:34.030 --> 15:36.370
Oh, it's nothing.

15:36.370 --> 15:37.910
Go ahead.

15:37.910 --> 15:39.910
Okay... See you later.

15:39.910 --> 15:40.610
Yep.

15:41.260 --> 15:43.790
Jeez, you're doing it again...

15:46.040 --> 15:48.460
Yachi's notes are so awesome!

15:48.460 --> 15:50.010
All notes should be like these.

15:50.010 --> 15:52.930
If Yachi joins, we'll have two managers.

15:52.930 --> 15:55.280
We'd be like a powerhouse school then.

15:55.280 --> 15:56.060
Yeah.

15:56.060 --> 15:58.610
What? You don't want her to join?

15:58.610 --> 16:00.520
That's her decision.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.650
You sure are a hard sell.

16:04.650 --> 16:06.060
You're not popular with girls, are you?

16:06.060 --> 16:07.110
Mind your own business!

16:08.400 --> 16:11.150
Crap! I forgot a textbook at her house!

16:11.150 --> 16:13.110
I'm gonna go back and get it!

16:13.110 --> 16:14.490
See ya, Kageyama!

16:19.250 --> 16:20.160
Here.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.160
Thanks, Yachi!

16:22.160 --> 16:23.330
That was close!

16:23.330 --> 16:24.540
I'm glad I realized it.

16:25.580 --> 16:29.240
U-Um... Do you have a second?

16:29.240 --> 16:30.210
Sure.

16:32.130 --> 16:32.670
Huh?

16:32.970 --> 16:35.640
You're not sure you want to join over something like that?

16:37.050 --> 16:40.560
I mean, I've hit Kageyama in the back of the head with a serve,

16:40.970 --> 16:43.060
puked in Tanaka's lap,

16:43.550 --> 16:45.230
and knocked the vice principal's toupÃ©e off,

16:46.460 --> 16:48.350
but I'm still playing volleyball just fine!

16:48.350 --> 16:50.900
Were you really fine after that?

16:51.360 --> 16:53.450
But you want to do this, right?

16:53.450 --> 16:55.740
Y-Yes...

16:56.950 --> 16:58.870
Then you totally should!

16:58.870 --> 17:00.870
Right.

17:03.330 --> 17:06.200
Is what your mom said bothering you?

17:06.200 --> 17:07.630
Oh, uh, no...

17:07.630 --> 17:09.840
It's just that, um...

17:10.590 --> 17:12.090
Then why don't you tell her?

17:16.510 --> 17:18.050
She went to the station, right?

17:18.050 --> 17:19.390
Y-Yeah...

17:19.390 --> 17:20.890
<i>What is this?!</i>

17:20.890 --> 17:22.850
<i>This is ripped right out of the pages of a girls' manga!</i>

17:22.850 --> 17:25.350
<i>Wow, he's fast! He runs so fast!</i>

17:28.810 --> 17:30.070
Wait...

17:33.020 --> 17:35.530
At this rate, you can't move forward.

17:35.820 --> 17:37.530
If you want to do this, you need to tell her.

17:41.950 --> 17:44.870
<i>Whether I want to join the volleyball team or not,</i>

17:44.870 --> 17:48.420
<i>at this rate, I'll keep on being a loser.</i>

17:49.790 --> 17:52.570
<i>I have to say it.</i>

17:56.030 --> 17:58.300
Yeah, I have to tell her.

17:58.970 --> 18:00.300
Thanks, Hinata.

18:01.760 --> 18:04.220
SUBWAY PLATFORMS

18:01.760 --> 18:04.220
SUBWAY PLATFORMS

18:04.730 --> 18:08.440
You weren't strong right away either, were you?

18:08.900 --> 18:12.150
You can't expect the same strength from Hitoka.

18:12.150 --> 18:15.030
She's just starting to grow.

18:15.690 --> 18:17.860
Mom!

18:18.660 --> 18:19.820
Hitoka?!

18:23.110 --> 18:25.250
Townsperson B can fight too!

18:25.540 --> 18:26.230
Huh?!

18:26.230 --> 18:27.500
Townsperson B?

18:27.990 --> 18:33.460
I'm going to be the volleyball team manager!

18:34.390 --> 18:37.170
I-I see... Do your best.

18:37.460 --> 18:38.270
I will!

18:39.020 --> 18:40.180
What do you want to do for dinner?!

18:40.180 --> 18:42.400
I-I'll eat there!

18:42.400 --> 18:43.970
Roger that!

18:50.100 --> 18:52.230
All right! Two managers!

18:52.230 --> 18:53.610
We're just like a powerhouse!

18:53.610 --> 18:58.780
Um, I have a favor to ask you and Kageyama.

18:58.780 --> 18:59.640
What is it?

19:01.410 --> 19:02.200
You're crying?!

19:02.200 --> 19:04.450
Shut up! Give me a tissue!

19:05.330 --> 19:06.490
Pardon me.

19:07.540 --> 19:08.950
Mr. Takeda.

19:08.950 --> 19:10.120
