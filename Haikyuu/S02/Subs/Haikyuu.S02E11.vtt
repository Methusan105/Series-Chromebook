Akaashi...

00:10.120 --> 00:12.400
Don't set for me anymore today!

00:12.990 --> 00:14.180
Okay.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.270
Huh?

00:15.270 --> 00:18.340
But in exchange, please calm down.

00:21.810 --> 00:24.780
I don't know what's going on,
 but their ace doesn't seem to be doing well!

00:24.780 --> 00:25.990
Let's keep it up!

00:25.990 --> 00:28.000
Yeah!

00:28.000 --> 00:28.000
{OP}

00:37.050 --> 00:41.940
I keep running as I run out of breath

00:41.940 --> 00:46.850

00:51.780 --> 00:56.450
If I come to a standstill

00:56.910 --> 01:01.620
People ask me why I find joy in this

01:01.620 --> 01:06.200
But I don't understand it myself

01:06.670 --> 01:11.090
Running is the only thing on my mind

01:11.090 --> 01:15.260
Even if nothing goes right in the future

01:15.260 --> 01:20.890
I won't stop trying to find the best version of myself

01:20.890 --> 01:25.190
Even if someone tells me that this is as far as I go

01:25.190 --> 01:27.270
And draws the line on me

01:27.270 --> 01:31.210
I'll say no, thank you, and surge on ahead

01:31.860 --> 01:32.700
So what?

01:32.700 --> 01:34.320
Whatever the future may bring

01:34.320 --> 01:35.030
So what?

01:35.030 --> 01:36.820
However people are supposed to act

01:36.820 --> 01:37.560
So what?

01:37.560 --> 01:41.260
It doesn't really matter

01:43.240 --> 01:46.190
So I'm a believer

Episode Eleven: 
"Up Above"

02:04.730 --> 02:05.810
All right!

02:06.180 --> 02:07.550
Nice spike!

02:08.210 --> 02:09.770
Yeah!

02:14.190 --> 02:15.940
All right!

02:14.190 --> 02:15.690
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

02:14.190 --> 02:15.690
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

02:15.690 --> 02:15.820
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

02:15.690 --> 02:15.820
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

02:15.820 --> 02:15.940
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

02:15.820 --> 02:15.940
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

02:15.940 --> 02:16.070
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

02:15.940 --> 02:16.070
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

02:16.070 --> 02:16.320

02:16.320 --> 02:16.400

02:16.400 --> 02:19.160
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

02:16.400 --> 02:19.160
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

02:17.030 --> 02:22.530
M-Maybe I'm just imagining it, 
but it doesn't seem like Fukurodani is fazed at all.

02:22.530 --> 02:23.620
Yeah...

02:24.580 --> 02:25.730
Here's a chance!

02:25.730 --> 02:27.040
Here.

02:27.580 --> 02:30.750
<i>Right now, there are two attackers up front for Fukurodani.</i>

02:31.460 --> 02:33.920
<i>Will they do a fast attack from the middle,</i>

02:33.920 --> 02:35.170
<i>a back row attack,</i>

02:35.810 --> 02:38.470
<i>or will number four finally come back?</i>

02:42.450 --> 02:43.640
A setter dump!

02:43.640 --> 02:45.770
Fukurodani's back in the lead!

02:43.640 --> 02:47.600
Karasuno                   Fukurodani

02:43.640 --> 02:47.600
Karasuno                   Fukurodani

02:45.770 --> 02:47.600
And the ace hasn't even scored once!

02:47.980 --> 02:53.820
Bokuto may look like the eldest son of the family, 
but he's actually the youngest.

02:52.770 --> 02:53.820
Nice, Akaashi!

02:54.150 --> 02:55.320
Thank you.

02:54.150 --> 02:56.280
Though he <i>is</i> the strongest individually.

02:58.900 --> 02:59.820
Nice receive!

02:59.280 --> 03:01.910
<i>We're used to Bokuto's slumps.</i>

03:01.910 --> 03:06.160
<i>The smallest thing can make him happy or depressed.</i>

03:04.980 --> 03:06.160
Left!

03:06.160 --> 03:08.410
<i>What are we gonna do with him?</i>

03:10.870 --> 03:11.710
All right!

03:10.870 --> 03:11.250
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

03:10.870 --> 03:11.250
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

03:11.250 --> 03:11.370
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

03:11.250 --> 03:11.370
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

03:11.370 --> 03:11.500
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

03:11.370 --> 03:11.500
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

03:11.500 --> 03:11.580
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

03:11.500 --> 03:11.580
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

03:11.580 --> 03:11.870
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

03:11.580 --> 03:11.870
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

03:11.710 --> 03:13.380
Fukurodani's on match point!

03:11.870 --> 03:11.960
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

03:11.870 --> 03:11.960
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

03:11.960 --> 03:13.380
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

03:11.960 --> 03:13.380
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

03:13.380 --> 03:15.670
Just one more point!

03:16.400 --> 03:23.800
I guess Fukurodani isn't a team that Bokuto leads, but one where the team leads the way for him.

03:25.050 --> 03:25.850
I touched it!

03:27.450 --> 03:30.980
<i>I understand now that Fukurodani isn't a one-man team of Bokuto.</i>

03:31.850 --> 03:32.690
<i>That said...</i>

03:35.510 --> 03:38.320
<i>He's definitely the scariest person on their team.</i>

03:38.320 --> 03:40.190
Totally shut out!

03:40.190 --> 03:42.530
All right! Just one more point for a deuce!

03:40.530 --> 03:42.990
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

03:40.530 --> 03:42.990
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

03:42.990 --> 03:44.740
Wow...

03:44.740 --> 03:46.240
Well done.

03:48.380 --> 03:51.460
<i>If I mess up the serve here, the match will instantly end.</i>

03:51.460 --> 03:52.540
<i>I'll...</i>

03:53.170 --> 03:54.630
<i>definitely make this one land!</i>

03:56.240 --> 03:56.840
Komi!

03:57.420 --> 03:58.550
Yeah!

03:58.550 --> 03:59.840
Nice receive!

04:01.050 --> 04:04.550
<i>I'm sure Karasuno's figured out 
what kind of team we are by now.</i>

04:05.140 --> 04:08.010
<i>Which means their attention is off of the ace.</i>

04:08.690 --> 04:12.600
<i>And he wants to spike so bad that he's getting fidgety!</i>

04:16.440 --> 04:18.610
<i>We'll let you have the spotlight.</i>

04:19.400 --> 04:20.190
<i>So...</i>

04:21.390 --> 04:23.280
<i>pick yourself back up...</i>

04:23.280 --> 04:24.590
<i>ace!</i>

04:36.920 --> 04:37.290
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

04:36.920 --> 04:37.290
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

04:37.290 --> 04:37.420
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

04:37.290 --> 04:37.420
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

04:37.420 --> 04:37.540
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

04:37.420 --> 04:37.540
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

04:37.540 --> 04:37.630
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

04:37.540 --> 04:37.630
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

04:37.630 --> 04:37.920
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

04:37.630 --> 04:37.920
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

04:37.920 --> 04:38.000
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

04:37.920 --> 04:38.000
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

04:38.000 --> 04:39.630
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

04:38.000 --> 04:39.630
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

04:52.190 --> 04:53.140
<i>Please.</i>

04:53.940 --> 04:55.100
<i>Leave it to us.</i>

04:55.770 --> 04:57.230
Nice job, ace!

04:57.230 --> 04:58.610
That was awesome!

04:58.610 --> 05:01.230
In the end, it just <i>has</i> to be the ace!

05:01.230 --> 05:03.210
Oh no! It's a raptor!

05:03.210 --> 05:04.990
Your hair's like a great horned owl!

05:09.770 --> 05:14.910
I'm truly the best!

05:14.910 --> 05:16.920
Hey, hey, hey!

05:16.920 --> 05:18.880
Hey, hey, hey...

05:19.290 --> 05:22.420
He's able to pick himself back up so quickly.

05:22.420 --> 05:24.840
So that's what you call simple-minded.

05:25.170 --> 05:28.930
<i>The weakness of their ace draws out the strengths of the other members.</i>

05:28.930 --> 05:33.180
<i>And at the same time, it becomes
 the root that holds the team together.</i>

05:33.180 --> 05:35.390
<i>I guess that's another form of strength.</i>

05:36.140 --> 05:43.150
To be honest, I was thinking we might be okay if we 
were able to stop Bokuto, but I guess that was naïve.

05:43.780 --> 05:48.030
I bet he's allowed the freedom to do 
whatever he wants without them caring

05:48.030 --> 05:50.830
Aren't I awesome, Akaashi?!

05:48.490 --> 05:51.580
because they have complete faith in one another.

05:50.830 --> 05:51.990
For sure, Bokuto.

05:52.740 --> 05:56.910
Our team just isn't at the point where any of them can be that selfish yet.

05:58.460 --> 05:59.670
I'm sorry!

05:59.670 --> 06:03.920
That last serve was a total meatball because I chickened out!

06:05.670 --> 06:08.510
If you can realize that all by yourself, you're doing just fine.

06:10.010 --> 06:15.140
What determines whether you can win or not is 
how aggressive you can be in situations like that.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.980
Nobody wants to end a match
 because of a mistake they made.

06:18.980 --> 06:20.190
He's talking about you.

06:20.190 --> 06:21.610
Shut up!

06:21.610 --> 06:27.070
But nobody will blame you for trying to hit a serve to take the win, either.

06:28.240 --> 06:29.160
Yes, sir!

06:29.490 --> 06:33.660
Anyway, that was one hell of a losing streak we went on.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.870
Though one thing is for certain.

06:38.610 --> 06:42.420
Your offense will work against the top teams in the country!

06:52.690 --> 06:57.430
Right now, your serves and combo attacks are no match for our opponent's.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.770
This is no surprise since you guys started practicing them way later.

07:01.680 --> 07:04.270
But that doesn't mean you should give up.

07:04.270 --> 07:07.230
Don't think that you've reached your limit.

07:07.800 --> 07:11.780
You know how when you mix colors, they become muddled and dirty?

07:12.660 --> 07:17.290
But once you finish mixing, you get the
 color which no other can overtake—black.

07:17.920 --> 07:20.710
Please make our team black, a fitting color for crows.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.460
Oops! Was my metaphor too difficult to understand?

07:25.460 --> 07:27.710
No! Thank you very much, sir!

07:28.130 --> 07:30.300
Thank you very much, sir!

07:30.300 --> 07:32.890
All right, time for our last penalty of the training camp!

07:33.260 --> 07:34.760
One lap of diving drills!

07:34.760 --> 07:36.180
Yessir!

07:39.810 --> 07:40.790
Asahi!

07:41.230 --> 07:44.900
There's still a little time left, 
so could you hit some of my sets?

07:44.900 --> 07:46.400
Sure thing.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.440
Noya! Let me hit a few too!

07:48.440 --> 07:50.380
Sounds good, Ryuu!

07:50.380 --> 07:51.900
Oh, me too.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.530
You'll throw them up for us, Suga?

07:54.530 --> 07:55.450
That'll be perfect!

07:55.450 --> 07:56.910
Um, not exactly.

07:58.010 --> 07:59.040
I'm gonna spike.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.870
Damn it.

08:03.870 --> 08:08.090
If we'd practiced our fast attack just a bit more, 
we might've been able to take a set off of Fukurodani.

08:08.950 --> 08:11.340
But we have a way to fight them now.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.760
Even if they can predict our moves or catch up to us...

08:16.680 --> 08:17.720
we can fight!

08:20.730 --> 08:22.390
That all depends on my sets.

08:22.390 --> 08:24.440
It's fine. You'll get there eventually.

08:24.440 --> 08:26.690
Don't tell me what I'm gonna do!

08:26.690 --> 08:27.980
Are you saying you won't?

08:27.980 --> 08:29.820
Of course I'll get there eventually, moron!

08:29.820 --> 08:31.240
So I <i>was</i> right!

08:32.140 --> 08:34.030
Let's go practice that fast attack!

08:32.590 --> 08:35.240
It's a good thing being that stupid isn't contagious.

08:34.030 --> 08:35.240
Yeah!

08:38.330 --> 08:41.370
We head straight into the spring tourney prelims as soon as we get back.

08:41.370 --> 08:45.290
Yeah. The next time we'll come back to Tokyo will be after that.

08:45.290 --> 08:47.590
I hope it won't be as hot then.

08:47.880 --> 08:49.550
Nah, it'll probably still be warm.

08:49.550 --> 08:51.210
What's his problem, Suga?

08:51.210 --> 08:54.470
If we don't make it through the prelims,
 the three of us won't be able to come back.

08:54.470 --> 08:56.990
Oh look, it's Mr. Gloomy Goatee!

08:56.990 --> 08:57.550
Wh-What...

08:57.970 --> 09:00.820
Of course we'll be coming back, moron!

09:00.820 --> 09:02.980
You're right. Sorry.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.980
Begone, gloom!

09:05.690 --> 09:08.770
Actually, you sounded like Kageyama just now.

09:09.110 --> 09:10.940
Moron! Hinata, you moron!

09:10.940 --> 09:11.530
It's perfect!

09:11.530 --> 09:12.230
Do it again!

09:12.790 --> 09:16.410
I-It feels like I'm getting an extra scolding somehow...

09:16.410 --> 09:17.450
What?

09:21.360 --> 09:24.250
Hell yeah! It's meat time!

09:24.250 --> 09:25.870
I could eat an entire cow!

09:26.210 --> 09:29.290
Take the plates over to where Miyanoshita is.

09:29.290 --> 09:29.590
Sure.

09:29.920 --> 09:30.920
There we go.

09:33.360 --> 09:36.750
So even Bokuto has slumps.

09:36.750 --> 09:37.860
Yeah.

09:37.860 --> 09:40.300
He sometimes self-destructs in bizarre ways.

09:41.260 --> 09:45.350
On the other hand, he doesn't care how good our opponents are, so it works out in the end.

09:45.350 --> 09:49.900
When everyone else on the team loses hope, he's usually still pretty energetic.

09:49.900 --> 09:51.730
Despite everything, he's pretty reliable.

09:51.730 --> 09:52.840
Bokuto!

09:53.230 --> 09:55.860
W-We're not gonna lose in an actual match!

09:55.860 --> 09:59.230
Oh yeah?! Bring it on, then!

10:04.100 --> 10:06.250
Before spring nationals,

10:06.620 --> 10:09.220
we need to have our meat war, Hinata!

10:10.250 --> 10:10.960
Ahem.

10:11.750 --> 10:14.670
Thank you for all the hard work
 in this week-long training camp!

10:15.380 --> 10:18.380
Tasty food smiles at the sound of hunger.

10:18.880 --> 10:22.100
Feel free to repair your muscles as much as you wish!

10:24.060 --> 10:26.770
Thanks for the food!

10:35.650 --> 10:37.900
So then, Kenma...

10:38.820 --> 10:40.110
Stop right there!

10:40.110 --> 10:42.450
Don't steal my food, you bastard!

10:42.830 --> 10:44.200
Have some rice balls too!

10:44.200 --> 10:46.250
Oh, thank—

10:47.250 --> 10:48.160
What?!

10:52.010 --> 10:54.170
Do you understand, Ryuu?

10:54.170 --> 10:55.340
Of course.

10:55.340 --> 10:56.260
Tora?

10:56.260 --> 10:57.260
Yes, Master.

10:57.560 --> 11:03.470
Do not allow for any dudes to use these 
good spirits as an excuse to approach Kiyoko!

11:03.470 --> 11:04.970
As you wish!

11:09.500 --> 11:10.310
Go!

11:10.310 --> 11:11.850
You go!

11:21.610 --> 11:24.410
Why is Nishinoya the master?

11:24.410 --> 11:29.710
Apparently, it's because he's the only one to have been slapped by Shimizu.

11:29.710 --> 11:30.750
I see...

11:30.750 --> 11:32.290
Tsukishima!

11:32.580 --> 11:34.170
You need to eat more!

11:34.540 --> 11:37.000
There's no way I can eat that much.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.380
C'mon! Eat some veggies too!

11:39.380 --> 11:41.290
Kenma! You eat some too, damn it!

11:41.290 --> 11:42.590
Eat some rice!

11:42.590 --> 11:45.010
You mean meat! Eat some meat, Tsukki!

11:45.010 --> 11:46.720
You won't grow big otherwise!

11:46.720 --> 11:48.560
Are they, like, some pushy uncles?

11:48.560 --> 11:50.850
And he's the young, defiant nephew who can't stand them.

11:50.850 --> 11:54.100
The generals totally see that and are having fun with it.

11:55.270 --> 11:56.770
Hey, Suga.

11:57.490 --> 12:01.060
One of your managers is acting really strange. Is she okay?

12:01.530 --> 12:03.880
<i>Th-This is like...</i>

12:06.260 --> 12:08.160
<i>a jungle of giants!</i>

12:10.940 --> 12:13.080
<i>The meat smells so good... I wanna eat some...</i>

12:13.750 --> 12:14.710
Is this done already?

12:13.750 --> 12:16.920
<i>But if I carelessly rush in there, they might eat me by accident!</i>

12:14.710 --> 12:16.920
Hey, I was planning on eating that!

12:16.920 --> 12:18.550
<i>Or worse, barbecue me!</i>

12:19.670 --> 12:21.590
Can you reach? Would you like me to get you something?

12:22.270 --> 12:24.010
I promise I don't taste good!

12:24.720 --> 12:27.430
Er, I mean, I'm fine! Thanks!

12:27.430 --> 12:29.950
I was thinking about eating this.

12:32.390 --> 12:34.400
I-It's delicious.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.610
It tastes like real life...

12:37.640 --> 12:41.440
Yacchan? The one you just ate looked really charred. Are you all right?

12:41.980 --> 12:42.860
Want some tea?

12:43.610 --> 12:44.660
There's water too.

12:45.300 --> 12:48.330
Doesn't that look a bit sketchy to you?

12:48.330 --> 12:48.870
Yeah...

12:49.620 --> 12:52.580
They'd probably get the cops called on them if this was in the city.

12:52.580 --> 12:54.620
I definitely wouldn't want to be surrounded by them.

13:02.830 --> 13:05.760
I'd much rather have them surround me.

13:05.760 --> 13:09.600
Karasuno's third-years seem like they have their act together.

13:10.010 --> 13:14.690
Our managers are all quite beautiful,

13:14.690 --> 13:18.150
but with Karasuno joining us,
 I think it has gone up one notch further.

13:18.150 --> 13:19.410
What do you think?

13:19.410 --> 13:20.440
I cannot argue.

13:20.900 --> 13:22.820
Our ace is pretty weak-willed, though.

13:22.820 --> 13:24.360
What? Really?

13:24.360 --> 13:26.450
He sure <i>looks</i> scary.

13:26.450 --> 13:29.910
That's probably better than having such a simple-minded ace.

13:27.600 --> 13:28.640
What?!

13:28.640 --> 13:31.830
You're in the nation's top five?!

13:31.830 --> 13:33.660
That's awesome!

13:33.660 --> 13:35.580
Right? Right?!

13:37.010 --> 13:41.680
Ushiwaka from your region is in the top three, you know.

13:41.680 --> 13:42.500
Top three?!

13:42.500 --> 13:45.380
Hey! That really hurts, you know?!

13:45.900 --> 13:49.320
Three? Who are the other two?

13:52.460 --> 13:54.560
Ushiwaka from the Tohoku region,

13:54.560 --> 13:56.060
Kiryuu from the Kyushu region,

13:56.730 --> 13:58.730
and Sakusa from the Kanto region.

13:58.730 --> 14:02.070
Those are the three best aces in the country this year.

14:05.060 --> 14:08.490
One of those three is in Miyagi of all places.

14:08.490 --> 14:10.290
Hey, Tsukki!

14:10.290 --> 14:12.990
You practiced a ton against my spikes!

14:12.990 --> 14:15.290
I won't allow you to be intimidated by Ushiwaka!

14:15.290 --> 14:17.210
Could you please not call me that?

14:17.640 --> 14:23.130
Besides, just because they're the best doesn't mean their teams are the top three teams in the country.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.210
Yeah! Exactly!

14:24.210 --> 14:28.380
Though Sakusa's team, Itachiyama, 
is the odds-on favorite to win spring nationals.

14:29.220 --> 14:30.220
Then...

14:30.220 --> 14:33.150
...if we beat them, we'll be number one?

14:34.260 --> 14:37.480
Strong words coming from the
 top two at sucking in the country!

14:38.060 --> 14:39.520
Hinata must be number one.

14:39.520 --> 14:42.940
Kenma said that my serves and receives were better!

14:42.940 --> 14:44.020
D'oh!

14:48.050 --> 14:49.150
Coach Nekomata.

14:50.160 --> 14:52.950
Again, thank you very much for inviting us.

14:52.950 --> 14:56.410
In the end, you couldn't stop my spikes, Tsukki!

14:53.700 --> 14:56.910
It appears their change happened because we came here.

14:56.910 --> 15:01.710
No thanks needed. We got some good motivation too, 
so it was mutually beneficial.

14:57.250 --> 14:59.330
Lev, you got a cat out of a tree?

14:59.330 --> 15:02.130
Kenma's arms were too short, so he couldn't reach.

15:04.300 --> 15:09.050
Six months from now, not one team here will be the same team as it is now.

15:09.050 --> 15:12.640
The members will change, forming new teams.

15:14.050 --> 15:15.220
Man, I'm stuffed.

15:15.220 --> 15:18.060
They haven't yet played a match without any regrets.

15:15.220 --> 15:18.060
Oh, so the prelims are later in Tokyo.

15:18.060 --> 15:19.560
Well, we have a lot of schools.

15:18.060 --> 15:19.560
Not that I've seen, anyway.

15:20.210 --> 15:23.610
Still, I'd like them to play a match where they have no regrets.

15:23.610 --> 15:27.480
All we can do to achieve that is give our very best.

15:29.010 --> 15:29.740
Right.

15:39.810 --> 15:42.000
I hate being bad.

15:42.000 --> 15:42.370
Huh?

15:43.310 --> 15:46.130
But the fact that there are a lot of people up above me...

15:48.050 --> 15:50.340
makes me really excited!

15:55.010 --> 15:57.260
Well, see ya next time.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.480
Yeah, 'til next time.

eight powerhouse schools will go to that tournament in October.

16:42.390 --> 16:45.680
We can only play two matches in the prelims?

16:45.680 --> 16:51.690
Since we made it to the top 16 in the 
interhigh prelims, we got a first-round bye.

16:51.690 --> 16:54.110
Wow! We're awesome!

16:56.200 --> 16:58.580
All right, let's start with stretches!

16:56.570 --> 16:59.540
F-Finally... o-official matches...

16:58.580 --> 16:59.540
Yessir!

One, two, three, four...

17:01.700 --> 17:04.790
Oh, right. This will be your first tournament.

17:28.480 --> 17:29.400
Bring it!

17:29.400 --> 17:32.820
<i>Don't hit it to the libero. Don't hit it to the libero.</i>

17:33.180 --> 17:34.750
<i>Don't hit it to the libero!</i>

17:38.170 --> 17:40.490
<i>Why is it that it always goes there when I think that?</i>

17:40.490 --> 17:42.080
That was a good serve, Yamaguchi!

17:42.080 --> 17:43.910
It was hard to get!

17:43.910 --> 17:44.960
Oh, right...

17:45.870 --> 17:47.500
<i>He dug it out perfectly, though.</i>

17:49.040 --> 17:49.920
<i>One more time!</i>

17:50.340 --> 17:52.880
What are you concentrating so hard on?

17:52.880 --> 17:54.130
Oh, Ukai.

17:54.720 --> 18:01.220
Well, I was thinking that while our first-years are amazing, there are tons of other amazing first-years too.

18:01.220 --> 18:01.890
Yeah.

18:01.890 --> 18:03.790
That guy, huh?

18:01.890 --> 18:07.520
Kakugawa Academy

18:01.890 --> 18:07.520
Kakugawa Academy

18:03.790 --> 18:05.310
He sure is something.

18:09.860 --> 18:10.480
I'm home.

18:12.860 --> 18:15.490
Whoa, Kei. You grew even taller.

18:16.150 --> 18:18.100
You totally passed me by a long time ago.

18:19.450 --> 18:20.660
Big Bro.

18:20.660 --> 18:22.740
Hey. Long time no see.

18:25.410 --> 18:28.170
It's really been a while since we've gotten to talk.

18:28.750 --> 18:30.210
Has it?

18:30.210 --> 18:34.850
Even when I come home, 
you usually never leave your room other than to eat.

18:34.850 --> 18:36.130
Is that so?

18:36.880 --> 18:39.940
You look a bit different.

18:39.940 --> 18:42.100
You went to that training camp, right? Was it rough?

18:43.560 --> 18:44.880
It was fine.

18:44.880 --> 18:46.910
You've got "rough" written all over your face!

18:51.400 --> 18:53.820
You still play volleyball, right?

18:53.820 --> 18:56.270
Yeah, I'm on a team.

18:56.270 --> 18:57.690
Do you enter tournaments?

18:57.690 --> 18:58.990
Yeah, we do.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.990
You want to know why I'm still playing after what happened in high school, am I right?

19:09.820 --> 19:10.920
I'm still playing...

19:12.360 --> 19:14.380
<i>because</i> of what happened in high school.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.840
I still really regret it when I think about it.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.130
I can't take anything good from the experience at all.

19:21.270 --> 19:24.140
What you saw was such a disgrace.

19:26.930 --> 19:30.390
I didn't do anything in high school.

19:30.390 --> 19:33.190
I didn't get to experience the
 enjoyable parts of volleyball at all.

19:33.900 --> 19:36.440
But I've already experienced them.

19:38.870 --> 19:40.780
I know how good it feels to land a spike,

19:42.530 --> 19:44.240
and how proud the roar of the crowd makes me.

19:45.450 --> 19:48.530
<i>That one moment existing is the difference.</i>

19:49.500 --> 19:53.080
I want to be somewhere I can give it my very best until I'm completely satisfied.

19:55.000 --> 19:55.920
Right...

19:57.180 --> 19:58.360
I see.

20:04.550 --> 20:06.510
Ukai

20:07.510 --> 20:09.470
You guys have a tournament starting tomorrow, don't you?

20:10.420 --> 20:11.940
You should wrap it up soon!

20:11.940 --> 20:14.130
One more! Just one more!

20:14.130 --> 20:15.900
We'll finish after this one!

20:15.900 --> 20:17.270
Please!

20:16.510 --> 20:19.820
You know, this is the first time I've seen the tall boy.

20:18.780 --> 20:19.820
Just one more.

20:19.820 --> 20:20.820
Thanks!

20:19.820 --> 20:25.780
He said he didn't get enough practice today
 and begged to use our courts until we started.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.860
All right, Hinata! We're going to nail this!

20:22.860 --> 20:23.700
Yeah!

20:23.700 --> 20:25.320
Let's do this, Kageyama!

20:25.320 --> 20:26.700
I know!

20:25.780 --> 20:27.660
It seems he's the setter from Shou's school.

20:27.660 --> 20:28.790
Is that so?

20:28.790 --> 20:30.130
Here we go!

20:31.160 --> 20:35.000
I've been watching for a while, but they keep messing up.

20:49.140 --> 20:52.140
Whoa! Aone, have you gotten even taller?!

20:52.140 --> 20:54.900
What's this? Dropping by again, Kamasaki?

20:54.900 --> 20:55.700
Nothing better to do?

20:55.700 --> 20:56.940
Having trouble finding a job?

20:56.940 --> 20:58.540
Aren't your sleeves rolled up too far?

20:58.540 --> 21:01.580
Futakuchi, you punk! You should be more appreciative of your—

21:04.000 --> 21:04.570
Hey, Kunimi.

21:05.580 --> 21:08.280
Was that story Oikawa told for real?

21:08.280 --> 21:09.530
Seemed real to me.

21:10.010 --> 21:12.120
I mean, he does pretty reckless things.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.040
What? Torino?

21:19.040 --> 21:20.570
It's Karasuno.

21:20.570 --> 21:22.880
Where's that? Never heard of it.

21:23.380 --> 21:28.090
If we can defeat Shiratorizawa, 
no one else in the prefecture stands a chance.

21:28.790 --> 21:30.560
Simple as that.

21:36.980 --> 21:39.690
{=2}Better too big than too small

21:36.980 --> 21:39.690
{=1}Better too big than too small

21:44.440 --> 21:47.360
<i>I'm Hinata Shouyou, from the concrete.</i>

21:48.450 --> 21:49.990
<i>I'm gonna crush you</i>

21:50.620 --> 21:51.660
<i>and go to nationals.</i>

21:54.290 --> 21:55.480
One more.

<i>The preliminary round of the
 Miyagi qualifiers begins today!</i>

22:15.020 --> 22:15.020
{ED}

22:27.990 --> 22:33.560
We climb the mountain in our way

22:34.080 --> 22:40.130
Losing more than just time in the process

22:40.130 --> 22:46.140
Tasting freedom makes us want to fly

22:46.260 --> 22:52.200
And notice the feelings welling up inside

22:52.470 --> 22:55.600
It's almost in our reach

22:55.600 --> 22:58.690
The closer we get, the more it shines

22:58.690 --> 23:01.480
And stretches out in front of our eyes

23:01.480 --> 23:04.850
That panorama created just for us

23:04.850 --> 23:11.110
Until I reach the top and come back down, my lungs will keep breathing

23:11.110 --> 23:17.370
But now I've been possessed by the desire to climb that summit once again

23:17.370 --> 23:23.230
We cast aside all our doubt and set flight to the skies

23:23.230 --> 23:30.390
Our flailing hands reach out and grab hold of the moment

23:31.750 --> 23:33.390
That special moment

23:34.860 --> 23:39.370
Come to us climbers

23:39.920 --> 23:42.110
Come to us right now

23:45.070 --> 23:45.070

<i>Sometimes just having a super-tall guy can be the difference between victory and defeat!</i>

23:49.000 --> 23:50.980
<i>I'm not tall enough that you need to add "super."</i>

23:50.980 --> 23:53.280
<i>Height is a weapon in its own right!</i>

23:53.280 --> 23:54.350
<i>You're so not cute.</i>

23:54.350 --> 23:57.370
<i>Please don't look for cuteness in a guy who's almost 190 cm tall.</i>
