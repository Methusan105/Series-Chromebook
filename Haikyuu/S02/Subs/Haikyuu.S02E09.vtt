<i>Dear Mom.</i>

00:08.660 --> 00:12.540
<i>The weather in Tokyo is cool, 
but it's hotter than the Tohoku region.</i>

00:12.540 --> 00:15.620
<i>Today is the third day of the week-long training camp.</i>

00:16.020 --> 00:17.910
<i>We're almost at the turning point.</i>

00:19.120 --> 00:20.160
Go!

00:21.290 --> 00:22.210
So hot...

00:22.210 --> 00:23.580
Saying "hot" is banned!

00:24.170 --> 00:26.540
<i>Everyone seems to be getting fatigued.</i>

00:27.880 --> 00:32.420
<i>Also, it's been roughly three weeks since Hinata and Kageyama butted heads.</i>

00:32.420 --> 00:33.130
Here.

00:32.420 --> 00:33.420
Here.

00:33.130 --> 00:33.970
Thanks.

00:33.420 --> 00:34.730
Thank you!

00:35.220 --> 00:39.890
<i>Even though they're practicing together, they still aren't talking.</i>

00:49.900 --> 00:51.110
All right!

00:50.230 --> 00:51.650
A service ace!

00:51.650 --> 00:55.280
It might be slow going,
 but everyone is starting to make fewer mistakes.

00:55.280 --> 00:58.280
And they narrow the point gap with every set they play.

00:55.280 --> 00:58.280
{=1}Fukurodani                    Karasuno

00:55.280 --> 00:58.280
{=0}Fukurodani                    Karasuno

00:58.660 --> 01:01.910
<i>I can only marvel at everyone's daily progress.</i>

01:01.910 --> 01:05.750
<i>I was a bit worried about how spiritless Tsukishima was,</i>

01:05.750 --> 01:09.420
<i>but apparently that's just how he usually looks.</i>

01:05.750 --> 01:08.420
Asahi, give us another good one like that!

01:08.420 --> 01:09.420
Give us a good serve.

01:09.420 --> 01:13.720
<i>Although he must be exhausted, I'm a bit relieved to see he's still playing like he usually does.</i>

01:14.260 --> 01:15.010
<i>However...</i>

01:18.890 --> 01:20.850
<i>Damn it! It was short again!</i>

01:20.850 --> 01:22.560
Yes!

01:21.180 --> 01:23.020
Don't worry about it! We'll get the next one!

01:23.020 --> 01:24.060
I'm sorry!

01:24.980 --> 01:30.320
<i>Hinata and Kageyama's new 
fast attack isn't going too well.</i>

01:30.320 --> 01:31.770
<i>During this training camp—</i>

01:32.820 --> 01:34.070
Sorry!

01:37.460 --> 01:42.870
<i>During this training camp,
 I'd like to see it succeed at least one time.</i>

01:41.240 --> 01:42.080
Thanks.

01:43.950 --> 01:43.950

01:53.050 --> 01:57.940
I keep running as I run out of breath

I feel like I'll be left behind in this world

02:07.770 --> 02:12.450
If I come to a standstill

02:12.910 --> 02:17.620
People ask me why I find joy in this

02:17.620 --> 02:22.200
But I don't understand it myself

02:22.670 --> 02:27.080
Running is the only thing on my mind

02:27.080 --> 02:31.260
Even if nothing goes right in the future

02:31.260 --> 02:36.890
I won't stop trying to find the best version of myself

02:36.890 --> 02:41.190
Even if someone tells me that this is as far as I go

02:41.190 --> 02:43.270
And draws the line on me

02:43.270 --> 02:47.210
I'll say no, thank you, and surge on ahead

02:47.860 --> 02:48.700
So what?

02:48.700 --> 02:50.310
Whatever the future may bring

02:50.310 --> 02:51.030
So what?

02:51.030 --> 02:52.820
However people are supposed to act

02:52.820 --> 02:53.560
So what?

02:53.560 --> 02:57.260
It doesn't really matter

02:59.240 --> 03:02.190

03:14.880 --> 03:18.460
Episode Nine: 
Vs. "Umbrella"

03:23.640 --> 03:27.480
<i>It's their first long series of away games, and the temperature just keeps rising.</i>

03:28.100 --> 03:30.690
<i>It's about to get really rough for them.</i>

03:34.020 --> 03:35.730
Center!

03:36.320 --> 03:37.860
Hinata, finish it off!

03:38.400 --> 03:39.610
Sorry! It's too close to the net!

03:43.990 --> 03:45.950
Damn it!

03:43.990 --> 03:45.950
All right!

03:48.870 --> 03:50.370
<i>Everyone else is getting better.</i>

03:51.920 --> 03:55.210
<i>Even Tsukishima had a moment where he looked different.</i>

03:57.710 --> 04:00.470
<i>I'm the only one who hasn't improved!</i>

04:01.920 --> 04:05.890
I don't think I've ever seen Hinata look that bothered by something.

04:05.890 --> 04:06.720
Yeah...

04:09.100 --> 04:11.560
{=3}Nekoma                       Karasuno

04:10.740 --> 04:11.560
Here's our chance!

04:11.890 --> 04:12.940
Got it!

04:13.640 --> 04:15.310
<i>It's a chance for a fast attack!</i>

04:15.310 --> 04:16.360
<i>I'll definitely...</i>

04:16.360 --> 04:17.610
<i>get it this time!</i>

04:22.890 --> 04:24.530
Nice job!

04:24.530 --> 04:26.200
Well done, Hina—

04:24.990 --> 04:26.200
Hey!

04:26.620 --> 04:28.160
You held back, didn't you?!

04:32.210 --> 04:34.540
Held... back?

04:35.370 --> 04:37.750
Me? At volleyball?

04:39.340 --> 04:41.050
Say that again.

04:41.050 --> 04:42.050
Hey, come on.

04:42.050 --> 04:44.800
Excuse me. Can we get a timeout?

04:46.640 --> 04:49.510
That wasn't the falling set.

04:50.250 --> 04:51.720
Huh? It wasn't?

04:51.720 --> 04:53.270
No idea.

04:53.270 --> 04:55.390
You probably need an animal's instincts to tell.

04:55.390 --> 04:56.750
It wasn't?

04:56.750 --> 05:01.110
I mean, it <i>technically</i> may not have been...

05:02.010 --> 05:05.820
I figure that all the sets so far have been falling down,

05:05.820 --> 05:09.660
but the last one had more of a parabolic curve.

05:10.620 --> 05:15.540
<i>Which means Kageyama was trying to make sure Hinata hit the ball, no matter what.</i>

05:11.780 --> 05:14.080
Kageyama, calm down.

05:16.920 --> 05:20.500
Hinata hasn't comfortably hit a spike for a while now.

05:21.340 --> 05:24.380
That's pretty stressful for a spiker.

05:25.090 --> 05:30.970
Kageyama may've subconsciously been 
worried that Hinata would lose his rhythm.

05:35.470 --> 05:36.640
<i>But, Hinata...</i>

05:36.640 --> 05:38.230
Calm down, already!

05:37.140 --> 05:39.940
<i>I'm impressed you could tell, 
but is that really something to get angry about?!</i>

05:38.230 --> 05:40.690
Don't you dare fight here!

05:39.940 --> 05:42.110
<i>He was just making sure you didn't miss!</i>

05:44.310 --> 05:48.200
<i>Did I subconsciously back down just now?</i>

05:50.580 --> 05:51.990
Don't give up, Kageyama!

05:53.200 --> 05:55.540
I told you to gather 'round!

05:56.950 --> 06:00.330
<i>Are you really giving Shorty the kind of set he wants?</i>

06:01.020 --> 06:02.710
<i>Have you even tried to?</i>

06:17.740 --> 06:19.560
What are you doing, Kageyama?

06:19.940 --> 06:23.320
Starting tonight, I'm not practicing with you.

06:23.320 --> 06:26.770
And I obviously won't be using the
 new fast attack during our matches.

06:26.770 --> 06:27.900
What?!

06:28.400 --> 06:31.320
<i>Th-Their relationship has gotten even worse?</i>

06:32.210 --> 06:34.950
You're the one who said that I shouldn't give up.

06:37.960 --> 06:41.300
There's no point in practicing together right now.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.920
Uh, um...

06:44.430 --> 06:45.550
Okay!

06:46.960 --> 06:49.340
Kenma, set for me some!

06:49.340 --> 06:50.640
What?

06:49.840 --> 06:50.640
Huh?

06:55.650 --> 06:58.590
<i>Kageyama started training by himself again.</i>

06:58.590 --> 07:00.140
<i>I can't lose!</i>

07:00.140 --> 07:02.060
<i>There's only one thing I need to do right now!</i>

07:02.060 --> 07:06.340
<i>Learn how to fight the blocks in mid-air by myself!</i>

07:08.030 --> 07:10.280
Third Gymnasium

07:08.030 --> 07:10.280
Third Gymnasium

07:09.720 --> 07:12.530
Oh? Did you bring a friend today, Tsukki?

07:12.530 --> 07:13.200
Pardon?

07:15.730 --> 07:17.660
What happened to your partner?

07:17.660 --> 07:20.060
Kageyama's practicing by himself again.

07:20.060 --> 07:23.580
I tried to have Kenma set for me, but he bailed after just five!

07:23.580 --> 07:27.340
It's pretty amazing that he stuck around for even that many.

07:27.340 --> 07:28.130
So...

07:28.460 --> 07:30.510
Please let me practice with you!

07:30.510 --> 07:31.720
Lev!

07:31.720 --> 07:32.840
Oh, Hinata.

07:32.840 --> 07:37.060
I thought you were doing receiving practice with Yaku, Lev.

07:38.090 --> 07:41.810
He said I was doing well today, so he let me go early!

07:41.810 --> 07:45.190
Really? Sure you didn't run away?

07:42.190 --> 07:43.940
Hey, have you seen Lev?

07:43.940 --> 07:45.190
Maybe he's in the bathroom.

07:45.190 --> 07:47.270
No, of course not!

07:45.860 --> 07:48.820
He said you said it was okay and went running off.

07:48.820 --> 07:50.780
I didn't say that!

07:50.780 --> 07:52.610
Well, whatever.

07:52.610 --> 07:53.860
All right...

07:53.860 --> 07:55.620
Since we have the right number of people,

07:55.950 --> 07:57.450
let's play some three-on-three.

07:57.450 --> 07:58.080
What?

07:58.080 --> 07:58.950
Yay!

07:58.950 --> 08:00.500
A match!

08:00.500 --> 08:02.750
Owls                 Cats

08:00.500 --> 08:02.750
Owls                 Cats

08:04.410 --> 08:05.250
Um...

08:06.690 --> 08:09.170
Aren't these teams a bit unbalanced?

08:09.170 --> 08:10.840
<i>Whoa!</i>

08:10.840 --> 08:14.390
<i>I'm together with the ace and setter from one of Tokyo's powerhouse schools!</i>

08:14.390 --> 08:17.300
<i>And... I'm up versus Tsukishima!</i>

08:17.970 --> 08:21.430
It's fine! Let's do something we can't do in the afternoons!

08:21.730 --> 08:23.890
Woo-hoo!

08:26.140 --> 08:28.110
And when I looked over,

08:28.600 --> 08:31.710
there was a giant rhinoceros beetle! I totally freaked out!

08:31.710 --> 08:34.990
Oh, I saw a stag beetle too.

08:34.990 --> 08:36.070
Lev!

08:36.390 --> 08:38.620
I told you to jump after seeing where the set is going!

08:38.620 --> 08:39.540
Read blocking!

08:40.160 --> 08:41.500
Oh, right!

08:43.960 --> 08:46.380
Blockers, try not to jump horizontally if you can!

08:44.220 --> 08:45.750
Wow, he got it!

08:46.380 --> 08:48.920
If you can make it in time, 
come to a stop and then jump straight up!

08:48.920 --> 08:49.300
Right!

08:49.300 --> 08:50.710
We have a chance here!

08:52.760 --> 08:54.380
<i>Come to a stop</i>

08:55.310 --> 08:56.390
<i>and jump straight up.</i>

08:58.930 --> 09:00.140
Damn it!

09:00.140 --> 09:02.020
Bring it again!

09:02.020 --> 09:03.390
Um...

09:04.410 --> 09:07.350
If you don't wrap up soon,

09:07.350 --> 09:11.400
the cafeteria will close, and you won't get any dinner.

09:13.360 --> 09:16.030
We can't fight on an empty stomach.

09:16.030 --> 09:18.370
It's time to eat!

09:20.410 --> 09:21.740
Shorty.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.080
We'll continue tomorrow. Got it?

09:27.440 --> 09:28.270

<b>Haikyuu</b>

09:37.300 --> 09:44.060
<b>Second Season</b>

09:37.300 --> 09:44.060
<b>Second Season</b>

09:48.600 --> 09:49.860
Wake up!

09:49.860 --> 09:52.570
Let me sleep a little longer...

09:56.450 --> 09:59.160
<b>Cafeteria</b>

09:57.690 --> 09:59.160
Thanks for the food!

10:03.620 --> 10:08.080
How is it that you eat so much 
without growing taller even a little?

10:11.290 --> 10:13.550
Mff mmmm mrrrf.

10:15.300 --> 10:19.260
Yeah... I didn't understand a single word you just said.

10:21.220 --> 10:23.680
Ubugawa                         Karasuno

10:21.220 --> 10:23.680
Ubugawa                         Karasuno

10:21.930 --> 10:23.680
Goura, give us another good serve!

10:28.140 --> 10:30.600
It's way off! Kageyama, it's all on you!

10:30.600 --> 10:31.310
Hinata!

10:33.180 --> 10:34.190
Tanaka, just spike it!

10:34.190 --> 10:35.610
You got it!

10:38.780 --> 10:41.490
Sorry! I overcompensated!

10:41.490 --> 10:44.700
Ubugawa                         Karasuno

10:41.490 --> 10:44.700
Ubugawa                         Karasuno

10:42.990 --> 10:44.700
Thank you for the match!

10:44.700 --> 10:46.200
Let's go! Penalty sprint!

10:46.200 --> 10:47.580
Yessir!

10:47.580 --> 10:48.710
Tanaka, you run double!

10:48.710 --> 10:50.420
That's not fair!

10:50.420 --> 10:52.290
That was close.

10:52.290 --> 10:53.380
You know...

10:53.380 --> 10:54.420
Go!

10:55.840 --> 10:58.300
They've changed a bit.

11:01.170 --> 11:03.100
I'm starving...

11:03.100 --> 11:04.400
Same.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.720
I'm so hungry that I'm starting to feel sick.

11:06.720 --> 11:08.600
Same here.

11:08.600 --> 11:09.940
But seriously...

11:10.340 --> 11:12.690
I wonder how long they're gonna keep going.

11:20.910 --> 11:22.240
Next, please!

11:32.860 --> 11:33.710
Damn it!

11:36.670 --> 11:40.630
Kageyama, don't think of the bottle as a target.

11:40.630 --> 11:42.280
Actually visualize it.

11:42.280 --> 11:44.850
Visualize a spiker as best you can.

11:45.940 --> 11:48.310
Visualize a spiker...

11:54.320 --> 11:57.980
Oh, by the way, when you're going against a spiker one-on-one,

11:57.980 --> 12:00.780
you generally don't stand in front of their body.

12:00.780 --> 12:03.200
Center yourself on their dominant arm instead.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.660
Oh!

12:04.660 --> 12:05.780
Um...

12:05.780 --> 12:10.410
We're technically opponents as soon as we're in a match, right?

12:10.410 --> 12:13.000
Why are you giving us advice?

12:13.510 --> 12:17.250
Well, I've just always been a really nice person.

12:19.590 --> 12:22.170
You don't have to look at me like that.

12:24.780 --> 12:29.560
I want to make sure the Battle of the Garbage Dumpster happens again.

12:30.310 --> 12:31.890
All right, let's drink!

12:30.810 --> 12:33.190
It's what our coach wants more than anything.

12:31.890 --> 12:32.640
Yes!

12:32.640 --> 12:34.900
Huh? Where did Keishin go?

12:33.190 --> 12:37.900
But who knows how much longer he'll keep coaching?

12:35.560 --> 12:38.400
He's apparently coaching some of his players.

12:37.900 --> 12:41.570
So because of that, we need you guys to keep winning too.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.860
What? Get him over here, Takeda!

12:40.860 --> 12:42.280
Yes, sir.

12:42.810 --> 12:48.490
Anyway, this helps me get better too, so don't sweat the small stuff.

12:48.490 --> 12:50.830
Come on! Practice!

12:51.750 --> 12:53.500
Owls                 Cats

12:51.750 --> 12:53.500
Owls                 Cats

12:51.750 --> 12:53.500
2

12:51.750 --> 12:53.500
2

12:51.750 --> 12:53.500
4

12:51.750 --> 12:53.500
4

12:54.840 --> 12:55.830
Akaashi, cover it!

12:56.900 --> 12:58.380
Sorry, it's a bit short!

12:58.670 --> 13:01.630
Surround him! And make the block wide!

13:03.340 --> 13:06.800
Dammit, you're still ridiculously huge for a first-year!

13:09.240 --> 13:11.220
<i>He hit the block on purpose?</i>

13:11.950 --> 13:13.060
One more time!

13:13.060 --> 13:15.690
You'd better make this set a good one, Akaashi!

13:19.480 --> 13:22.690
Yes! Hey, hey, hey!

13:23.110 --> 13:25.650
W-Was that... on purpose?!

13:25.650 --> 13:28.070
When you lightly tapped it against the blocker's hand!

13:28.070 --> 13:29.620
Yep! It's a rebound!

13:30.390 --> 13:31.740
A rebound?

13:31.740 --> 13:33.120
That's so cool!

13:33.750 --> 13:35.410
Is it? It is, isn't it?!

13:35.410 --> 13:38.830
<i>You sure are good at flattering the airhead, Shorty.</i>

13:39.310 --> 13:41.050
If your balance is off,

13:41.050 --> 13:44.260
or you feel like you'll definitely get blocked if you try to spike,

13:44.260 --> 13:49.510
you hit the ball against the blockers on purpose so it rebounds and you can set up again.

13:52.010 --> 13:56.390
That said, it usually fails and the ball just gets hit down.

13:56.390 --> 13:58.230
That happens to you a lot, Bokuto.

13:58.230 --> 14:01.270
Akaashi, that was your cue to say,
 "That hasn't happened as much lately"!

14:02.080 --> 14:04.940
Spiking isn't all about slamming the ball into the floor.

14:04.940 --> 14:07.740
If you stay calm, you'll see the way to fight!

14:07.740 --> 14:09.880
Oh, that hasn't happened as much lately, Bokuto.

14:09.880 --> 14:11.530
You're late, Akaashi!

14:11.530 --> 14:13.490
Owls                  Cats

14:11.530 --> 14:13.490
Owls                  Cats

14:11.530 --> 14:13.490
2

14:11.530 --> 14:13.490
2

14:11.530 --> 14:13.490
4

14:11.530 --> 14:13.490
4

14:13.490 --> 14:15.200
All right!

14:18.460 --> 14:19.710
Nice one, Akaashi!

14:20.280 --> 14:21.920
Shorty, I'm counting on you to finish it!

14:21.920 --> 14:22.210
Right!

14:23.460 --> 14:24.880
Ah! Hey!

14:24.880 --> 14:27.090
Crowding him like that is so cruel!

14:27.840 --> 14:30.800
<i>This isn't merely a wall.</i>

14:31.240 --> 14:32.640
<i>It's an umbrella.</i>

14:32.640 --> 14:34.520
<i>There isn't anywhere you can hit it.</i>

14:35.640 --> 14:37.230
<i>If you stay calm,</i>

14:40.030 --> 14:42.150
<i>you'll see the way to fight.</i>

14:47.780 --> 14:50.450
<i>He hit it up?!</i>

14:54.540 --> 14:55.660
Ow...

14:56.600 --> 14:59.250
Did you actually aim that spike?

14:59.250 --> 15:02.000
That was an amazing wipe!

15:02.520 --> 15:05.920
It's true that I aimed at the tip of Lev's hand...

15:05.920 --> 15:06.710
What?!

15:07.010 --> 15:09.010
But it was just coincidence that it hit him.

15:09.010 --> 15:11.390
I can't hit that accurately—

15:11.740 --> 15:14.890
That was a triple-block of 190-cm blockers, you know?

15:14.890 --> 15:17.140
Not to mention how terrible the set was!

15:17.140 --> 15:19.950
Well done! I'm moved!

15:20.950 --> 15:24.730
To the little warrior going up against the two-meter tall wall, I—

15:24.730 --> 15:26.150
Talk about over-exaggerating.

15:26.150 --> 15:28.860
Somehow 190 cm turned into two meters.

15:29.330 --> 15:32.780
I shall give you a new special attack.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.280
A special attack?!

15:36.990 --> 15:38.540
Here's the next one!

15:47.540 --> 15:48.800
<i>Slot five.</i>

16:03.430 --> 16:04.350
One more.

16:10.020 --> 16:12.740
You must be tired after all this, Hitoka.

16:12.740 --> 16:13.610
Are you all right?

16:13.610 --> 16:15.030
Yes! I'm sorry!

16:15.510 --> 16:17.830
Today's the last day, so let's do our best.

16:17.830 --> 16:18.490
Right!

16:23.170 --> 16:24.790
Morning, Hinata!

16:25.380 --> 16:26.840
Morning, Yachi!

16:26.840 --> 16:28.040
Man, I'm starving!

16:28.040 --> 16:29.550
Oh, yeah...

16:29.550 --> 16:31.660
You sure are full of energy this morning.

16:31.660 --> 16:34.340
You were up late practicing too, weren't you?

16:34.340 --> 16:36.720
Yeah, but I just woke up.

16:37.590 --> 16:39.350
How are things shaping up?

16:40.850 --> 16:43.980
I'm practicing something super-duper awesome right now, so look forward to it!

16:43.980 --> 16:45.190
"Super-duper awesome," huh?

16:45.190 --> 16:46.810
What the heck, Tsukishima?!

16:46.810 --> 16:48.110
Nothing.

16:48.110 --> 16:50.400
Hey! Someone wake up Yamaguchi!

16:54.990 --> 16:57.620
About the thing I was telling you earlier...

16:58.200 --> 17:01.370
Yes, it's all been taken care of.

17:01.370 --> 17:03.310
It should arrive around noon.

17:03.310 --> 17:04.410
I see.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.380
For real?!

17:12.840 --> 17:15.930

{=2}Nekoma                       Fukurodani

17:16.460 --> 17:19.510
We can't seem to win against Fukurodani much.

17:18.140 --> 17:19.510
Give us a good one!

17:19.510 --> 17:23.560
I did a quick summary of the current scores!

17:21.930 --> 17:22.850
Got it!

17:23.560 --> 17:24.350
Thanks!

17:24.350 --> 17:25.270
Right!

17:24.350 --> 17:25.940
Shibayama's pretty handy.

Not much of a surprise.

17:29.770 --> 17:31.020
All right!

17:33.240 --> 17:35.700
Ubugawa                        Karasuno

17:33.240 --> 17:35.700
Ubugawa                        Karasuno

17:33.830 --> 17:35.700
Looks like Ubugawa and Karasuno finished.

17:36.270 --> 17:37.950
One lap of diving drills!

17:37.950 --> 17:39.910
Yessir!

17:40.690 --> 17:44.160
They have a strange dignity about them when they take their penalty lap.

17:44.160 --> 17:49.380
Including the previous trip, they've done multiple
 times more penalty laps than any other team here.

17:49.380 --> 17:51.380
I definitely couldn't do it.

17:49.700 --> 17:51.380
Another lap!

17:55.720 --> 17:59.760
Whoa! Karasuno's Shorty has gotten really good at diving receives!

17:59.760 --> 18:01.370
"Shorty"?

18:01.370 --> 18:05.310
Yaku, you're almost the same height as Hinata.

18:06.980 --> 18:09.560
Lev, stand over there!

18:08.020 --> 18:09.980
There was no saving him from that.

18:09.980 --> 18:13.440
I told him not to mention Yaku's height.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.190
What an idiot.

18:16.500 --> 18:19.790
Damn it! Are we just gonna keep on losing until the very end?

18:22.620 --> 18:23.950
Don't give up, guys!

18:23.950 --> 18:25.290
We have to survive.

18:26.310 --> 18:27.580
Daichi?

18:27.580 --> 18:33.630
I just happened to overhear this, 
so I thought I should keep quiet, but...

18:33.630 --> 18:35.330
Wh-What is it?!

18:38.470 --> 18:40.760
When all of these practice matches are over...

18:43.590 --> 18:46.810
the coaches are apparently going to treat us to a barbecue!

18:47.430 --> 18:48.600
Bar...

18:48.600 --> 18:49.520
...be...

18:49.520 --> 18:51.190
...cue?!

18:52.060 --> 18:54.690
Akaashi, who do we play next?

18:54.690 --> 18:55.860
Karasuno.

18:55.860 --> 18:58.150
Karasuno, huh?

18:58.150 --> 18:58.950
What?

18:58.950 --> 19:01.820
Well, they're sort of the hardest to play against.

19:01.820 --> 19:05.330
You can never tell what the hell they've got up their sleeve.

19:05.330 --> 19:08.040
But it does look like they're getting pretty tired.

19:08.040 --> 19:10.790
Meat, meat, it's what I love to eat. Meat, meat.

19:10.790 --> 19:12.540
Meat with a side of meat!

19:12.540 --> 19:13.920
Meat, meat!

19:13.920 --> 19:16.920
Hooray for meat! Energy times a hundred!

19:16.920 --> 19:18.470
What the... They're terrifying.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.220
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

19:19.220 --> 19:23.300
Meat is god! Meat is god!

19:21.680 --> 19:22.180
Sir...

19:22.740 --> 19:25.140
Did you not tell them about the barbecue?

19:25.140 --> 19:27.930
It just says "meal" on the schedule.

19:27.930 --> 19:30.270
Well, I guess all's well that ends well.

19:30.850 --> 19:33.310
Hinata, do your best in the match.

19:33.310 --> 19:34.480
Thanks!

19:34.480 --> 19:36.860
I'll be looking forward to that
 "super-duper awesome" thing.

19:36.860 --> 19:38.570
Just you watch, jerk!

19:38.860 --> 19:39.610
But...

19:40.780 --> 19:44.200
I'd love to see that new fast attack of yours soon.

19:47.150 --> 19:48.040
Me too.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.000
Huh?

19:50.540 --> 19:51.960
Kageyama!

19:52.860 --> 19:55.670
I want to hit that falling set as soon as possible!

19:58.380 --> 20:02.380
<i>He just told you yesterday that you guys won't be doing that fast attack...</i>

20:04.930 --> 20:06.260
Don't rush it.

20:06.980 --> 20:10.230
As long as I'm messing up the sets, it won't help you practice at all.

20:11.620 --> 20:13.690
What?!

20:14.190 --> 20:18.360
And I told you, how you want to hit it doesn't matter for that fast attack!

20:18.360 --> 20:21.190
I'll give you sets that won't be stopped by blocks!

20:21.190 --> 20:22.950
<i>That's how he sounded before,</i>

20:23.360 --> 20:26.660
<i>but Kageyama actually respects Hinata!</i>

20:26.660 --> 20:31.430
I was thinking this yesterday too,
 but you're really scary when you're acting considerate.

20:31.430 --> 20:34.120
I get it, but give me that set soon! I wanna hit it!

20:35.000 --> 20:38.410
That's why I'm practicing it so hard, you moron!

20:39.050 --> 20:44.840
<i>And Hinata firmly believes that Kageyama will definitely make the set something they can use.</i>

20:45.590 --> 20:46.140
<i>Oh.</i>

20:46.890 --> 20:49.560
<i>So </i>that's<i> why he got so mad before!</i>

20:50.110 --> 20:53.250
<i>He thought that it was something Kageyama could surely do,</i>

20:53.250 --> 20:56.230
<i>but Kageyama had a moment of doubt!</i>

20:57.020 --> 20:59.570
How long are you going to make me wait?

20:57.020 --> 21:01.030
<i>Hinata and Tsukishima call Kageyama "King,"</i>

21:02.320 --> 21:03.530
<i>but today,</i>

21:03.860 --> 21:06.360
<i>it looks like the crown is on Hinata's head.</i>

21:06.360 --> 21:09.530
<i>I demand the best set from thee!</i>

21:15.620 --> 21:18.080
Fukurodani                       Karasuno

21:15.620 --> 21:18.080
Fukurodani                       Karasuno

21:17.210 --> 21:21.170
Anyway, I don't care which one of the 
new things you're working on you choose,

21:21.170 --> 21:23.220
but go make one of them feel good and land!

21:23.220 --> 21:24.170
Yessir!

21:24.870 --> 21:29.600
Also, I say this every time,
 but don't let Fukurodani's number four have a field day.

21:29.600 --> 21:30.260
Right.

21:29.600 --> 21:30.260
Yessir!

21:31.020 --> 21:34.770
In the end, this camp may've been mostly just running penalty laps,

21:34.770 --> 21:39.150
but compared to the first one, 
all of you should've changed in some way.

22:07.420 --> 22:11.510
Take this as a chance to have a refreshing victory, and then let's eat some tasty meat!

22:11.510 --> 22:13.930
Yeah!

22:15.020 --> 22:15.020
{ED}

22:27.990 --> 22:33.560
We climb the mountain in our way

22:34.080 --> 22:40.130
Losing more than just time in the process

22:40.130 --> 22:46.140
Tasting freedom makes us want to fly

22:46.260 --> 22:52.200
And notice the feelings welling up inside

22:52.470 --> 22:55.600
It's almost in our reach

22:55.600 --> 22:58.690
The closer we get, the more it shines

22:58.690 --> 23:01.480
And stretches out in front of our eyes

23:01.480 --> 23:04.850
That panorama created just for us

23:04.850 --> 23:11.110
Until I reach the top and come back down, my lungs will keep breathing

23:11.110 --> 23:17.370
But now I've been possessed by the desire to climb that summit once again

23:17.370 --> 23:23.230
We cast aside all our doubt and set flight to the skies

23:23.230 --> 23:30.390
Our flailing hands reach out and grab hold of the moment

23:31.750 --> 23:33.390
That special moment

23:34.860 --> 23:39.370
Come to us climbers

23:39.920 --> 23:42.110
Come to us right now

23:45.070 --> 23:45.070
{Preview}

23:46.070 --> 23:47.530
<i>Man, meat is the best.</i>

23:47.530 --> 23:49.110
<i>And nothing goes better with it than rice.</i>

23:49.110 --> 23:50.610
<i>I like eating those together too!</i>

23:50.610 --> 23:52.280
<i>Throw in a salad, and it's perfect.</i>

23:52.710 --> 23:55.580
<i>All right! Let's win this match and eat some delicious food!</i>

23:55.580 --> 23:56.700
<i>Yeah!</i>

23:56.700 --> 23:57.830
<i>Next time on </i>Haikyuu!!<i>:</i>

23:56.790 --> 24:00.090
Episode Ten: 
Gears

23:56.790 --> 24:00.090
Episode Ten: 
Gears

23:57.830 --> 23:58.790
