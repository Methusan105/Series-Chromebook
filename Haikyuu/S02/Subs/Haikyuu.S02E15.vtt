00:02.390 --> 00:03.980
Our opponents chose to receive.

00:04.560 --> 00:05.770
We'll be serving first.

00:05.770 --> 00:06.560
All right.

00:08.230 --> 00:10.630
It's finally time for the qualifiers.

00:10.630 --> 00:13.950
Everyone looks more nervous than usual.

00:14.470 --> 00:16.450
The third-years look especially nervous.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.950
Those are so awesome!

00:19.350 --> 00:23.580
Your new glasses look so cool, Tsukishima!

00:23.580 --> 00:26.480
You've been saying that almost every day lately, Hinata.

00:26.480 --> 00:30.130
You saying they're cool messes with my self-confidence, so please stop.

00:30.130 --> 00:31.050
What'd you say?!

00:32.760 --> 00:34.760
<i>Ta-da! Here you go.</i>

00:35.590 --> 00:37.470
They're sports glasses.

00:37.470 --> 00:40.420
I made sure to find some cool-looking ones.

00:40.420 --> 00:43.290
If you wear those, 
even blocking with your face won't be scary!

00:43.290 --> 00:44.730
No, it'll still be scary.

00:46.440 --> 00:49.440
I don't care if it's Ushiwaka or Benkei. Go stop 'em all.

00:53.490 --> 00:57.470
What's up with the first-years looking more reliable than us?

00:57.470 --> 00:59.740
Us third-years don't have time to be intimidated!

00:59.740 --> 01:00.410

Leap and fly! High!

02:13.020 --> 02:17.710
Let your wings, glistening with blood, sweat, and tears

02:17.710 --> 02:20.320
Take you to wherever you need to go

02:20.320 --> 02:23.120
Unleash your unrefined impulses

02:23.120 --> 02:26.120
Uncover your instincts and bare your uncut fangs

02:26.120 --> 02:28.000
It may take an arduous path

02:28.000 --> 02:30.210
But be torn down it endlessly to achieve your dream

02:30.210 --> 02:33.210

We're finally at the qualifiers.

02:54.200 --> 02:57.460
Our first opponent was a semifinalist at the interhigh prelims.

02:57.460 --> 02:59.400
We've got our work cut out for us.

02:59.820 --> 03:02.620
You'd better go all-out on that first serve, Azumane!

03:02.990 --> 03:04.830
Karasuno, fight!

03:05.280 --> 03:07.290
Yeah!

03:06.290 --> 03:07.290

03:07.950 --> 03:09.500
Give us a good serve, Asahi!

03:09.500 --> 03:11.710
Get a nice, solid receive!

03:18.300 --> 03:19.800
Man, that's intense!

You got the last hit, Terushima!

03:23.010 --> 03:24.100
We can score here!

03:34.380 --> 03:35.570
Yahoo!

03:35.570 --> 03:37.190
Nice hit!

03:37.480 --> 03:39.620
A strong hit from the baseline?

03:39.620 --> 03:41.570
On top of that, it was right after a quick spin.

03:41.570 --> 03:44.450
Normally, you'd return it with an underhand hit.

Karasuno                        Jouzenji

You know, it's like we're up against a
 really athletic baseball team during P.E.

04:15.350 --> 04:20.610
Yeah. Their plays aren't exactly cookie-cutter, 
so we can't seem to read what they're gonna do.

04:21.490 --> 04:25.910
And the problem is none of that is happening by accident.

04:27.010 --> 04:32.330
Unpredictability is the name of the game for Jouzenji.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.460
Give us another good one!

04:37.170 --> 04:39.300
Come on, now!

04:39.300 --> 04:40.630
Sorry!

04:40.630 --> 04:42.220
Shake it off!

04:43.010 --> 04:45.090
Pick up the ball and give it to the other team!

04:45.640 --> 04:49.040
Jeez... They get out of hand so quickly.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.940
You're the only third-year left.

04:52.770 --> 04:56.520
You must have your hands full trying to deal with them.

04:57.190 --> 04:58.650
Give us a good one, Tsukishima!

05:04.030 --> 05:05.240
A fast attack!

05:05.240 --> 05:08.240
This shouldn't be a surprise, 
but I guess they can attack normally too.

05:08.240 --> 05:09.950
Karasuno

05:08.240 --> 05:09.950
Karasuno

05:13.450 --> 05:15.460
It went over the net! So lucky!

05:15.960 --> 05:16.920
Damn it!

05:16.920 --> 05:18.500
Wow, nice reflexes!

05:18.500 --> 05:20.250
But can they continue the rally?

05:22.050 --> 05:23.510
Nice save, Hinata!

05:23.510 --> 05:25.010
Whoa, he's flying!

05:25.470 --> 05:26.550
Look out!

05:28.020 --> 05:30.100
I-It's Spider-Man!

05:35.310 --> 05:35.730
In the back!

05:37.900 --> 05:39.860
Whoa, they got it back over the net!

05:40.730 --> 05:47.450
We also have some guys on our team 
who are highly athletic and unpredictable.

05:47.450 --> 05:49.030
Yeah!

05:49.480 --> 05:52.700
Well, that was definitely surprising,

05:52.700 --> 05:57.000
but Karasuno hasn't even done their ridiculous attack yet.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.880
C'mon! Bring out the killer serve!

06:04.710 --> 06:09.180
<i>The receive doesn't have to be flashy. As long as they get the ball in the air, they can do whatever is necessary.</i>

06:09.740 --> 06:13.390
<i>That's what they all think,
 and that's what they're able to do.</i>

06:14.850 --> 06:15.430
Damn it!

06:15.430 --> 06:18.060
One more time! Just spike it, Jiri!

06:18.060 --> 06:19.230
All right!

06:18.060 --> 06:20.770
Karasuno's been on the back foot the entire match.

06:22.770 --> 06:24.110
Nice receive, Daichi!

06:31.700 --> 06:34.660
There's number ten's super fast attack!

06:34.660 --> 06:36.580
Hey, Kageyama!

06:36.580 --> 06:38.290
We can't just sit here losing!

06:38.290 --> 06:40.630
So that was the fast attack I heard about.

06:39.330 --> 06:40.630
Ow!

06:40.630 --> 06:41.630
Awesome!

06:42.000 --> 06:46.210
It's hard to predict our opponent's movements, but it's not like the ball's gonna disappear.

06:46.210 --> 06:47.340
Let's calm down and have at 'em.

06:47.340 --> 06:48.630
Yeah!

06:48.630 --> 06:49.800
Well done.

06:52.260 --> 06:54.220
Karasuno                        Jouzenji

06:52.260 --> 06:54.220
Karasuno                        Jouzenji

06:53.140 --> 06:54.220
Number ten!

06:56.600 --> 06:58.020
All right!

06:58.020 --> 07:01.430
Jouzenji's really rough around the edges.

07:01.430 --> 07:06.480
Their blockers just keep jumping around, and they fall for feints a lot.

07:06.480 --> 07:10.150
Yet they're so persistent and hard to play against.

07:10.740 --> 07:14.120
I have a friend on the Jouzenji basketball team.

07:14.620 --> 07:15.930
Really?

07:15.930 --> 07:21.790
Apparently their volleyball team does nothing but two-on-two matches for over half of their practice time.

07:21.790 --> 07:23.290
Nothing but two-on-two matches?

07:23.290 --> 07:24.670
That's rough!

07:24.670 --> 07:29.260
Since they're used to playing in teams of two, 
they don't expect anyone to get the ball for them,

07:29.260 --> 07:33.010
and all of them are constantly
 setting up some sort of attack.

07:33.010 --> 07:33.470
Cover for me!

07:33.470 --> 07:34.220
Leave it to me!

07:36.310 --> 07:38.560
Idiots! Watch where you're going!

07:38.560 --> 07:40.810
Which is probably why that sort of thing happens.

07:40.810 --> 07:42.980
They're all really annoying.

07:42.980 --> 07:46.360
People from other schools think you guys are annoying too.

07:46.360 --> 07:46.900
Huh?!

07:47.860 --> 07:48.610
Tanaka!

07:49.820 --> 07:50.720
Whoa!

07:50.720 --> 07:51.780
Nice one, Jiri!

07:52.240 --> 07:56.370
<i>Right now, Jouzenji has two attackers in the front row, not counting their setter.</i>

07:56.370 --> 07:58.240
<i>The other possibility is a back row attack.</i>

07:56.660 --> 07:58.240
Let me spike too!

07:59.700 --> 08:02.160
<i>Isn't he the setter? Who's going to set, then?</i>

08:05.360 --> 08:07.170
<i>Someone from the back row is going to set?</i>

08:09.340 --> 08:10.300
What?!

08:10.300 --> 08:15.510
<b>Simple and Strong</b>

08:10.300 --> 08:15.510
<b>Simple and Strong</b>

08:12.920 --> 08:14.510
Heave ho!

08:15.510 --> 08:17.470
Heave ho!

08:15.510 --> 08:17.470
Karasuno                        Jouzenji

08:15.510 --> 08:17.470
Karasuno                        Jouzenji

08:17.470 --> 08:22.710
Despite the circumstances, 
I must say how they play is quite fun to watch.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.230
I can't argue with that.

08:24.230 --> 08:28.650
However, we can keep up with them in
 terms of attacking with reckless abandon.

08:29.750 --> 08:31.440
Let's have some fun and play.

08:33.110 --> 08:36.200
They go all-out and play around.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.600
In a match...

08:37.600 --> 08:38.120
Huh?

08:38.410 --> 08:41.160
"To truly have fun, you need to be good."

08:41.790 --> 08:44.750
Apparently, the former Coach Ukai said that a lot.

08:45.380 --> 08:48.710
I didn't quite understand what 
the meaning of "have fun" was.

08:48.710 --> 08:50.090
All right!

08:51.300 --> 08:55.260
But watching Jouzenji, 
I'm wondering if this is what he meant.

08:56.270 --> 08:58.970
Being good enough... to have fun.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.260
Nice receive!

08:58.970 --> 09:03.700
It might be because they're up against Karasuno, but they're playing around even more than usual.

09:03.700 --> 09:06.440
Yes. When they're in the groove, they do play well.

09:08.810 --> 09:09.610
Sorry! Sorry!

09:09.610 --> 09:11.400
And that happens as soon as I compliment them.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.070
Karasuno                        Jouzenji

09:11.400 --> 09:13.070
Karasuno                        Jouzenji

09:14.530 --> 09:17.320
That little guy sure can jump!

09:14.950 --> 09:15.950
Good job getting a hand on it!

09:15.950 --> 09:17.320
Let's score off this!

09:17.320 --> 09:17.990
Not to mention...

09:22.540 --> 09:23.950
All right!

09:24.620 --> 09:27.320
He's got such a stern face,

09:27.320 --> 09:31.340
but that setter sure comes up with some crazy attacks!

09:31.340 --> 09:34.300
Karasuno                        Jouzenji

09:31.340 --> 09:34.300
Karasuno                        Jouzenji

09:31.640 --> 09:32.840
Nice receive!

09:33.550 --> 09:34.300
Asahi!

09:37.470 --> 09:39.050
Nice, Tsucchi!

09:37.890 --> 09:39.050
<i>Who's gonna spike it?</i>

09:40.050 --> 09:41.140
<i>A setter dump?!</i>

09:41.140 --> 09:42.140
<i>I have to stop it!</i>

That... wasn't a block...

09:54.530 --> 09:55.950

Karasuno                        Jouzenji

10:13.110 --> 10:14.030
Time!

10:14.920 --> 10:17.040
Kageyama, don't die!

10:17.040 --> 10:18.300
He's not dying.

10:18.300 --> 10:20.890
Hey, we're switching you out 
until your nose stops bleeding.

10:20.890 --> 10:22.810
My nose isn't bleeding!

10:22.810 --> 10:24.850
Yes, it is. Why would even you lie about that?

10:25.810 --> 10:26.520
Are your eyes okay?

10:26.520 --> 10:27.560
They're fine.

10:28.190 --> 10:32.510
Did he get caught up in the excitement of the other team?

10:32.510 --> 10:35.030
Well, this is a good opportunity to cool your head off.

10:35.690 --> 10:39.030
You can't go back out until your nose stops bleeding,
 so go get yourself looked over.

10:39.950 --> 10:41.410
Just in case!

10:41.410 --> 10:42.870
Come on. Let's go.

10:42.870 --> 10:44.360
Hey, Kageyama!

10:44.360 --> 10:45.950
I'll handle things while you're gone.

10:45.950 --> 10:49.170
Yep. Leave it all to your upperclassmen.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.630
Give us a good serve, Tsukishima!

10:59.130 --> 11:00.510
Huh? Karasuno is...

11:02.690 --> 11:04.560
Why are they subbing number ten out?

11:04.560 --> 11:07.080
He seems to be doing fine.

11:07.080 --> 11:10.350
I think they're going to use this opportunity to try other things.

11:10.350 --> 11:11.400
Besides,

11:11.980 --> 11:15.320
the other guys seem to be better at the fundamentals.

11:17.280 --> 11:20.200
What? Isn't that the truth?

11:20.200 --> 11:26.580
Aone developed a strange friendship with
 Karasuno's number ten during the interhigh prelims.

11:26.580 --> 11:29.210
It may be like that for now.

11:29.210 --> 11:32.370
<i>Huh? Aone spoke!</i>

11:32.370 --> 11:35.590
And their number ten is aware of it.

11:36.630 --> 11:37.630
Hinata.

11:41.380 --> 11:46.930
For the past few months, Narita's spent quite a 
lot of time practicing with Sugawara as his setter.

11:46.930 --> 11:50.310
Well, just watch your upperclassmen play from outside the court for a bit.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.060
Yessir.

11:51.060 --> 11:53.030
Let's stop them here!

11:53.650 --> 11:55.940
You got this, Narita!

11:54.900 --> 11:56.730
Calm down a little.

11:56.730 --> 11:58.480
We know you want to be in there.

11:58.480 --> 12:01.240
I wanna play, and I wanna practice.

12:02.570 --> 12:04.780
I have a lot to do.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.250
All right!

12:08.040 --> 12:09.390
Nice spike!

12:10.250 --> 12:12.160
That's it! Just like that!

12:10.250 --> 12:12.160
Nice job!

12:12.160 --> 12:12.750
Right.

12:12.750 --> 12:14.670
Karasuno                        Jouzenji

12:12.750 --> 12:14.670
Karasuno                        Jouzenji

12:14.670 --> 12:15.830
Give us a good one, Terushima!

12:15.830 --> 12:16.380
All right!

12:21.970 --> 12:24.800
Whoo! A service ace! Whoo!

12:25.220 --> 12:29.770
That guy acts like he just scored three points!
 It seriously pisses me off!

12:29.770 --> 12:32.060
You're one to talk.

12:32.060 --> 12:33.630
What?!

12:34.800 --> 12:36.520
Don't let their excitement overwhelm you.

12:37.150 --> 12:39.280
We're gonna take the first set!

12:40.030 --> 12:41.150
Shake it off!

12:41.150 --> 12:42.780
Get one through!

12:44.030 --> 12:45.660
Oh, Kageyama's back.

12:46.460 --> 12:48.450
Kageyama was all right.

12:48.450 --> 12:50.870
Yeah, looks that way. Thanks for checking up on him.

12:51.620 --> 12:52.660
You okay?

12:51.620 --> 12:54.330
But I guess they're not going to swap him back in yet.

12:52.660 --> 12:53.620
Yes.

12:54.330 --> 12:55.330
Nishinoya!

12:55.330 --> 12:56.560
Got it!

12:56.560 --> 12:57.880
Nice receive!

12:57.880 --> 13:00.400
I guess you lost a handle on things.

13:01.190 --> 13:02.300
Shut up!

13:02.720 --> 13:05.050
I'll be able to get a handle on things soon!

13:05.050 --> 13:06.270
That's the plan!

13:10.190 --> 13:12.680
Nice spike!

13:11.720 --> 13:12.680
Nice!

13:13.770 --> 13:15.330
We're not gonna lose.

13:15.730 --> 13:17.690
Karasuno                        Jouzenji

13:15.730 --> 13:17.690
Karasuno                        Jouzenji

13:17.690 --> 13:18.860
We have a chance here!

13:20.100 --> 13:20.860
Got it!

13:22.480 --> 13:25.240
<i>Synchronized attack: Sugawara version!</i>

13:28.700 --> 13:30.450

13:31.660 --> 13:32.870

13:32.870 --> 13:37.080
That thing where everyone starts
 moving all at once looks awesome!

13:37.080 --> 13:39.000
Hey, so, like...

13:41.060 --> 13:43.760
Don't tell me they're thinking about...

13:44.130 --> 13:45.970
Give us another good serve, Narita!

13:49.580 --> 13:52.190
Jouzenji's also doing a synchronized attack?!

13:53.810 --> 13:55.060
All right!

14:02.900 --> 14:05.110
Karasuno                        Jouzenji

14:05.110 --> 14:08.160
We used to do that a lot.

14:05.900 --> 14:07.700
Not bad, Narita.

14:08.160 --> 14:09.820
We still do sometimes.

14:10.490 --> 14:16.580
Jouzenji's synchronized attack just now was 
probably them copying what they saw on the fly.

14:16.580 --> 14:18.460
Huh? When they were losing?

14:18.460 --> 14:20.540
Not to mention, we were on set point.

14:21.060 --> 14:24.050
A part of it may be because it was only the first set.

14:21.060 --> 14:24.050
I totally thought we could do it!

14:24.590 --> 14:26.970
It's scary how reckless they are.

14:28.510 --> 14:30.380
This has been bothering me.

14:30.380 --> 14:36.560

15:01.040 --> 15:04.320
That number ten sure can jump.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.050

Fly

I'm going to rebuild this team from the ground up.

15:39.500 --> 15:42.540
First, you'll get better at playing two-on-two.

15:46.210 --> 15:49.300

16:46.560 --> 16:48.610

No matter how often we tell you to calm down,

17:36.240 --> 17:39.530

17:39.870 --> 17:41.030
because you'd get too excited.

17:42.950 --> 17:45.290
I'm no good at flashy moves,

17:46.120 --> 17:48.000

19:38.110 --> 19:40.240

What'll you do then?

20:40.680 --> 20:41.840
Even then,

20:41.840 --> 20:43.340
I'll do my best to have fun!

20:44.260 --> 20:47.050
You're going to have fun when you're losing or playing poorly?

20:47.050 --> 20:50.220
Anyone who thinks that way is a creep or a weirdo!

20:51.930 --> 20:54.690
M-Misaki? Is something wrong?

20:54.690 --> 20:56.150
I'm sorry, Coach.

20:56.730 --> 21:02.360
They'll never become painfully aware of their weaknesses unless I say this right now,

21:02.360 --> 21:03.860
so please let me tell them.

21:04.320 --> 21:06.380
Huh? Uh, okay...

21:06.380 --> 21:10.790
Okudake told me to give these guys a good spanking.

21:10.790 --> 21:11.680
Spanking?

21:11.680 --> 21:13.040
Hana...

21:13.040 --> 21:14.580
...just said "spanking"!

21:15.570 --> 21:18.880
Yeah, the situation right now isn't fun.

21:19.750 --> 21:23.260
I hate to say it, but those guys are 
playing a lot more freely than we are.

21:25.100 --> 21:30.180
Okudake always used to say that to play, 
you first need a playground.

21:31.360 --> 21:34.020
Bear with the times that aren't fun,

21:34.020 --> 21:36.690
and play the match out to the very end.

21:39.570 --> 21:42.940
<i>I'm pretty sure I just heard the
 pretty girl over there say "spank."</i>

21:42.940 --> 21:44.070
What's wrong?

21:44.070 --> 21:45.330
Kiyoko...

21:46.880 --> 21:51.120
I'm not sure why I'm asking, but would you scold us too?

21:51.120 --> 21:52.450
Also, please do it in the most condesc—

21:52.450 --> 21:53.660
No.

21:53.660 --> 21:54.200
Then will you—

21:54.200 --> 21:55.800
I won't spank you, either.

21:57.040 --> 22:00.630
<i>We got "spank" to flow from Kiyoko's luscious lips!</i>

22:00.630 --> 22:02.590
Jouzenji                        Karasuno

22:00.630 --> 22:02.590
Jouzenji                        Karasuno

22:05.840 --> 22:07.550
We're halfway through the second set.

22:09.330 --> 22:12.350
This is where "round two" begins, huh?

22:14.980 --> 22:14.980
{ED}

22:27.200 --> 22:31.330
When I was just a nobody, something lit up my eyes

22:31.330 --> 22:37.130
I was merely a guy languishing complacently in the dark, happy with what I had

22:31.330 --> 22:37.130
I was merely a guy languishing complacently in the dark, happy with what I had

22:37.130 --> 22:41.550
Now I'm torn toward the heavens even on a starless night

22:41.550 --> 22:46.600
Whether our time comes to us or not is a matter for those in another world

22:46.630 --> 22:56.810
That's right, our lungs pumping and our hearts beating is all we have in this new realm

22:46.630 --> 22:56.810
That's right, our lungs pumping and our hearts beating is all we have in this new realm

22:56.810 --> 23:01.940
We've always been dancing on an unlit stage, but now beyond that

23:01.940 --> 23:08.740
We're awaiting the rising of a sun that none have yet witnessed

23:08.740 --> 23:14.660
Now that we're deliberating at a crossroads, paths blurring together

23:08.740 --> 23:14.660
Now that we're deliberating at a crossroads, paths blurring together

23:15.210 --> 23:17.290
We can feel it

23:15.210 --> 23:17.290
We can feel it

23:17.290 --> 23:22.420
Inside this uncharted world which has yet to take on a name

23:22.420 --> 23:28.670
As I'm waiting for the dawn to reach my eyes with a familiar light

23:28.670 --> 23:35.600
I'm reminded of days I won't return to, and seeking proof of newfound existence

23:35.600 --> 23:38.440
We brace ourselves

23:45.070 --> 23:45.070
{Preview}

23:46.070 --> 23:48.900
<i>Jouzenji's style of volleyball is always changing.</i>

23:48.900 --> 23:50.490
<i>So is ours!</i>

23:50.490 --> 23:53.450
<i>Rolling... Headbutt!</i>

23:53.450 --> 23:54.660
<i>You're so cool, Noya!</i>

23:54.970 --> 23:56.910
<i>That's... not volleyball.</i>
