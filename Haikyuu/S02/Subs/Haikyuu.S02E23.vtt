<b>Rule the Court</b>

00:02.940 --> 00:06.380
I'm sure you're sick of hearing this, 
but make sure your serves are strong.

00:07.160 --> 00:10.720
We can't do anything about 
number ten scoring some points.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.140
Force him to one side and then dig it out.

00:12.140 --> 00:13.240
Yes, sir!

00:15.980 --> 00:18.990
You guys are good.

00:18.990 --> 00:20.670
Yeah!

00:25.450 --> 00:29.460
Don't let Oikawa do whatever he wants with his serves!

00:29.460 --> 00:30.920
I don't care how high you get the ball!

00:30.920 --> 00:32.520
Just dig out his serves!

00:32.520 --> 00:34.880
When you do, someone else will keep the rally going!

00:34.880 --> 00:35.720
Yes, sir!

00:36.130 --> 00:39.970
If an enemy you must defeat
 one day is called an archenemy,

00:40.390 --> 00:44.030
then for us, Aoba Jousai is precisely that.

00:44.030 --> 00:46.200
The stage has been set.

00:47.070 --> 00:51.070
The victor in this battle against 
our archenemy will be you guys!

00:51.070 --> 00:52.110
Yessir!

00:53.500 --> 00:54.630
In the final set,

00:55.580 --> 00:58.200
we're going to surpass Aoba Jousai!

00:58.860 --> 01:01.330
We'll surpass them with this team!

01:03.430 --> 01:06.000
Karasuno, fight!

01:06.000 --> 01:08.680
Yeah!

01:16.380 --> 01:20.600

Leap and fly! High!

02:08.020 --> 02:12.700
Let your wings, glistening with blood, sweat, and tears

02:12.700 --> 02:15.320
Take you to wherever you need to go

02:15.320 --> 02:18.110
Unleash your unrefined impulses

02:18.110 --> 02:21.120
Uncover your instincts and bare your uncut fangs

02:21.120 --> 02:22.990
It may take an arduous path

02:22.990 --> 02:25.200
But be torn down it endlessly to achieve your dream

02:25.200 --> 02:28.210
So just fly

Fly high

This is finally it.

02:42.710 --> 02:43.680
Yeah.

02:43.680 --> 02:46.640
They'll finally settle things with Seijou in this set.

02:48.390 --> 02:49.650
Give us a good serve!

02:49.650 --> 02:51.320
Go, Asahi!

02:58.160 --> 02:59.650
All right!

03:02.730 --> 03:04.620
Give us a good one, Oikawa!

03:05.160 --> 03:06.360
<i>Get it up.</i>

03:06.360 --> 03:07.930
<i>You have to get the ball up no matter what.</i>

03:09.380 --> 03:12.290
<i>We can't let them get ahead early.</i>

03:12.590 --> 03:15.170
<i>We have to stop them here!</i>

03:18.930 --> 03:21.970
Olé!

03:23.730 --> 03:25.630
<i>It's so fast.</i>

03:24.670 --> 03:27.050
It's going over the net! Watch for the return spike!

03:25.630 --> 03:27.960
<i>I couldn't react even though he hit it right at me!</i>

03:28.390 --> 03:30.030
Just spike it, Kyoutani!

03:33.100 --> 03:34.510
All right!

03:36.780 --> 03:40.780
<i>Good. Mad Dog's engine is still warm.</i>

03:41.150 --> 03:44.760
Oikawa's serves are definitely a problem.

03:44.760 --> 03:46.950
C'mon, you have to stop him.

03:46.950 --> 03:48.490
Keep fighting, guys!

03:48.490 --> 03:50.930
Give us another good serve, Oikawa!

03:53.310 --> 03:56.170
Olé!

03:58.420 --> 03:59.800
All right!

03:59.800 --> 04:02.010
It's up!

04:02.010 --> 04:03.150
Cover it!

04:07.970 --> 04:10.680
Yeah!

04:11.120 --> 04:12.710
Nice spike, Tanaka!

04:12.110 --> 04:13.770
They somehow managed to stop Oikawa.

04:12.710 --> 04:13.770
Thanks!

04:13.770 --> 04:16.400
Well done, Ryuu!

04:19.610 --> 04:20.550
All right!

04:20.550 --> 04:22.430
Tsukishima! You're serving next!

04:22.430 --> 04:23.670
Oh, right.

04:25.530 --> 04:28.530
Aoba Jousai                  Karasuno

04:25.530 --> 04:28.530
Aoba Jousai                  Karasuno

04:25.830 --> 04:27.870
Give us a good serve, Tsukishima!

04:31.470 --> 04:32.580
Got it!

04:33.260 --> 04:34.290
Mad Dog!

04:38.930 --> 04:40.330
Yeah!

04:41.440 --> 04:42.800
Nice spike!

04:42.800 --> 04:47.050
Kyoutani has a lot more energy when he's in the front row.

04:47.550 --> 04:50.740
Hopefully he'll be able to keep it up until the end.

04:54.080 --> 04:56.700
<i>Their ace has both power and technique.</i>

04:56.700 --> 05:00.990
<i>They also have number sixteen, 
who's an annoying decoy on top of his offensive prowess.</i>

05:01.640 --> 05:04.970
<i>And then there's Oikawa, who's starting to land his serves.</i>

05:06.140 --> 05:09.530
<i>If we can't counter those three, we're done for!</i>

05:10.160 --> 05:12.590
<i>Both of us are talented.</i>

05:12.590 --> 05:17.790
<i>The more we struggle for dominance,
 the more fatal the consequences will be...</i>

05:18.590 --> 05:20.290
<i>...when one of us loses our balance.</i>

05:21.440 --> 05:23.030
<i>Hang on and don't let go!</i>

05:25.880 --> 05:27.920
All right!

05:25.880 --> 05:29.970
Aoba Jousai                      Karasuno

05:25.880 --> 05:29.970
Aoba Jousai                      Karasuno

05:27.920 --> 05:29.970
The last set is really close too.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.950
But neither team has taken a significant lead yet.

05:33.950 --> 05:37.060
This is where they have to fight really hard to not fall ever further behind.

05:38.090 --> 05:40.330
Asahi! Get this one!

05:49.000 --> 05:50.410
Yeah!

05:50.410 --> 05:51.320
N—

05:51.320 --> 05:53.620
Nice aim!

05:54.710 --> 05:56.760
There was no way you could've gotten that one.

05:56.760 --> 05:57.830
Just get the next one!

05:57.830 --> 06:00.540
Aoba Jousai                   Karasuno

05:57.830 --> 06:00.540
Aoba Jousai                   Karasuno

05:58.440 --> 06:01.540
Do it again, Asahi!

06:05.670 --> 06:06.240
Yes!

06:06.240 --> 06:06.800
Nice receive!

06:11.990 --> 06:13.160
Yeah!

06:13.160 --> 06:14.350
Damn it...

06:14.930 --> 06:16.710
Here he comes again.

06:15.570 --> 06:17.360
Give us a good one, Oikawa!

06:25.270 --> 06:28.070
Olé!

06:30.280 --> 06:31.370
<i>Yes!</i>

06:30.960 --> 06:32.670
Here's our chance! Tanaka!

06:31.370 --> 06:33.990
<i>Now score here and stop Oikawa from serving!</i>

06:34.370 --> 06:35.420
Okay!

06:35.420 --> 06:36.950
Watch the fast attack!

06:37.870 --> 06:38.410
Nice receive!

06:39.920 --> 06:41.630
Finish it, Kyoutani!

06:41.630 --> 06:43.340
Watch the right!

06:43.650 --> 06:44.450
Tanaka.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.640
Shut down!

06:53.940 --> 06:56.100
Yes! They did it!

06:53.940 --> 06:54.930
Yes!

06:56.100 --> 06:57.790
Nice block!

06:56.410 --> 06:59.660
Tsukki and Tanaka switched places just now.

06:59.660 --> 07:00.440
Yeah.

07:00.740 --> 07:02.870
Did they predict that a straight spike was coming?

07:03.560 --> 07:05.060
Great job, Tsukishima!

07:05.060 --> 07:05.950
I knew it.

07:07.110 --> 07:10.490
Tanaka's been getting into it 
with number sixteen, hasn't he?

07:11.880 --> 07:13.530
You mean like pick a fight with the guy?

07:13.950 --> 07:14.830
Like in the second set,

07:15.250 --> 07:17.600
he kept trying to do a wipe off of number sixteen's block.

07:18.290 --> 07:23.840
Or when there wasn't anyone blocking a cross-court spike, he hit a straight spike that barely got past number sixteen.

07:23.840 --> 07:26.770
Seriously? I didn't notice!

07:26.770 --> 07:31.630
It looks like number sixteen is fighting back 
and hitting straight spikes to where Tanaka is.

07:31.630 --> 07:34.800
I think Tsukishima also figured that out.

07:38.480 --> 07:40.850
You predicted him so well, Tsukishima!

07:40.850 --> 07:42.370
How'd you come up with that?

07:42.370 --> 07:43.810
It was nothing.

07:45.580 --> 07:47.630
<i>This is a chance to take the momentum.</i>

07:48.280 --> 07:49.650
<i>Don't let it go to waste!</i>

07:50.700 --> 07:51.710
Got it!

07:52.530 --> 07:53.970
Nice receive.

{=2}Karasuno

08:11.880 --> 08:14.340
Keep it up!

08:12.460 --> 08:14.340
Yeah!

08:14.920 --> 08:18.500
Looks like we pushed the right buttons for number sixteen.

08:20.640 --> 08:23.760
Don't tell me Ryuu did that on purpose!

08:23.760 --> 08:24.840
No.

08:24.840 --> 08:29.110
He may've been challenging him, but that wasn't his goal.

08:29.590 --> 08:32.820
That's just his nature.

08:36.200 --> 08:40.910
And I guess Tsukishima was able to take advantage of said nature.

08:41.860 --> 08:45.130
<i>Seijou seemed as solid as a rock, 
but now we're starting to see some cracks.</i>

08:46.510 --> 08:48.600
<i>This is our chance to bring them down!</i>

08:49.210 --> 08:50.710
Let's keep the pressure on!

08:51.440 --> 08:53.190
Yeah!

09:12.750 --> 09:14.820
Who's that? A high school kid?

09:15.750 --> 09:17.820
He said he just wants to practice with us.

09:17.820 --> 09:21.430
I saw him with a different club on Saturday.

09:21.430 --> 09:23.660
If he's in high school, what about his school's team?

09:23.940 --> 09:26.960
He's probably the type that doesn't get along with the rest of the team.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.750
Is he going through his rebellious stage?

09:28.750 --> 09:31.380
I'm surprised he's playing a team sport.

09:31.670 --> 09:35.200
I'm sure he's playing because
 there's something he likes about it.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.010
Oh, Kiyoshi.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.140
Hi.

09:38.140 --> 09:41.350
Otherwise, he wouldn't come 
all the way out here to practice.

09:45.810 --> 09:55.070
Japan! Japan! Japan! Japan!

10:11.340 --> 10:15.840
W-Well, we're always short on people, 
so it's probably fine.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.880
Not to mention, he's better than us.

10:17.880 --> 10:18.510
What?!

10:18.930 --> 10:20.470
I could take him!

10:20.470 --> 10:22.230
Someone's mad.

10:22.230 --> 10:23.310
Shut up.

10:27.640 --> 10:30.400
Give us another good serve, Tsukishima!

10:32.940 --> 10:33.900
Got it!

10:33.900 --> 10:35.610
Mad Dog!

10:38.390 --> 10:40.030
All right!

10:40.030 --> 10:43.240
Aoba Jousai                  Karasuno

10:40.030 --> 10:43.240
Aoba Jousai                  Karasuno

10:40.750 --> 10:43.240
The timeout didn't help, did it?

10:43.240 --> 10:45.160
Maybe this is his limit.

10:45.160 --> 10:49.370
Seijou's got plenty of players, 
so why don't they switch him out?

10:51.040 --> 10:51.920
Switch gears!

10:51.920 --> 10:52.920
Just focus—

10:54.420 --> 10:56.910
Go scold him, Iwa!

11:09.310 --> 11:13.230
You need to calm down if you 
want to go back out on the court.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.880
Pull yourself together already.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.620
We've got our backs to the wall here.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.250
Like I care. Shut up.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.380
All right!

11:30.380 --> 11:33.040
Yahaba, don't push him too much.

11:35.790 --> 11:38.710
Sorry, but no.

11:39.990 --> 11:43.910
You fell for our opponent's taunts, 
got pissed off, and then self-destructed.

11:43.910 --> 11:45.220
Talk about lame.

11:46.060 --> 11:47.010
What?

11:48.390 --> 11:53.600
You had the nerve to come back,
 and then you got to play right away.

11:54.480 --> 11:57.230
Some guys have a problem with that.

11:57.940 --> 11:59.030
Me, for example.

12:01.040 --> 12:01.820
But...

12:04.110 --> 12:06.410
It's not like he caused any problems,

12:06.780 --> 12:09.750
so I guess it doesn't matter as long as we can use him in matches.

12:09.750 --> 12:12.700
Will he be able to keep up in practice?

12:12.700 --> 12:14.310
He'll have blanks to fill.

12:14.310 --> 12:16.670
Communication is one of those.

12:18.420 --> 12:19.090
Well...

12:21.550 --> 12:24.800
Those aren't the movements of someone who hasn't been practicing.

12:28.470 --> 12:33.440
I thought it was pretty cold-hearted to both you and us.

12:33.850 --> 12:36.440
But that's not the problem.

12:34.230 --> 12:35.060
Left!

12:36.440 --> 12:39.940
The players we need in order to win are chosen as regulars.

12:37.520 --> 12:38.050
I touched it!

12:38.050 --> 12:38.770
Someone cover it!

12:38.770 --> 12:39.940
Got it!

12:40.950 --> 12:42.900
And you were one of the chosen.

12:45.110 --> 12:47.070
So do your job right.

12:48.240 --> 12:51.290
I think Yahaba's gonna get bitten.

12:51.290 --> 12:52.540
Hope he's okay.

12:52.540 --> 12:54.140
Go stop him.

12:54.140 --> 12:54.790
No way!

12:57.020 --> 12:59.170
Well, that's all just a facade.

13:04.590 --> 13:07.140
If you ruin this for our upperclassmen,

13:07.830 --> 13:09.930
I'll never forgive you!

13:16.520 --> 13:20.190
I thought you were more shallow than that.

13:21.070 --> 13:23.360
You're not wrong there.

13:23.360 --> 13:25.950
I may be shallow, but I respect our upperclassmen.

13:27.070 --> 13:31.410
As long as you're on the court, 
any point won or lost belongs to the team.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.750
So come on.

13:33.750 --> 13:35.290
Help us win.

13:36.270 --> 13:37.220
Got it!

13:37.220 --> 13:38.330
Center!

13:40.590 --> 13:41.050
Kunimi!

13:42.500 --> 13:46.180
<i>Kunimi's attack might be...</i>

13:46.630 --> 13:47.470
<i>a tip!</i>

13:49.970 --> 13:51.010
Ryuu!

13:54.730 --> 13:56.730
All right!

13:54.730 --> 13:57.690
Aoba Jousai                Karasuno

13:54.730 --> 13:57.690
Aoba Jousai                Karasuno

13:56.730 --> 13:57.690
Nice spike!

13:58.010 --> 13:59.910
I'm amazed you saw that coming, Kageyama.

13:59.910 --> 14:00.650
Thanks.

14:06.530 --> 14:08.700
Huh? He's already back.

14:09.370 --> 14:10.820
He's going back in?

14:10.820 --> 14:11.740
That was quick.

14:11.740 --> 14:14.580
I'm sure it's a gamble for Seijou, though.

14:17.830 --> 14:19.210
All right!

14:20.500 --> 14:21.750
Let it go!

14:22.720 --> 14:24.840
All right!

14:24.840 --> 14:26.510
S-Shake it off...

14:27.670 --> 14:31.640
Nagamushi Jr. High               South Third Jr. High

14:27.670 --> 14:31.640
Nagamushi Jr. High               South Third Jr. High

14:28.700 --> 14:30.640
He's not doing well today.

14:30.640 --> 14:31.640
What should we do?

14:31.640 --> 14:35.270
We don't have any better attackers than him.

14:35.270 --> 14:38.850
But if his condition gets any worse, we're in for a boatload of trouble.

14:38.850 --> 14:41.860
Let's just see how things go.

14:46.110 --> 14:48.280
Give us a good serve, Tanaka!

14:49.260 --> 14:50.410
Okay.

14:50.410 --> 14:51.870
Nice receive!

14:52.520 --> 14:53.330
Mad Dog!

14:58.460 --> 15:00.460
Oikawa's a total sadist.

15:00.790 --> 15:04.420
<i>They have absolute trust in each other, no questions asked.</i>

15:09.180 --> 15:13.550
It's been a while since you started coming here, 
lone wolf high school kid.

15:15.070 --> 15:18.020
I heard you go to Aoba Jousai.

15:18.020 --> 15:19.850
Aren't they pretty good?

15:19.850 --> 15:22.060
I applied there but couldn't get in.

15:24.940 --> 15:29.970
You're running away from your team 
and practicing elsewhere without rest.

15:29.970 --> 15:32.360
Sure are taking the easy way out, huh?

15:32.360 --> 15:33.370
What?

15:33.660 --> 15:42.120
A team is reliable, annoying at times, 
and powerful allies, yet they cause a lot of stress.

15:43.240 --> 15:47.300
You really think you're actually playing volleyball even though you can't face that head-on?

15:56.790 --> 16:00.640
<i>You need to face your team, 
and your team needs to face you.</i>

16:01.600 --> 16:05.810
<i>If you can do that, you may butt heads, but you'll both improve as a result.</i>

16:05.810 --> 16:07.440
All right!

16:07.440 --> 16:12.030
<i>And if you ever manage that, just know that you're lucky.</i>

16:14.320 --> 16:17.620
<i>A team like that is hard to find.</i>

16:18.540 --> 16:19.860
All right!

16:19.860 --> 16:21.500
Looks like a great team.

16:22.500 --> 16:23.760
Yeah!

16:23.760 --> 16:25.380
Make sure you face them head-on.

16:25.380 --> 16:26.480
Sorry!

16:26.480 --> 16:27.500
I'll get the next one!

16:27.500 --> 16:28.590
Yeah!

16:28.590 --> 16:31.050
Aoba Jousai                   Karasuno

16:28.590 --> 16:31.050
Aoba Jousai                   Karasuno

16:29.230 --> 16:31.050
Kyoutani, you're serving next.

16:34.470 --> 16:36.090
That was a nice spike.

16:43.960 --> 16:44.900
Thanks.

16:47.110 --> 16:50.030
If number sixteen were on our team,

16:51.120 --> 16:54.610
I wonder what I'd do in this situation.

16:55.320 --> 17:01.040
Oikawa is amazing and terrifying at the same time.

16:58.950 --> 17:00.660
All right, let's score here!

17:01.040 --> 17:02.580
Yeah!

17:02.580 --> 17:10.550
With that play, it appears as though the oddball 
number sixteen now fits in with the rest of the team.

17:11.230 --> 17:12.480
That can't be good.

17:12.480 --> 17:14.510
We haven't lost

17:14.980 --> 17:16.930
when it comes to our strength as a team.

17:16.930 --> 17:18.470
This is just the start!

17:21.470 --> 17:22.430
Yeah.

17:23.060 --> 17:24.890
Give us a good serve, Kyoutani!

17:29.360 --> 17:30.230
Ryuu!

17:30.820 --> 17:31.470
Yeah!

17:31.470 --> 17:32.530
Nice receive!

17:35.610 --> 17:36.700
Nice one, Watacchi!

17:36.700 --> 17:37.820
Watch the counterattack!

17:38.950 --> 17:40.530
All right!

17:40.530 --> 17:41.620
Damn it.

17:41.620 --> 17:44.580
Aoba Jousai                  Karasuno

17:41.620 --> 17:44.580
Aoba Jousai                  Karasuno

17:41.930 --> 17:42.950
They're tied!

17:42.950 --> 17:44.580
Seijou caught up!

17:45.580 --> 17:47.540
Do it again, Kyoutani!

17:50.800 --> 17:52.250
All right!

17:58.050 --> 17:59.380
Here's our chance!

17:59.380 --> 18:01.180
Hit it, Asahi!

18:03.770 --> 18:05.890
Damn it... Sorry!

18:04.120 --> 18:05.890
All right!

18:08.690 --> 18:10.330
You're awesome, Asahi!

18:10.330 --> 18:11.690
You totally blew them away!

18:11.690 --> 18:12.960
Thanks!

18:12.960 --> 18:14.940
So who's the upperclassman here?

18:16.400 --> 18:23.080
They can dig out Hinata's spike if they predict
 what he's going to do or force him to one side.

18:23.080 --> 18:23.870
Yeah.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.830
<i>I have to use Hinata better.</i>

18:30.500 --> 18:32.250
All right!

18:31.290 --> 18:33.250
Karasuno                  Aoba Jousai

18:31.290 --> 18:33.250
Karasuno                  Aoba Jousai

18:35.590 --> 18:37.420
Ugh, again?

18:39.150 --> 18:43.600
I feel like my lifespan gets shorter
 every time Oikawa goes up to serve.

18:39.560 --> 18:41.550
Give us another good serve, Oikawa!

18:42.390 --> 18:44.180
Oikawa, we're counting on you!

18:45.560 --> 18:47.770
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

18:47.770 --> 18:50.650
I'm sure we all do.

18:50.650 --> 18:53.040
<i>We're almost at the end of the set.</i>

18:53.040 --> 18:55.440
<i>Giving up a lot of points right now would be fatal.</i>

18:56.070 --> 18:57.490
<i>You have to stop him here!</i>

18:58.110 --> 18:59.320
Bring it!

18:59.910 --> 19:02.820
Olé!

19:03.530 --> 19:04.990
Daichi!

19:06.370 --> 19:08.460
I can't believe he got that.

19:08.460 --> 19:10.090
We have a chance here!

19:10.090 --> 19:10.920
Damn it!

19:11.320 --> 19:12.630
Watch for the fast attack!

19:13.670 --> 19:14.840
<i>Kindaichi!</i>

19:18.070 --> 19:19.510
It's fine.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.890
If you have a request, say it!

19:22.590 --> 19:27.220
<i>Oikawa improves things if I say something, but if I hesitate, nothing gets across to him!</i>

19:27.650 --> 19:29.340
Hey, Oikawa.

19:29.340 --> 19:33.150
That one is a bit hard to sync up with, or, like...

19:35.470 --> 19:36.230
Got it.

19:37.150 --> 19:39.740
But try again without changing anything.

19:40.260 --> 19:41.320
<i>Again!</i>

19:42.220 --> 19:43.740
<i>For you, the point of impact...</i>

19:44.370 --> 19:47.540
<i>needs to be about a ball's length closer!</i>

19:50.250 --> 19:52.500
Yes!

19:52.500 --> 19:54.440
<i>That was a really sharp broad jump.</i>

19:54.440 --> 19:57.670
<i>Kindaichi's movements have changed since the interhigh.</i>

19:57.670 --> 19:59.750
Shake it off! We'll stop them here!

19:59.750 --> 20:01.130
Concentrate on getting one point!

20:01.130 --> 20:04.850
Karasuno                Aoba Jousai

20:01.130 --> 20:04.850
Karasuno                Aoba Jousai

20:01.480 --> 20:02.350
Two in a row!

20:02.350 --> 20:04.850
Seijou's turning it around in the second half of the set!

20:06.120 --> 20:10.090
It's now an all-out war between the teams.

20:10.090 --> 20:11.020
Indeed.

20:11.680 --> 20:16.310
The person who brings up the Aoba Jousai team as a whole

20:16.610 --> 20:19.280
is Oikawa, right?

20:16.880 --> 20:19.280
Give us another good one, Oikawa!

20:20.240 --> 20:22.900
Yeah, I know, sir.

20:23.950 --> 20:27.240
But this isn't even close to the total strength of our team!

20:24.910 --> 20:26.240
Bring it!

20:26.240 --> 20:27.240
Come on!

20:28.200 --> 20:29.800
Give us another good serve, Oikawa!

20:29.800 --> 20:32.710
Olé!

20:33.660 --> 20:34.620
Sorry!

20:34.620 --> 20:35.370
Get it, Tsukishima!

20:35.370 --> 20:36.880
Push it over, Kindaichi!

20:41.830 --> 20:43.380
All right!

20:43.380 --> 20:44.530
Thanks, Tsukishima!

20:44.530 --> 20:46.140
Tsukishima, you're serving next!

20:46.140 --> 20:47.890
Go wild out there, Shouyou!

20:47.890 --> 20:49.100
Right!

20:49.100 --> 20:50.730
We'll stop them at one point!

20:50.730 --> 20:52.270
Yeah!

20:53.100 --> 20:55.490
The Great King really is amazing.

20:55.490 --> 20:56.940
Do you truly understand that?

20:57.470 --> 20:59.320
I can tell there's something amazing about him.

21:02.390 --> 21:03.610
However!

21:05.650 --> 21:08.350
As long as I'm around, you're invincible!

21:12.370 --> 21:14.040
That was cool, you know?

21:14.830 --> 21:16.540
Seriously...

21:18.000 --> 21:20.780
They keep digging out your spikes, so I don't know what you mean.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.480
What'd you say?!

21:22.480 --> 21:25.010
Baseless courage is good!

21:25.810 --> 21:28.140
M-My courage isn't baseless!

21:32.730 --> 21:34.020
All right!

21:34.020 --> 21:35.270
Nice receive!

21:35.270 --> 21:36.480
Mad Dog!

21:39.100 --> 21:41.230
Nice contact!

21:41.650 --> 21:42.650
Got it!

21:45.240 --> 21:49.620
Give it to me!

21:50.580 --> 21:51.870
<i>I jumped too far forward!</i>

21:51.870 --> 21:53.290
<i>The net's really close!</i>

21:59.200 --> 22:01.340
<i>Isn't the set a bit close to the net?!</i>

22:01.340 --> 22:03.550
<i>It's basically right on top of it!</i>

22:03.550 --> 22:04.800
No one's there!

22:05.340 --> 22:06.800
Slam it down!

22:05.690 --> 22:06.800
Up front!

22:14.980 --> 22:14.980
{ED}

22:27.200 --> 22:31.330
When I was just a nobody, something lit up my eyes

22:31.330 --> 22:37.130
I was merely a guy languishing complacently in the dark, happy with what I had

22:31.330 --> 22:37.130
I was merely a guy languishing complacently in the dark, happy with what I had

22:37.130 --> 22:41.550
Now I'm torn toward the heavens even on a starless night

22:41.550 --> 22:46.600
Whether our time comes to us or not is a matter for those in another world

22:46.630 --> 22:56.810
That's right, our lungs pumping and our hearts beating is all we have in this new realm

22:46.630 --> 22:56.810
That's right, our lungs pumping and our hearts beating is all we have in this new realm

22:56.810 --> 23:01.940
We've always been dancing on an unlit stage, but now beyond that

23:01.940 --> 23:08.740
We're awaiting the rising of a sun that none have yet witnessed

23:08.740 --> 23:14.660
Now that we're deliberating at a crossroads, paths blurring together

23:08.740 --> 23:14.660
Now that we're deliberating at a crossroads, paths blurring together

23:15.210 --> 23:17.290
We can feel it

23:15.210 --> 23:17.290
We can feel it

23:17.290 --> 23:22.420
Inside this uncharted world which has yet to take on a name

23:22.420 --> 23:28.680
As I'm waiting for the dawn to reach my eyes with a familiar light

23:28.680 --> 23:35.600
I'm reminded of days I won't return to, and seeking proof of newfound existence

23:35.600 --> 23:38.440
We brace ourselves

23:45.030 --> 23:45.030
{Preview}

23:45.770 --> 23:48.820
<i>It's finally the third set, and the score is 17-16.</i>

23:49.110 --> 23:49.860
<i>It's the final stretch.</i>

23:50.150 --> 23:50.820
<i>Yeah.</i>

23:50.820 --> 23:51.660
<i>We're definitely gonna win.</i>

23:51.660 --> 23:51.950
<i>Yeah.</i>

23:52.230 --> 23:54.530
<i>Give all the sets to me!</i>
