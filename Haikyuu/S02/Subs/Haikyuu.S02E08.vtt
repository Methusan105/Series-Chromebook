00:10.490 --> 00:12.530
Your face is so freckly, Tadashi!

00:13.170 --> 00:16.240
Why are you so wimpy?

00:17.410 --> 00:19.700
You need to train your body,

00:19.700 --> 00:21.480
so you're in charge of carrying the bags!

00:25.210 --> 00:26.790
Seriously? You're crying?

00:26.790 --> 00:29.380
He cries over everything!

00:30.210 --> 00:32.090
Crybaby!

00:37.140 --> 00:38.550
Whatcha lookin' at?

00:38.550 --> 00:40.220
Hey, isn't he a sixth grader?

00:40.560 --> 00:42.980
No, he's in class 3.

00:44.940 --> 00:46.190
That's so lame.

00:49.980 --> 00:50.940
What'd you mean by that?!

00:51.530 --> 00:52.440
Come back here!

00:54.950 --> 00:55.780
What?

00:58.200 --> 01:00.740
Y-You're lame, Four-eyes!

01:00.740 --> 01:02.790
Idiot, idiot, idiot!

01:02.790 --> 01:04.830
H-Hold on a second!

01:06.000 --> 01:07.080
<i>"Lame."</i>

01:07.830 --> 01:12.260
<i>Tsukki might've actually been talking about me too when he said that.</i>

01:13.720 --> 01:15.220
<i>But what mattered more</i>

01:15.630 --> 01:20.670
<i>was how he could stand up to the bullies who kept messing with me by himself.</i>

01:20.670 --> 01:23.270
<i>I was envious of how cool he seemed.</i>

01:23.980 --> 01:26.190
<i>I wanted to be like that.</i>

01:27.770 --> 01:28.940
What about you, Yamaguchi?

01:28.940 --> 01:31.980
What would you say to Tsukishima?

01:38.030 --> 01:38.030

01:47.040 --> 01:51.930
I keep running as I run out of breath

If I come to a standstill

02:06.900 --> 02:11.610
People ask me why I find joy in this

02:11.610 --> 02:16.190
But I don't understand it myself

02:16.660 --> 02:21.070
Running is the only thing on my mind

02:21.070 --> 02:25.250
Even if nothing goes right in the future

02:25.250 --> 02:30.880
I won't stop trying to find the best version of myself

02:30.880 --> 02:35.180
Even if someone tells me that this is as far as I go

02:35.180 --> 02:37.260
And draws the line on me

02:37.260 --> 02:41.200
I'll say no, thank you, and surge on ahead

02:41.850 --> 02:42.690
So what?

02:42.690 --> 02:44.310
Whatever the future may bring

02:44.310 --> 02:45.020
So what?

02:45.020 --> 02:46.810
However people are supposed to act

02:46.810 --> 02:47.550
So what?

02:47.550 --> 02:51.250
It doesn't really matter

02:53.230 --> 02:56.180

Okay.

03:14.840 --> 03:15.800
Good work!

03:15.800 --> 03:17.340
Hey, Tsukishima!

03:17.340 --> 03:21.050
We're gonna practice the synchronized attack, so stick around and help us out for a bit!

03:22.400 --> 03:24.010
I can still go too.

03:24.740 --> 03:27.310
There'll be three wing spikers, but that's fine, right?

03:27.920 --> 03:29.890
I wanna get the timing down.

03:31.100 --> 03:33.560
Wait... You aren't trying to make the roster, are you?

03:34.480 --> 03:37.530
Don't think I'm gonna be warming that bench forever.

03:38.380 --> 03:40.070
Bring it on!

03:40.070 --> 03:41.990
Daichi, let's hurry up and do this.

03:41.990 --> 03:43.680
Let me rest for a bit, man.

03:43.680 --> 03:44.660
Good job!

03:43.680 --> 03:45.320
Daichi!

03:45.320 --> 03:48.200
I can't afford to take this lightly!

Wow! It's Tsukishima again!

04:06.680 --> 04:08.600
That's why he's the ace!

04:08.600 --> 04:09.140
Hey!

04:08.600 --> 04:09.600

04:21.440 --> 04:22.820
Karasuno.

04:22.820 --> 04:26.030
They're a powerhouse school that can 
compete with the likes of Shiratorizawa.

04:26.850 --> 04:29.450
I'm gonna make it to nationals for sure!

04:40.740 --> 04:42.130
I'm home.

04:43.930 --> 04:44.680
Welcome back!

04:45.050 --> 04:46.680
You stayed late for personal practice again?

04:46.680 --> 04:50.060
Everyone's really good, so I can't just sit around.

04:50.060 --> 04:52.480
Not to mention, Coach Ukai is really strict.

04:52.480 --> 04:53.640
But...

04:53.640 --> 04:56.150
I'm aiming to make the roster as a first-year!

04:56.150 --> 04:58.060
There are tons of people on the team, right?

04:58.060 --> 04:59.900
It'd be awesome if you could make the roster.

04:59.900 --> 05:00.610
Right?

05:01.880 --> 05:02.780
Mom!

05:02.780 --> 05:03.780
Welcome home.

05:03.780 --> 05:05.740
Make me three lunches again tomorrow!

05:05.740 --> 05:08.030
One for morning practice, one for lunch, and one for before team practice!

05:08.030 --> 05:10.830
Got it. High in protein and low in fat, right?

05:10.830 --> 05:12.880
Yep! Thanks!

05:18.710 --> 05:23.860
Today, the butcher lady said, "Your big brother is 
on the Karasuno volleyball team? That's incredible!"

05:26.130 --> 05:27.840
You have a match tomorrow, right?

05:27.840 --> 05:29.470
Can I come watch?

05:30.870 --> 05:32.890
I'll get nervous if you watch, so nope!

05:32.890 --> 05:34.730
Aw...

05:36.150 --> 05:38.480
Hey, what position do you play now?

05:38.480 --> 05:39.980
The same as junior high?

05:39.980 --> 05:40.770
Yeah.

05:40.770 --> 05:41.820
So you're the ace!

05:46.330 --> 05:47.360
Yep!

05:48.920 --> 05:50.370
What about you, Kei?

05:50.370 --> 05:52.790
You just joined a youth team, right?

05:53.410 --> 05:55.330
I hate receiving.

05:55.840 --> 05:58.790
When you're just starting out,
 the ball doesn't go where you want, does it?

05:59.220 --> 06:00.420
Here, get into position.

06:01.830 --> 06:02.590
Here we go.

06:07.150 --> 06:09.930
Kei, don't try to push it up with your arms.

06:10.390 --> 06:14.600
More like this. Lower your hips, 
and send it out with your entire body.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.050
Try tossing it to me.

06:21.980 --> 06:23.110
Wow!

06:23.110 --> 06:25.530
Receiving is where it all begins in volleyball.

06:25.530 --> 06:27.360
Everything is about keeping the ball in play.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.570
Are you getting along with the other kids?

06:30.490 --> 06:31.450
Yeah...

06:31.450 --> 06:32.370
Liar!

06:32.660 --> 06:34.830
It's written all over your face!

06:44.710 --> 06:45.970
Hello.

06:47.100 --> 06:48.970
U-Um...

06:50.070 --> 06:51.800
Thank you for the other day.

06:53.470 --> 06:54.680
Have we met?

06:56.470 --> 07:03.110
The... other day... a-at the park... The park...

07:00.560 --> 07:03.110
Oh. So, what are you doing here?

07:03.730 --> 07:05.390
Oh, um...

07:06.130 --> 07:08.600
Well, I wanted to play some sport too...

07:08.600 --> 07:11.570
There are a lot of scary guys in baseball and soccer,

07:11.570 --> 07:13.710
but this seemed safe.

07:16.490 --> 07:18.910
Those shoes are awesome!

07:18.910 --> 07:21.500
I still only have the school-issued gym shoes.

07:21.810 --> 07:23.670
They're hand-me-downs.

07:23.670 --> 07:26.300
I'm using my brother's until I get new ones next week.

07:26.300 --> 07:28.210
Your brother plays volleyball too?

07:28.940 --> 07:32.120
He plays at a real powerhouse high school called Karasuno.

07:32.120 --> 07:35.330
He's like the ace.

07:35.330 --> 07:37.600
Th-The ace of a powerhouse?!

07:37.600 --> 07:39.680
Th-That's so awesome!

07:39.680 --> 07:42.690
N-Not really. It's not that big of a deal.

07:42.690 --> 07:44.230
He was the ace in junior high too.

07:44.230 --> 07:45.400
Wow!

07:45.990 --> 07:47.320
How long has he been playing?

07:47.320 --> 07:48.570
Did he play on this team?

07:48.570 --> 07:51.110
Aces are so cool!

07:53.250 --> 07:54.570
I'm home.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.040
Did your practice match today go well?

07:58.400 --> 07:59.950
Yeah, it went great!

07:59.950 --> 08:01.250
I scored a ton!

08:01.900 --> 08:03.760
That's cool.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.750
Let's practice passing.

08:07.750 --> 08:09.160
After we're done eating.

08:13.660 --> 08:14.720
Yamaguchi.

08:13.980 --> 08:15.340
What's the next class?

08:15.340 --> 08:16.430
Japanese!

08:16.070 --> 08:19.310
I'm gonna go to Karasuno's match tomorrow. Do you wanna come too?

08:16.430 --> 08:18.170
What, it's Japanese?

08:20.120 --> 08:22.770
My brother keeps telling me not 
to come because he gets nervous,

08:22.770 --> 08:26.980
but since my brother's a third-year, 
this will be the last match he plays in the prefecture.

08:26.980 --> 08:28.000
I'll go!

08:28.000 --> 08:30.530
I've never seen Akiteru play.

08:30.530 --> 08:33.320
Tsukishima, your brother's on 
Karasuno's volleyball team too?

08:33.320 --> 08:34.740
So is mine.

08:35.070 --> 08:37.120
What position does your brother play?

08:37.120 --> 08:38.410
Wing spiker.

08:38.410 --> 08:40.310
Hey! So does mine.

08:40.310 --> 08:43.210
They have a deep roster, so it's always really tough.

08:43.210 --> 08:47.290
If you can't even play in matches, you really have to wonder if going to a powerhouse school is worth it.

08:48.450 --> 08:50.880
Tsukki's brother plays in the matches.

08:51.360 --> 08:52.630
What? No way.

08:53.210 --> 08:58.430
I saw a match recently, 
and no one named Tsukishima was on the roster.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.890
That's impossible.

09:02.890 --> 09:05.310
I hear about the matches all the time.

09:05.310 --> 09:06.730
You're probably just mistaken.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.980
You can see for yourself at the match.

09:09.980 --> 09:11.980
Yeah, I can.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.800
They're going left! Left!

09:39.660 --> 09:40.550
Yes!

09:40.550 --> 09:43.350
That's awesome! Number ten did it again!

09:43.350 --> 09:45.810
He's barely 170 cm too!

09:45.810 --> 09:47.690
And he's still a second-year, right?

09:48.060 --> 09:48.650
See?

09:49.030 --> 09:51.010
Their left wing spiker is Kawada, a third-year,

09:51.010 --> 09:54.940
and they have another one who's a second-year called the Little Giant!

09:54.940 --> 09:56.650
That's how it's been for a year now!

09:56.650 --> 09:58.360
We get it already!

10:00.460 --> 10:02.330
We can see that...

10:03.500 --> 10:07.720
My brother's also a third-year who 
hasn't gotten to play in any matches.

10:12.590 --> 10:13.800
<i>Slice.</i>

10:15.260 --> 10:20.090
<i>It wasn't like a TV show or movie, 
where there are spurts of blood and heads go flying.</i>

10:20.090 --> 10:22.850
<i>This was far more shocking.</i>

10:23.550 --> 10:25.810
<i>My brother wasn't on the court.</i>

10:25.810 --> 10:27.310
One more!

10:27.310 --> 10:28.480
Give us a good serve!

10:42.070 --> 10:43.450
<i>How lame.</i>

10:54.120 --> 10:56.560
<i>It was just a high school club,</i>

10:56.560 --> 10:59.820
<i>but for me, that team and volleyball felt like they were everything my brother stood for.</i>

11:00.820 --> 11:03.300
<i>In the end, it made him tell pointless lies.</i>

11:04.220 --> 11:05.560
So you're the ace!

11:06.260 --> 11:07.180
Yep!

11:08.280 --> 11:11.580
<i>But he was probably trying to believe in it himself.</i>

11:12.310 --> 11:14.110
<i>That if he tried hard enough, it would come true.</i>

11:15.560 --> 11:17.280
<i>But so what if it did?</i>

11:17.800 --> 11:20.450
<i>Would it be worth the struggle?</i>

11:24.400 --> 11:27.690
Tsukki!

11:31.470 --> 11:32.210
What?

11:33.570 --> 11:38.340
You've always handled everything in a cool and smart way.

11:39.130 --> 11:42.110
I was always jealous of you.

11:43.460 --> 11:44.350
And?

11:48.100 --> 11:50.430
But lately, you're just lame!

11:52.080 --> 11:55.110
So what if Hinata might become the Little Giant some day?

11:55.540 --> 11:59.190
That only means you have to beat him, Tsukki!

11:59.190 --> 12:03.450
You should prove with your skill
 that you're better than Hinata is!

12:04.280 --> 12:07.200
You have the height, brains, and instinct,

12:07.200 --> 12:10.410
so why did you decide that improving is impossible?!

12:15.950 --> 12:22.800
Even if I worked really hard and became the best 
player on the team, what would happen after that?

12:23.920 --> 12:28.180
Even if we somehow made it to nationals, 
what comes next?

12:29.070 --> 12:31.460
There's always someone better.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.600
Even if you're able to show some results somewhere,

12:33.930 --> 12:36.060
you'll never actually be number one!

12:36.060 --> 12:37.610
You're gonna lose eventually!

12:38.020 --> 12:42.200
Everyone knows that, so how can they keep going?!

12:53.540 --> 12:58.110
What the hell do you need besides your own pride?!

13:11.420 --> 13:15.270
I never imagined this day would come.

13:24.300 --> 13:26.910
When the hell did you get so cool?

13:27.780 --> 13:29.530
You're really cool.

13:30.370 --> 13:33.120
T-Tsukki? What's wrong?

13:31.260 --> 13:35.660
<i>At the very least, it's better than my worn-out train of thought.</i>

13:36.430 --> 13:38.540
But I'm not convinced by that.

13:38.540 --> 13:39.290
Huh?

13:40.420 --> 13:41.500
I'm gonna go ask something.

13:42.600 --> 13:43.460
Tsukki?!

13:47.080 --> 13:48.510
You know, Daichi...

13:48.800 --> 13:49.550
Yeah?

13:49.550 --> 13:51.990
You sure it's okay to leave Tsukishima alone?

13:51.990 --> 13:55.420
If we force him to do it, it won't be personal training.

13:55.420 --> 13:56.980
I know that, but...

13:58.750 --> 14:03.730
Ever since that very first three-on-three, I've never been that worried about him.

14:05.970 --> 14:09.920
Though, if Tsukishima starts saying that he wants to quit, 
then I'll panic and try to stop him.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.790
If that happens, I'm trusting you to come help, okay?

14:13.180 --> 14:15.830
I don't know what's going on inside his head.

14:16.330 --> 14:21.750
But we're still growing as a team,
 and we don't know the limits of our skill.

14:22.400 --> 14:27.820
Even if we were to start pressing up against that limit, 
we couldn't help but aim for the very top.

14:27.820 --> 14:30.130
Even though there was no rhyme or reason, we'd keep going.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.380
Indeed.

14:38.230 --> 14:44.980

14:38.230 --> 14:44.980

14:51.990 --> 14:54.450
First Gymnasium

14:56.620 --> 15:01.540
Yamaguchi said something in a weird voice as he ran off. I wonder if he's okay.

15:01.540 --> 15:02.990
Weird voice?

15:02.990 --> 15:05.900
"Tsukki!" Like that.

15:05.900 --> 15:08.540
Oh, so he went to see Tsukishima.

15:08.540 --> 15:09.800
Did something happen?

15:10.130 --> 15:13.220
Yeah. He seemed kinda worried about Tsukishima.

15:13.220 --> 15:14.260
I see.

15:14.600 --> 15:18.350
Tsukishima never does anything that's lame.

15:18.350 --> 15:20.290
He never fails at tests.

15:20.290 --> 15:22.230
He always does things like, "whoosh"!

15:22.230 --> 15:23.440
And "swish"!

15:23.440 --> 15:24.310
Yeah...

15:24.310 --> 15:27.230
<i>What exactly is the difference
 between "whoosh" and "swish"?</i>

15:27.230 --> 15:29.610
So I think he'll be okay.

15:30.300 --> 15:34.880
It's obvious that being good at volleyball is way cooler than sucking at it!

15:33.740 --> 15:36.660
Third Gymnasium

15:33.740 --> 15:36.660
Third Gymnasium

15:37.730 --> 15:38.870
Oh?

15:39.210 --> 15:40.660
What's this?

15:40.660 --> 15:42.420
What do we have here?

15:43.560 --> 15:46.170
There's something I'd like to ask you. May I?

15:46.170 --> 15:47.800
Sure!

15:49.260 --> 15:51.680
Thank you very much.

15:52.410 --> 15:55.510
Both of your schools are occasionally considered powerhouses, right?

15:55.510 --> 15:56.920
I guess, yeah.

15:56.920 --> 16:01.350
Even if you were able to make it to nationals,
 actually winning there would be difficult, right?

16:01.350 --> 16:03.150
But not impossible!

16:03.150 --> 16:04.920
Now, now, let's hear him out.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.340
This is just a hypothetical.

16:07.290 --> 16:09.890
I'm genuinely curious about this.

16:09.890 --> 16:12.070
Why do you try so hard?

16:12.740 --> 16:16.070
Volleyball is just a club, and maybe you'll get to write,

16:16.070 --> 16:20.430
"I worked really hard in my high school club,"
 on your resume, right?

16:21.520 --> 16:23.460
"Merely a club"?

16:24.780 --> 16:26.920
That almost sounds like someone's name.

16:26.920 --> 16:29.880
Oh, like "Merliah Clubb"?

16:30.390 --> 16:32.720
No, wait. You heard him wrong! He said "just a club"!

16:32.720 --> 16:33.970
Aw man!

16:33.970 --> 16:37.680
So it doesn't sound like someone's name. Man, I was so close! Damn it!

16:36.890 --> 16:39.520
Man, it's no good.

16:37.680 --> 16:39.520
Should I say something here?

16:39.520 --> 16:41.350
What about Justa Clubb?

16:39.520 --> 16:41.350
Nah. There'll be no end to it.

16:41.350 --> 16:43.600
Say, Specky.

16:43.600 --> 16:44.840
It's Tsukishima.

16:44.840 --> 16:46.100
Say, Tsukishima!

16:46.700 --> 16:48.150
Is volleyball fun?

16:51.050 --> 16:52.610
No, not really...

16:52.610 --> 16:55.160
Maybe that's because you suck at it?

16:56.620 --> 16:59.720
I'm a third-year, and I've been to nationals.

16:59.720 --> 17:02.330
I'm better than you. Way better than you!

17:02.330 --> 17:04.080
You don't have to tell me that.

17:04.410 --> 17:08.420
But I only recently started thinking that volleyball was fun.

17:09.840 --> 17:14.220
Ever since my straight spike became usable in matches, I've found it fun.

17:11.800 --> 17:18.760
<b>Straight</b>

17:11.800 --> 17:18.760
<b>Straight</b>

17:14.840 --> 17:18.760
I've always been good at landing cross-court shots, 
but blockers started stopping it.

17:15.300 --> 17:18.760
<b>Cross</b>

17:15.300 --> 17:18.760
<b>Cross</b>

17:19.300 --> 17:22.810
I got frustrated and practiced the hell out of straight spikes.

17:22.810 --> 17:23.730
And then...

17:24.380 --> 17:31.260
at the next tournament, I didn't let the same blockers touch the ball at all. I hit it right past them.

17:33.630 --> 17:38.310
Just that one spike made me feel like my time to shine had finally come.

17:45.960 --> 17:48.880
It's all about whether or not you have a moment like that.

17:50.180 --> 17:54.720
What happens in the future,
 if you can win the next match...

17:54.720 --> 17:56.550
None of that matters.

17:57.180 --> 18:05.230
Crushing the guy in front of you and the 
exhilaration of giving 120% are everything.

18:08.810 --> 18:11.690
Well, that's what's it's like for me.

18:11.690 --> 18:15.030
It might not fit for anyone and everyone.

18:15.030 --> 18:20.410
I don't really understand why you say it's
 "just a club," but I don't think you're wrong.

18:20.810 --> 18:24.790
But if you ever experience that moment,

18:25.660 --> 18:29.790
that's when you'll be hooked on volleyball.

18:33.840 --> 18:34.590
Okay.

18:34.940 --> 18:37.740
I answered your question. Now, help with blocking.

18:37.740 --> 18:40.030
Now, now. Hurry, hurry.

18:39.010 --> 18:40.590
Wait, um... Hold on...

18:43.820 --> 18:46.180
Oh, Yamaguchi came back.

18:46.600 --> 18:49.100
Yamaguchi, where's Tsukishima?

18:47.140 --> 18:48.100
One more!

18:48.100 --> 18:49.100
Let's go!

18:49.100 --> 18:52.430
It looks like he got caught by the 
Nekoma and Fukurodani captains.

18:52.430 --> 18:54.650
What?! I'm so jealous.

18:54.940 --> 18:56.780
Maybe I'll go too.

18:57.570 --> 19:01.070
Hinata, do you think of Tsukki as your rival?

19:01.070 --> 19:02.070
Huh?

19:02.070 --> 19:03.580
Of course I do!

19:04.110 --> 19:07.500
We play the same position, 
and he has everything I'm lacking!

19:08.440 --> 19:09.960
But I'm not gonna lose to him!

19:10.670 --> 19:12.290
I've gotta practice!

19:13.130 --> 19:15.020
Captain! I'm joining in!

19:15.020 --> 19:19.510
If Hinata and Tsukishima are rivals, it's like the sun versus the moon.

19:15.020 --> 19:16.090
Sure.

19:20.640 --> 19:23.550
"Sun" from "Hi" and "Moon" from "Tsuki."

19:24.400 --> 19:26.560
Yeah, you're right!

19:29.600 --> 19:30.520
Yeah!

19:30.520 --> 19:32.190
I hope that happens.

19:39.740 --> 19:40.240
Number four!

19:41.950 --> 19:43.370
Eek...

19:41.950 --> 19:43.370
All right!

19:43.370 --> 19:46.200
That number four is really intense again today.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.200
Sir.

19:47.660 --> 19:50.120
Fukurodani                 Karasuno

19:47.660 --> 19:50.120
Fukurodani                 Karasuno

19:48.650 --> 19:50.120
All right!

19:50.570 --> 19:54.380
Even if you're not able to stop number four's spikes, 
at least try to touch the ball.

19:54.380 --> 19:55.340
Right!

19:55.630 --> 19:56.750
I see.

19:56.750 --> 20:01.340
Even if they aren't able to stop it, 
if it hits their hand, the ball loses momentum?

20:01.340 --> 20:02.590
Right.

20:02.590 --> 20:05.640
There are fundamentally two ways of blocking.

20:06.050 --> 20:10.190
There's the soft block that's used in order to make the ball easier to receive,

20:10.810 --> 20:14.600
and the kill block that's used to completely shut the ball out.

20:14.910 --> 20:17.900
Kill? As in, killing something?

20:17.900 --> 20:18.570
Yes.

20:18.570 --> 20:19.570
Eek!

20:20.330 --> 20:22.070
We don't have to stop it?

20:27.380 --> 20:28.610
No.

20:28.610 --> 20:31.790
If you're able to actually shut the ball out,
 that'd be perfect.

20:35.390 --> 20:37.130
All right!

20:35.630 --> 20:36.500
Fukurodani                 Karasuno

20:35.630 --> 20:36.500
Fukurodani                 Karasuno

20:36.500 --> 20:36.630
Fukurodani                 Karasuno

20:36.500 --> 20:36.630
Fukurodani                 Karasuno

20:36.630 --> 20:36.750
Fukurodani                 Karasuno

20:36.630 --> 20:36.750
Fukurodani                 Karasuno

20:36.750 --> 20:36.880
Fukurodani                 Karasuno

20:36.750 --> 20:36.880
Fukurodani                 Karasuno

20:36.880 --> 20:37.000
Fukurodani                 Karasuno

20:36.880 --> 20:37.000
Fukurodani                 Karasuno

20:37.000 --> 20:37.130
Fukurodani                 Karasuno

20:37.000 --> 20:37.130
Fukurodani                 Karasuno

20:37.130 --> 20:37.340
Fukurodani                 Karasuno

20:37.130 --> 20:37.340
Fukurodani                 Karasuno

20:37.340 --> 20:37.460
Fukurodani                 Karasuno

20:37.340 --> 20:37.460
Fukurodani                 Karasuno

20:37.460 --> 20:37.840
Fukurodani                 Karasuno

20:37.460 --> 20:37.840
Fukurodani                 Karasuno

20:38.660 --> 20:40.010
Nice receive!

20:40.010 --> 20:41.300
Give it to me!

20:41.670 --> 20:43.510
Left! Number four!

20:44.500 --> 20:46.220
Start by thinking about what you need to do.

20:46.620 --> 20:51.220
Focus your strength in your fingertips so
 that they won't be blown away by the ball.

20:51.570 --> 20:54.560
And put your hands in front of you, not over your head.

20:54.560 --> 20:55.650
In front.

20:55.970 --> 20:58.770
After that, make this annoying owl shut up!

20:58.770 --> 21:00.480
Just you try!

21:01.600 --> 21:07.530
<i>Um... a soft block that reduces the ball's momentum, and...</i>

21:08.090 --> 21:11.040
<i>The kind which completely kills the momentum...</i>

21:18.590 --> 21:20.460
He tipped it!

21:20.460 --> 21:21.420
Damn it!

21:21.420 --> 21:25.970
Wow, I thought he was definitely 
going to hit it as hard as he could!

21:25.970 --> 21:28.220
But it was actually a diversion.

21:28.220 --> 21:31.020
He truly is a nationals-caliber ace.

21:32.850 --> 21:35.350
Daichi, did you see that?

21:35.350 --> 21:36.350
Yeah.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.980
Bokuto, you fled from the competition.

21:40.440 --> 21:43.070
I didn't flee! I avoided the competition!

21:43.070 --> 21:45.320
I skillfully avoided the block!

21:45.320 --> 21:46.110
You got caught off guard.

21:46.110 --> 21:47.440
Oh, fine!

21:47.440 --> 21:49.460
Yeah, yeah, sorry about that!

21:53.700 --> 21:56.430
Well, now...

22:00.580 --> 22:04.760
Perhaps the troublesome baby bird is starting to come out of his shell.

22:10.370 --> 22:11.100
Oh...

22:12.060 --> 22:14.350
<i>The sun versus the moon?</i>

22:14.980 --> 22:14.980
{ED}

22:27.950 --> 22:33.520
We climb the mountain in our way

22:34.040 --> 22:40.080
Losing more than just time in the process

22:40.080 --> 22:46.090
Tasting freedom makes us want to fly

22:46.220 --> 22:52.160
And notice the feelings welling up inside

22:52.430 --> 22:55.560
It's almost in our reach

22:55.560 --> 22:58.640
The closer we get, the more it shines

22:58.640 --> 23:01.440
And stretches out in front of our eyes

23:01.440 --> 23:04.810
That panorama created just for us

23:04.810 --> 23:11.070
Until I reach the top and come back down, my lungs will keep breathing

23:11.070 --> 23:17.340
But now I've been possessed by the desire to climb that summit once again

23:17.340 --> 23:23.190
We cast aside all our doubt and set flight to the skies

23:23.190 --> 23:30.350
Our flailing hands reach out and grab hold of the moment

23:31.710 --> 23:33.350
That special moment

23:34.820 --> 23:39.330
Come to us climbers

23:39.880 --> 23:42.070
Come to us right now

23:45.030 --> 23:45.030
{Preview}

23:45.640 --> 23:47.300
<i>Come block some balls for us, Tsukki!</i>

23:47.300 --> 23:49.350
<i>Could you please not call me that?</i>

23:49.350 --> 23:51.320
<i>Then... how about Specky?</i>

23:51.860 --> 23:54.620
<i>All right, let's do this thing, Akaasshi!</i>

23:55.040 --> 23:57.080
<i>Somehow, I got roped into all of this...</i>

23:55.990 --> 24:00.040
Episode Nine: 
Vs. "Umbrella"

23:55.990 --> 24:00.040
Episode Nine: 
Vs. "Umbrella"

23:57.080 --> 23:58.040
<i>Next time on </i>Haikyuu!!<i>:</i>

23:58.040 --> 23:59.350
<i>"Vs. 'Umbrella.'"</i>
