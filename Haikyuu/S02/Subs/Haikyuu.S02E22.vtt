Karasuno                   Waku South

00:01.480 --> 00:05.990
Karasuno                   Waku South

00:10.200 --> 00:11.030
Sorry.

00:11.820 --> 00:13.450
I'm gonna go to the bathroom,

00:14.120 --> 00:15.950
so go on ahead without me.

00:17.460 --> 00:20.290
He's really pumped about going to the bathroom.

00:20.290 --> 00:21.460
He must need to shit.

00:21.460 --> 00:24.380
Say "poop"! You're so vulgar, Kageyama!

00:24.380 --> 00:25.210
Shit.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.340
I don't think he's actually going to the bathroom.

00:25.210 --> 00:26.090
Poop.

00:26.090 --> 00:26.920
Shit.

00:26.920 --> 00:27.720
Poop.

00:27.720 --> 00:28.340
Shit.

00:28.340 --> 00:29.180
Poop!

00:30.890 --> 00:31.890
Mr. Ukai.

00:33.260 --> 00:35.470
I'm sorry for wasting my chance.

00:36.770 --> 00:41.440
"What determines whether you can win or not is how aggressive you can be when serving."

00:42.190 --> 00:48.700
Hearing you point that out after the Fukurodani match 
and really thinking about it made me understand my role.

00:49.490 --> 00:52.820
And then I thought I wanted to be able to play too.

00:54.620 --> 00:57.750
But when push came to shove, I ran away.

01:02.000 --> 01:02.830
Please.

01:04.290 --> 01:06.000
<i>Give me one more chance!</i>

01:08.380 --> 01:09.800
Stop bugging me.

01:09.800 --> 01:10.880
I already know.

01:20.890 --> 01:22.560
<i>Please put me in there!</i>

01:23.940 --> 01:23.940

01:24.360 --> 01:27.360
Leap and fly! High!

01:27.360 --> 01:30.400
Flecked with blood, sweat, and tears

01:30.400 --> 01:34.620
Those glistening wings can let you leave it all behind

01:34.620 --> 01:37.790
So just fly

02:01.180 --> 02:05.310
They just want to see the ends of the ocean

02:05.730 --> 02:10.320
Empty your mind

02:10.320 --> 02:15.910
Let the headwinds guide your approach

02:15.910 --> 02:18.030
And with a hop, step, and a jump

02:18.910 --> 02:22.040
Leap and fly! High!

02:22.040 --> 02:26.710
Let your wings, glistening with blood, sweat, and tears

02:26.710 --> 02:29.340
Take you to wherever you need to go

02:29.340 --> 02:32.130
Unleash your unrefined impulses

02:32.130 --> 02:35.130
Uncover your instincts and bare your uncut fangs

02:35.130 --> 02:37.010
It may take an arduous path

02:37.010 --> 02:39.220
But be torn down it endlessly to achieve your dream

02:39.220 --> 02:42.230
So just fly

02:44.440 --> 02:47.400
Fly high

02:47.400 --> 02:50.530
Into the distant future

02:54.030 --> 02:54.030
{Part A}

02:54.820 --> 02:57.120
Go land another one, Kyoutani!

03:03.870 --> 03:04.580
Sorry!

03:04.580 --> 03:05.160
It went long!

03:10.550 --> 03:13.510
Aoba Jousai                 Karasuno

03:10.550 --> 03:13.510
Aoba Jousai                 Karasuno

03:11.090 --> 03:12.170
This isn't good.

03:12.170 --> 03:15.380
Seijou's number sixteen is finding his groove.

03:15.380 --> 03:17.010
They're up by five...

03:17.010 --> 03:19.220
Don't give up!

03:19.510 --> 03:21.060
Let's move back a bit.

03:21.060 --> 03:23.520
I don't think he'll hit one up front.

03:23.520 --> 03:24.430
Yeah.

03:24.430 --> 03:25.180
Right.

03:26.270 --> 03:27.560
Give us a good serve!

03:26.270 --> 03:29.190
<i>Bring it, bring it, bring it!</i>

03:30.610 --> 03:31.820
Tanaka!

03:31.820 --> 03:32.940
Yeah!

03:36.780 --> 03:38.360
Yeah!

03:38.360 --> 03:41.080
This is just the beginning!

03:38.360 --> 03:41.080
Aoba Jousai                 Karasuno

03:38.360 --> 03:41.080
Aoba Jousai                 Karasuno

03:42.580 --> 03:44.200
Give us a good one, Shouyou!

03:44.790 --> 03:46.750
Hey! That guy...

03:50.000 --> 03:52.750
Pardon me. We're making a substitution.

03:56.220 --> 03:59.010
Hey, it's the scaredy-cat pinch server.

03:59.010 --> 04:02.430
Oh, it's the guy who played in the Waku South match too.

04:02.430 --> 04:05.100
Though I totally understand why he's a scaredy-cat.

04:05.100 --> 04:08.140
I'd hate having to serve when the match is on the line.

04:08.140 --> 04:11.400
That's the guy who was all stiff
 from nerves and screwed up, right?

04:11.400 --> 04:12.820
Think he'll be okay?

04:12.820 --> 04:13.980
Yeah...

04:13.980 --> 04:16.360
Yamaguchi, go score ten points!

04:16.360 --> 04:18.450
That'd end the match...

04:19.200 --> 04:20.160
It's fine.

04:23.620 --> 04:26.160
G-Give it to 'em good, Yamaguchi!

04:26.160 --> 04:29.080
Y-You gotta keep... keep your cool!

04:29.080 --> 04:30.250
Give us a good serve!

04:30.250 --> 04:31.330
Give us a good serve.

04:31.830 --> 04:33.290
Give it your all!

04:33.290 --> 04:34.170
Right!

04:35.170 --> 04:36.920
Three, two, one...

04:37.550 --> 04:40.300
Give us a good serve, Yamaguchi!

04:45.010 --> 04:46.390
<i>Eight seconds.</i>

04:47.520 --> 04:52.650
You know there's that much time after 
the whistle blows for you to serve, right?

04:52.650 --> 04:53.650
Yes.

04:53.650 --> 04:58.150
Almost every time, you get surprised by the whistle and immediately toss the ball up to serve.

05:00.990 --> 05:02.620
You don't need to panic.

05:03.370 --> 05:04.330
Right.

05:04.330 --> 05:06.240
And, well, you know...

05:07.040 --> 05:09.080
You went to talk to Ukai, right?

05:10.080 --> 05:11.040
Yes.

05:11.710 --> 05:13.080
You chose to do that.

05:14.500 --> 05:20.090
So now you're already a completely different player.

05:21.130 --> 05:25.220
Go out there and do what you want to do.

05:34.020 --> 05:37.940
Look at them getting all serious now.

06:04.840 --> 06:05.720
Let it go!

06:21.440 --> 06:24.160
All right!

06:24.160 --> 06:26.120
All...

06:26.120 --> 06:28.330
...right!

06:28.330 --> 06:29.540
He did it.

06:29.540 --> 06:31.450
Tadashi!

06:30.080 --> 06:31.450
Nice serve!

06:31.450 --> 06:33.460
It stayed in!

06:34.920 --> 06:36.210
We're...

06:36.210 --> 06:37.880
...supposed to be...

06:37.880 --> 06:39.460
...cheering for Aoba Jousai.

06:39.460 --> 06:42.010
Wait, what? Isn't that a bit of an overreaction?

06:39.460 --> 06:41.420
Nice serve, Yamaguchi!

06:42.010 --> 06:43.670
They only scored one point.

06:43.670 --> 06:46.300
Just like that! Do it again!

06:52.390 --> 06:54.690
Can you believe this guy? A service ace!

06:55.140 --> 06:57.150
Catch up in one fell swoop!

06:57.900 --> 06:59.070
I'm sorry.

06:59.070 --> 07:01.070
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

07:01.070 --> 07:03.400
The ball's path changed like crazy.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.660
Even I thought it was going out.

07:05.660 --> 07:08.780
This is why I hate jump float serves.

07:09.200 --> 07:13.410
That was awesome, Yamaguchi!

07:11.990 --> 07:13.410
Y-Yeah.

07:13.410 --> 07:15.750
It's not that surprising.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.080
There you go agai—

07:18.080 --> 07:19.460
In the past five months,

07:19.880 --> 07:22.920
he practiced serving more than anyone else.

07:27.260 --> 07:29.390
Why, you little...

07:29.390 --> 07:31.560
Do it again, Yamaguchi!

07:29.390 --> 07:31.560
Aoba Jousai                      Karasuno

07:29.390 --> 07:31.560
Aoba Jousai                      Karasuno

07:32.060 --> 07:33.770
Give it all you've got!

07:33.770 --> 07:36.100
Give it all you've got, Yamaguchi!

07:36.100 --> 07:37.400
He'll be fine.

07:38.520 --> 07:42.360
You always feel worse after you run away.

07:43.990 --> 07:47.410
I'm pretty sure Yamaguchi feels that way too.

07:49.570 --> 07:52.870
A point to change the course of the match...

07:52.870 --> 07:55.040
Yeah, and...

07:56.040 --> 07:58.000
the start of our counterattack.

07:59.460 --> 08:00.330
Let's stop them here!

08:00.330 --> 08:01.250
Yeah.

08:03.500 --> 08:09.390
In a sport where passing the ball between players is vital, 
serving is the only thing done alone.

08:09.390 --> 08:10.430
Yeah.

08:10.760 --> 08:15.350
You could also say that it's the only way 
a player can score a point by themselves.

08:17.100 --> 08:23.440
In the evolution of volleyball, the serve has grown the most in terms of power and importance.

08:24.070 --> 08:26.860
And in modern volleyball,

08:27.740 --> 08:31.820
the serve is a powerful attack that 
can't be stopped by a wall of blockers.

08:33.530 --> 08:34.660
Kyoutani!

08:42.170 --> 08:43.380
Damn it!

08:45.000 --> 08:48.300
A-Another service ace!

08:48.720 --> 08:49.800
Yes!

08:49.800 --> 08:51.970
All right!

08:52.850 --> 08:54.970
Yamaguchi!

08:53.180 --> 08:54.350
Nice serve.

08:54.970 --> 08:56.220
What the hell?!

08:55.350 --> 08:57.680
Yamaguchi!

08:56.220 --> 08:57.680
His serve is amazing!

08:57.680 --> 08:59.230
Yamaguchi!

08:59.230 --> 09:00.900
Do it again!

09:02.350 --> 09:04.070
Bring it!

09:07.740 --> 09:08.740
Got it!

09:08.740 --> 09:09.900
<i>You receive jump floats...</i>

09:10.200 --> 09:11.990
<i>with overhand digs!</i>

09:12.780 --> 09:13.910
Nice, Makki.

09:15.580 --> 09:16.540
<i>He got it!</i>

09:16.540 --> 09:17.870
<i>They're going to attack now!</i>

09:18.540 --> 09:23.210
<i>There's a certain fear when you change from hunter to hunted.</i>

09:24.460 --> 09:26.250
Iwaizumi!

09:27.960 --> 09:29.670
<i>He received it with his body?!</i>

09:31.090 --> 09:32.890
<i>Not yet... Not yet!</i>

09:34.430 --> 09:36.310
<i>I'm not giving up my turn to serve just yet!</i>

09:38.270 --> 09:40.770
Someone get it!

09:41.690 --> 09:42.940
Thanks, Kageyama...

09:43.480 --> 09:44.900
It's all yours, Tsukishima!

09:50.490 --> 09:52.280
All right!

09:52.780 --> 09:53.990
Tsukki...

09:52.780 --> 09:54.410
A wipe!

09:54.410 --> 09:56.990
He dealt with the block really well.

09:54.820 --> 09:56.330
Tsukishima!

09:56.990 --> 09:59.700
Aoba Jousai                            Karasuno

09:56.990 --> 09:59.700
Aoba Jousai                            Karasuno

09:57.330 --> 09:58.870
That's three points in a row!

10:04.380 --> 10:05.460
Do it again.

10:09.510 --> 10:10.130
Yeah!

10:12.510 --> 10:15.140
Hey, Seijou's taking a timeout.

10:15.140 --> 10:17.560
They're physically stopping the momentum.

10:17.560 --> 10:20.180
All right!

10:20.180 --> 10:23.810
Making Seijou take a timeout is amazing, Yamaguchi!

10:23.480 --> 10:24.560
Yamaguchi!

10:23.810 --> 10:25.770
Th-Thanks.

10:26.110 --> 10:29.780
That number twelve sure has some guts with the way he received my spike.

10:29.780 --> 10:31.990
It was just luck.

10:35.360 --> 10:36.530
<i>Wow.</i>

10:37.700 --> 10:38.700
<i>It really hurts.</i>

10:39.910 --> 10:41.910
All right! Let's win this!

10:42.290 --> 10:44.370
Keep it up!

10:45.210 --> 10:47.960
<i>I can't do what they do.</i>

10:47.960 --> 10:50.380
<i>I want full control of my body!</i>

10:50.380 --> 10:52.260
<i>I want to control the ball!</i>

10:52.260 --> 10:54.800
<i>I want to play as equals against good players!</i>

10:57.050 --> 10:58.760
All right!

10:58.760 --> 11:00.220
Yamaguchi!

11:00.220 --> 11:01.970
Do it again!

11:01.970 --> 11:03.890
Keep your eye on the ball!

11:03.890 --> 11:04.690
Right!

11:10.860 --> 11:12.190
<i>Listen up, Tadashi.</i>

11:13.110 --> 11:16.110
Don't give them the chance to receive the ball.

11:16.110 --> 11:19.830
Aim for right above the white belt of the net...

11:21.700 --> 11:22.580
<i>...and hit!</i>

11:28.540 --> 11:30.500
<i>I only have one weapon I can fight with:</i>

11:32.130 --> 11:33.050
<i>my serve.</i>

11:34.970 --> 11:38.970
<i>I got the chance to serve just one time.</i>

11:40.140 --> 11:46.440
<i>I'm going to fight by putting my pride and 
the momentum of the match into that serve.</i>

11:47.440 --> 11:48.400
<i>I am...</i>

11:55.440 --> 11:56.780
<i>a pinch server.</i>

11:59.280 --> 12:01.450
It went over!

12:01.450 --> 12:03.120
Is luck on our side now?

12:03.120 --> 12:05.290
No, it's not just that.

12:06.870 --> 12:08.000
Now...

12:08.540 --> 12:13.000
Aoba Jousai                Karasuno

12:08.540 --> 12:13.000
Aoba Jousai                Karasuno

12:09.920 --> 12:11.210
it's tied.

Aoba Jousai                Karasuno

12:28.390 --> 12:29.900
Now they're tied!

12:29.900 --> 12:31.440
Karasuno caught up!

12:32.650 --> 12:34.860
Yamaguchi!

12:32.650 --> 12:36.860
He just barely hit it over the net in the Waku South match too, right?!

12:36.860 --> 12:38.820
Tadashi's a lucky boy!

12:38.820 --> 12:40.200
Yep!

12:40.200 --> 12:45.370
Though it barely went over the net, there's not much similarity between what happened just now and earlier.

12:46.000 --> 12:52.630
During the Waku South match, Tadashi was probably thinking about whether or not the ball would go over.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.960
Do it again, Yamaguchi!

12:47.960 --> 12:50.080
Give us a good serve, Yamaguchi!

12:52.630 --> 12:54.340
But right now,

12:55.210 --> 12:56.630
he's thinking about where to aim it.

12:57.510 --> 13:00.760
That last serve was the result of going on the offensive.

13:02.760 --> 13:05.180
How awesome, Tadashi!

13:03.100 --> 13:07.730
<i>That said, I'm not sure he's entirely aware of it.</i>

13:08.890 --> 13:10.640
Do it again, Yamaguchi!

13:09.390 --> 13:11.900
<i>For some reason, my serve toss isn't going very high.</i>

13:12.690 --> 13:14.150
Right!

13:15.320 --> 13:16.360
Let's calm down, okay?

13:16.730 --> 13:17.900
We <i>are</i> calm.

13:17.900 --> 13:20.360
Not much we could do about that last one.

13:20.360 --> 13:21.570
We'll get the next one.

13:21.570 --> 13:25.580
You guys are so reliable that it makes me a little sad!

13:41.970 --> 13:43.550
<i>It's spinning slightly!</i>

13:43.550 --> 13:44.850
<i>The ball's not changing direction!</i>

13:44.850 --> 13:45.970
Got it!

13:46.430 --> 13:48.350
Nice receive!

13:52.850 --> 13:53.600
I touched it!

13:53.600 --> 13:54.980
Nice job!

13:57.230 --> 13:58.440
Azumane!

13:58.440 --> 13:59.610
Nice, Kageyama!

14:00.650 --> 14:01.610
Three blockers!

14:01.900 --> 14:03.820
<i>And three very tall blockers at that.</i>

14:07.240 --> 14:08.950
In back!

14:09.450 --> 14:11.580
It's going out!

14:13.370 --> 14:14.960
All right!

14:15.380 --> 14:17.710
Nice call, Tanaka!

14:15.380 --> 14:17.710
Whoa, seriously?

14:17.710 --> 14:18.920
Karasuno...

14:18.920 --> 14:22.630
Aoba Jousai

14:18.920 --> 14:22.630
Aoba Jousai

14:18.920 --> 14:22.630
Karasuno

14:18.920 --> 14:22.630
Karasuno

14:20.130 --> 14:22.130
is at match point!

14:23.220 --> 14:24.300
Give us another good serve!

14:24.300 --> 14:25.840
Yamaguchi...

14:26.600 --> 14:28.760
is the hero of this match.

14:29.770 --> 14:31.520
Just one more point...

14:31.520 --> 14:33.520
Just one more point and we win!

14:33.980 --> 14:35.190
Land it!

14:35.190 --> 14:36.560
Please, land this serve!

14:36.560 --> 14:37.730
Tadashi!

14:37.730 --> 14:40.690
Yamaguchi! Just one more!

14:41.150 --> 14:43.280
Land this serve!

14:53.250 --> 14:54.500
<i>That felt good.</i>

14:57.210 --> 14:58.670
I'll get it!

15:00.590 --> 15:02.210
Damn, he's really good.

15:00.590 --> 15:02.210
Nice, Watacchi!

15:07.850 --> 15:10.060
Stop it!

15:07.850 --> 15:10.060
Stop it, please!

15:14.440 --> 15:16.190
All right!

15:16.190 --> 15:18.060
Nice spike!

15:16.980 --> 15:18.480
We finally ended their streak.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.900
How many points did he score, anyway?

15:28.490 --> 15:30.530
That was a marvelous performance!

15:30.530 --> 15:31.540
Good job!

15:31.540 --> 15:32.950
Thank you.

15:32.950 --> 15:34.540
You did great, Yamaguchi!

15:33.660 --> 15:34.540
All right!

15:34.540 --> 15:34.960
Thanks!

15:34.960 --> 15:36.420
That was awesome!

15:37.710 --> 15:39.590
Focus on one point at a time!

15:39.590 --> 15:40.750
Next time,

15:42.500 --> 15:43.920
I'll score ten points.

15:46.340 --> 15:47.590
You're on!

15:49.470 --> 15:51.220
Give us a good serve, Hanamaki!

15:50.140 --> 15:52.010
<i>Yamaguchi gave us this opportunity.</i>

15:54.350 --> 15:55.390
Daichi!

15:55.390 --> 15:56.480
<i>We won't let it go to waste!</i>

15:59.980 --> 16:01.610
All right!

16:01.610 --> 16:03.570
Nice, Azumane!

16:03.570 --> 16:05.360
Here they are again!

16:05.360 --> 16:06.780
Match point!

16:06.780 --> 16:09.200
Go!

16:13.160 --> 16:14.500
All right!

16:14.500 --> 16:16.540
They took a point back so easily.

16:16.540 --> 16:20.250
They managed to get a fast attack off even while cornered.

16:20.250 --> 16:22.420
Not to mention, he just hit it straight forward.

16:22.920 --> 16:25.260
If it were me, I'd totally be relying on the ace.

16:25.260 --> 16:26.380
Yeah!

16:26.380 --> 16:28.340
Aoba Jousai                Karasuno

16:26.380 --> 16:28.340
Aoba Jousai                Karasuno

16:29.050 --> 16:30.260
Nice receive!

16:30.260 --> 16:31.300
Watch for the dump!

16:33.760 --> 16:35.060
All right!

16:35.060 --> 16:36.680
Nice spike, Tsukishima!

16:36.060 --> 16:38.390
Hey, you're stiff, Kindaichi.

16:38.390 --> 16:39.770
Yes! No!

16:39.770 --> 16:40.850
Which is it?

16:41.610 --> 16:43.270
<i>This is a critical moment for us.</i>

16:43.940 --> 16:47.650
<i>We can't make this the third-years' last match.</i>

16:47.650 --> 16:49.990
Don't worry about anything else.

16:51.110 --> 16:55.580
All you need to focus on is scoring one point at a time.

16:56.750 --> 16:57.540
Right!

16:57.540 --> 16:59.540
You can do this, Asahi!

16:59.540 --> 17:01.040
Give us a good serve!

17:07.710 --> 17:09.220
It went long! Sorry!

17:14.600 --> 17:15.970
All right!

17:15.970 --> 17:17.060
Nice spike!

17:17.060 --> 17:18.230
Thanks!

17:17.060 --> 17:18.230
Thanks for saving me!

17:18.520 --> 17:20.440
Seijou sure is good.

17:20.440 --> 17:24.190
This next point is huge, but...

17:27.440 --> 17:28.570
<i>And...</i>

17:29.950 --> 17:33.950
<i>in modern volleyball,</i>

17:35.120 --> 17:37.660
<i>the serve is a powerful attack...</i>

17:43.080 --> 17:45.130
<i>that can't be stopped by a wall of blockers.</i>

18:03.900 --> 18:05.520
<i>That was basically a spike.</i>

18:07.190 --> 18:12.860
All right!

18:12.860 --> 18:15.820
<b>Rule the Court</b>

18:12.860 --> 18:15.820
<b>Rule the Court</b>

18:13.490 --> 18:15.820
Do it again!

18:15.820 --> 18:18.330
Seijou turned it around and is now at set point!

18:15.820 --> 18:20.290
Aoba Jousai                           Karasuno

18:15.820 --> 18:20.290
Aoba Jousai                           Karasuno

18:18.330 --> 18:20.290
Will they go on and take this set?

18:20.290 --> 18:22.750
Damn it all!

18:23.290 --> 18:25.710
There's no way just the two of us can handle this.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.760
Sorry, Asahi, but we need your help.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.090
Sure.

18:31.090 --> 18:33.630
Azumane's going to help receiving the serve too?

18:33.630 --> 18:38.060
If that's what Sawamura and Nishinoya decided,
 then it's probably a good idea.

18:38.060 --> 18:42.730
Oikawa seems to focus more on power than control when he serves.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.810
Rather than him getting a service ace,

18:46.810 --> 18:49.400
it's better to get the ball up in the air any way they can.

18:51.110 --> 18:55.280
They've had plenty of practice with 
Ubugawa's and Fukurodani's serves.

18:56.030 --> 18:57.070
It's fine.

18:57.070 --> 18:58.120
They can handle this.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.200
Bring it!

19:01.660 --> 19:03.410
Give us a good one!

19:11.840 --> 19:12.550
Daichi!

19:13.760 --> 19:14.970
Yes!

19:19.510 --> 19:20.760
Nice job, Tanaka!

19:20.760 --> 19:21.970
Kageyama!

19:21.970 --> 19:24.100
Asahi!

19:26.400 --> 19:27.850
Nice receive!

19:41.080 --> 19:43.290
All right!

19:43.290 --> 19:45.750
Aoba Jousai                Karasuno

19:43.290 --> 19:45.750
Aoba Jousai                Karasuno

19:46.210 --> 19:48.040
They took back a set!

19:48.040 --> 19:50.460
I thought Karasuno was gonna take it in straight sets.

19:50.460 --> 19:52.800
Man, we almost had them!

19:52.800 --> 19:53.840
It's fine!

19:53.840 --> 19:55.300
You're just getting started!

19:55.300 --> 19:56.630
Damn!

19:56.630 --> 19:58.430
That third set is gonna be rough!

19:58.720 --> 19:59.850
Let's change gears!

19:59.850 --> 20:00.640
Right!

20:00.640 --> 20:03.430
His serve really is amazing.

20:04.180 --> 20:06.310
You were awesome too, Yamaguchi.

20:06.310 --> 20:08.520
He's much more experienced than I am.

20:09.440 --> 20:14.030
That might be obvious because he's a third-year, but I think there's more to it than that.

20:14.030 --> 20:15.530
More to it?

20:16.490 --> 20:20.870
Jump serves are riskier but provide unparalleled power.

20:21.780 --> 20:26.750
He was able to make his serve even more powerful yet not mess it up when they were cornered.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.460
He's something special.

20:34.130 --> 20:35.710
Yamaguchi!

20:36.130 --> 20:37.550
Those were nice serves!

20:37.550 --> 20:39.260
Th-Thanks!

20:39.260 --> 20:41.470
But I've still got a ways to go.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.600
Only half of my serves were any good.

20:46.270 --> 20:49.980
Then be really happy about the half that <i>were</i> good!

20:51.350 --> 20:54.860
Reflection and regret will happen on their own.

20:54.860 --> 20:59.280
Right now, you need to take a firm grasp on this good feeling to make sure you don't forget it!

20:59.280 --> 21:00.490
Really grab it!

21:00.490 --> 21:03.200
And then repeat it next time.

21:06.500 --> 21:07.500
Right!

21:10.170 --> 21:11.960
In the end, we're playing all three sets.

21:16.250 --> 21:17.670
It started with our first practice match.

21:26.220 --> 21:27.890
Then the interhigh prelims.

21:35.900 --> 21:37.230
And then now.

21:45.280 --> 21:47.410
We're having our most intense match yet.

21:51.040 --> 21:52.290
<i>Difficult opponents...</i>

21:53.500 --> 21:55.040
<i>Annoying opponents...</i>

21:56.500 --> 21:59.300
<i>Until last year, we didn't have that much connecting us.</i>

22:00.630 --> 22:02.800
<i>They were supposed to be beneath us.</i>

22:04.890 --> 22:07.680
<i>We're destined to play all three sets against these guys.</i>

22:08.770 --> 22:11.480
Aoba Jousai                     Karasuno

22:08.770 --> 22:11.480
Aoba Jousai                     Karasuno

22:09.680 --> 22:11.480
<i>The third set...</i>

22:12.600 --> 22:14.400
<i>This is our final battle!</i>

22:15.980 --> 22:15.980
{ED}

22:28.160 --> 22:32.290
When I was just a nobody, something lit up my eyes

22:32.290 --> 22:38.090
I was merely a guy languishing complacently in the dark, happy with what I had

22:32.290 --> 22:38.090
I was merely a guy languishing complacently in the dark, happy with what I had

22:38.090 --> 22:42.510
Now I'm torn toward the heavens even on a starless night

22:42.510 --> 22:47.550
Whether our time comes to us or not is a matter for those in another world

22:47.600 --> 22:57.770
That's right, our lungs pumping and our hearts beating is all we have in this new realm

22:47.600 --> 22:57.770
That's right, our lungs pumping and our hearts beating is all we have in this new realm

22:57.770 --> 23:02.900
We've always been dancing on an unlit stage, but now beyond that

23:02.900 --> 23:09.700
We're awaiting the rising of a sun that none have yet witnessed

23:09.700 --> 23:15.620
Now that we're deliberating at a crossroads, paths blurring together

23:09.700 --> 23:15.620
Now that we're deliberating at a crossroads, paths blurring together

23:16.170 --> 23:18.250
We can feel it

23:16.170 --> 23:18.250
We can feel it

23:18.250 --> 23:23.380
Inside this uncharted world which has yet to take on a name

23:23.380 --> 23:29.640
As I'm waiting for the dawn to reach my eyes with a familiar light

23:29.640 --> 23:36.560
I'm reminded of days I won't return to, and seeking proof of newfound existence

23:36.560 --> 23:39.400
We brace ourselves

23:45.950 --> 23:45.950
{Preview}

23:46.700 --> 23:48.370
<i>That was amazing, Yamaguchi!</i>

23:48.370 --> 23:49.620
<i>Th-Thanks, Yachi.</i>

23:49.620 --> 23:55.870
<i>Just in case, I had an AED, stretcher, and coffin prepared,
 but they weren't necessary at all!</i>

23:55.870 --> 23:58.380
<i>Huh?! Wasn't there something strange at the end of that list?!</i>

23:57.330 --> 24:00.960
Episode Twenty-three: 
"Team"

23:57.330 --> 24:00.960
Episode Twenty-three:
