00:10.370 --> 00:12.330
Nice spike, Hyakuzawa!

00:12.620 --> 00:13.870
Nice spike, Hyakuzawa!

00:13.870 --> 00:15.540
Whoa, the angle on his spike is insane!

00:16.700 --> 00:18.370
Nice spike!

00:20.210 --> 00:22.250
Let's have a good match!

00:22.590 --> 00:25.260
He looks so intense up close.

00:25.550 --> 00:29.970
You look like you're doing well again today, Hyakuzawa, so we should be set.

00:29.970 --> 00:31.550
Oh, yes, sir.

00:31.550 --> 00:35.890
Looks like no one on the other side can match your height.

00:35.890 --> 00:37.140
Oh, yes.

00:37.140 --> 00:39.810
If there's a rule you don't understand again, ask us.

00:39.810 --> 00:41.940
I think I understand the rules now.

00:42.310 --> 00:48.190
You've seen how their number three and nine serve, 
so let's get our receives up and have each other's back.

00:48.190 --> 00:51.450
Our opponent is the team that gave Seijou a hard time...

00:52.070 --> 00:53.450
but that doesn't matter right now.

00:53.780 --> 00:56.870
We just need to make use of our strengths and fight.

00:56.870 --> 00:57.910
Let's go!

00:56.870 --> 00:59.330
Kakugawa               Karasuno

00:56.870 --> 00:59.330
Kakugawa               Karasuno

00:57.910 --> 00:59.330
Yeah!

01:06.710 --> 01:09.630
<i>If we win this match, 
we'll advance past the first round of the prelims.</i>

01:10.220 --> 01:12.590
<i>Who the hell cares if they've got a guy who's two meters tall?</i>

01:14.640 --> 01:16.390
<i>We won't lose!</i>

01:17.930 --> 01:17.930
{OP}

01:27.030 --> 01:31.900
I keep running as I run out of breath

01:31.900 --> 01:36.830
With dreams on my mind and a fire in my belly

01:31.950 --> 01:36.830

I feel like I'll be left behind in this world

01:41.750 --> 01:46.420
If I come to a standstill

01:46.880 --> 01:51.590
People ask me why I find joy in this

01:51.590 --> 01:56.180
But I don't understand it myself

01:56.640 --> 02:01.060
Running is the only thing on my mind

02:01.060 --> 02:05.230
Even if nothing goes right in the future

02:05.230 --> 02:10.860
I won't stop trying to find the best version of myself

02:10.860 --> 02:15.160
Even if someone tells me that this is as far as I go

02:15.160 --> 02:17.240
And draws the line on me

02:17.240 --> 02:21.160
I'll say no, thank you, and surge on ahead

02:21.830 --> 02:22.660
So what?

02:22.660 --> 02:24.290
Whatever the future may bring

02:24.290 --> 02:25.000
So what?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.790
However people are supposed to act

02:26.790 --> 02:27.540
So what?

02:27.540 --> 02:31.210
It doesn't really matter

02:33.220 --> 02:36.180
So I'm a believer

02:38.140 --> 02:43.940
So I'm a believer

02:48.020 --> 02:48.020

Episode Thirteen:

02:48.400 --> 02:50.980
Episode Thirteen: 
Simple, Pure Strength

02:49.770 --> 02:51.780
Give us a good serve, Tsukishima!

02:53.320 --> 02:54.150
Musshi!

02:54.150 --> 02:54.990
Got it!

02:55.780 --> 02:56.570
Hyakuzawa!

02:56.950 --> 02:59.780
They're taking each other head-on!

02:59.780 --> 03:03.120
Looks like they want to start off on a good note with a shot from their ace.

03:03.120 --> 03:04.460
Three blockers!

03:05.120 --> 03:07.580
<i>Well, I guess it doesn't matter much.</i>

03:11.380 --> 03:13.050
<i>From above?</i>

03:16.090 --> 03:17.550
All right!

03:17.550 --> 03:19.760
He hit that from above the block...

03:18.260 --> 03:19.760
Hyakuzawa, nice spike!

03:20.970 --> 03:22.180
Seriously?

03:22.180 --> 03:24.390
There's no point in even trying to block.

03:24.390 --> 03:27.350
Kakugawa               Karasuno

03:24.390 --> 03:27.350
Kakugawa               Karasuno

03:25.100 --> 03:26.520
Coming from the left!

03:26.520 --> 03:27.350
Hyakuzawa!

03:29.650 --> 03:30.690
Sorry, cover it for me!

03:31.230 --> 03:32.900
Finish it off, Hinata!

03:34.860 --> 03:36.400
<i>If I spike it, it'll get blocked.</i>

03:38.320 --> 03:39.530
<i>Is he gonna tip it?!</i>

03:47.040 --> 03:48.250
All right!

03:50.250 --> 03:52.090
He's unbelievably tall...

03:52.710 --> 03:56.380
Normally, that would've been able to go over the block.

03:56.380 --> 03:57.880
One more!

03:56.880 --> 03:59.050
But he's just ridiculously tall.

03:57.880 --> 03:59.050
Right.

03:59.050 --> 04:00.390
Listen carefully, Hyakuzawa.

04:00.390 --> 04:03.470
Sorry! The ball was a little low.

04:01.140 --> 04:07.310
No matter what tricky moves their number ten does, just keep your eye on the ball as you're blocking.

04:03.470 --> 04:04.470
Don't worry about it.

04:04.470 --> 04:05.480
You'll get the next one!

04:05.480 --> 04:07.310
Yeah. Now let's stop them.

04:07.310 --> 04:07.850
Right.

04:07.310 --> 04:07.850
Yes, sir!

04:10.480 --> 04:12.480
<i>There are more people here now.</i>

04:10.480 --> 04:12.480
See? That's the two-meters tall guy.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.400
Wow, you weren't kidding.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.190
Wow, he's huge.

04:16.190 --> 04:17.780
Oh, Ms. Mikako.

04:18.360 --> 04:21.240
Oh, Mr. Oonoya. Hello there!

04:21.240 --> 04:23.160
This is my neighbor.

04:23.160 --> 04:26.250
Ms. Mikako advises the junior high volleyball team.

04:27.330 --> 04:30.920
One of the players on the opposing team is really tall.

04:30.920 --> 04:36.420
My team is full of short kids, 
so I can't help but sympathize with the smaller team.

04:38.170 --> 04:39.550
No need to worry.

04:39.550 --> 04:43.260
That big guy's got nothing on Karasuno's number ten.

04:43.260 --> 04:44.720
Right, Coach Ukai?

04:44.720 --> 04:46.770
It's true that he's at a disadvantage.

04:48.180 --> 04:49.850
He's much shorter and less powerful.

04:50.650 --> 04:59.280
Simple, pure strength beyond a certain level suddenly becomes something that keeps ordinary people away.

04:59.780 --> 05:03.240
At least, when you face someone like that head-on.

05:07.250 --> 05:10.210
What the hell? Why are you moving your fingers like a pervy old man?

05:15.630 --> 05:16.800
<i>I'm not imagining it.</i>

05:16.800 --> 05:19.420
<i>The ball really </i>does<i> seem to fit in my hands better.</i>

05:19.880 --> 05:22.090
Kakugawa               Karasuno

05:19.880 --> 05:22.090
Kakugawa               Karasuno

05:23.550 --> 05:25.560
It's right above the net!

05:25.560 --> 05:27.010
Push it over, Hinata!

05:27.010 --> 05:28.310
<i>They have no chance.</i>

05:28.310 --> 05:31.980
<i>There's no way they can beat Hyakuzawa at pushing the ball over the net.</i>

05:36.520 --> 05:37.610
All right!

05:39.690 --> 05:40.700
It's going out of bounds!

05:41.900 --> 05:44.570
Hey, Karasuno finally scored.

05:42.700 --> 05:44.070
All right!

05:44.570 --> 05:46.240
Only because their opponent messed up.

05:46.660 --> 05:50.790
I'd never heard of Kakugawa before, 
but they're really making a name for themselves.

05:50.790 --> 05:53.580
It's all thanks to that guy who's two meters tall.

05:53.580 --> 05:55.170
It's basically a one-man show.

05:56.040 --> 05:57.670
<i>Crap! He heard us!</i>

05:58.050 --> 06:00.420
We already know that.

06:00.420 --> 06:02.010
Like I care.

06:02.010 --> 06:03.010
What?!

06:03.010 --> 06:05.140
Come on. Number nine is serving.

06:05.140 --> 06:06.720
We're gonna stop them at one point!

06:05.930 --> 06:07.600
Give us a good one, Kageyama!

06:14.270 --> 06:15.060
It went way off course!

06:15.440 --> 06:16.650
Mine!

06:16.650 --> 06:20.860
<i>As long as we can dig out the serve, we always have a chance to score!</i>

06:24.950 --> 06:26.660
All right!

06:27.120 --> 06:30.200
I see. We're gonna have to do something about that.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.330
Nice spike, Hyakuzawa!

06:29.330 --> 06:30.200
Oh, yes.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.200
<i>However...</i>

06:33.920 --> 06:34.670
Sir.

06:35.290 --> 06:36.080
Right.

06:38.420 --> 06:40.050
A timeout, huh?

06:38.420 --> 06:40.050
All right!

06:40.050 --> 06:42.720
Looks like Karasuno can't do anything to stop them.

06:42.720 --> 06:45.010
<i>W-We definitely can!</i>

06:45.470 --> 06:46.840
You're on a roll!

06:46.840 --> 06:50.470
You're doing a great job in your first official match, Hyakuzawa.

06:50.470 --> 06:52.180
Oh, yes.

06:52.180 --> 06:53.480
Don't worry.

06:54.730 --> 06:58.230
Just like other teams have aces, we have Hyakuzawa.

06:58.980 --> 07:02.900
Hyakuzawa doing well means we've done a good job keeping the ball in play.

07:03.360 --> 07:05.200
Even if we aren't in the spotlight as much.

07:05.200 --> 07:10.450
All you have to do is look smug as if you're bragging, "How's this? Hyakuzawa sure is amazing, isn't he?"

07:10.450 --> 07:12.040
Indeed.

07:12.040 --> 07:15.670
Our job is try as hard as we can to get everything out of Hyakuzawa.

07:16.500 --> 07:20.250
Even if they call us a one-man team, that's how we win matches!

07:24.130 --> 07:25.050
What's wrong?

07:25.590 --> 07:31.390
I sort of feel bad when their number ten tries his hardest to jump high even though he's so short.

07:31.390 --> 07:33.140
Was that sarcasm?

07:33.140 --> 07:34.270
Oh, no.

07:34.600 --> 07:41.480
Well, it's true that he stands no chance even though you've only played volleyball for half a year.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.900
It must be a bitter pill to swallow.

07:44.820 --> 07:48.700
Passing in volleyball is challenging, but it's...

07:49.990 --> 07:51.030
simple.

07:52.950 --> 07:55.080
No matter how high I jump, 
he keeps hitting from above me.

07:55.080 --> 07:56.120
What should I do?

07:56.120 --> 07:58.120
Just calm down.

07:58.120 --> 07:58.870
Shouyou,

07:59.960 --> 08:02.550
there's more to volleyball than just fighting it out at the net.

08:02.960 --> 08:03.920
Huh?

08:03.920 --> 08:05.420
There's something I noticed.

08:09.260 --> 08:11.470
Kakugawa               Karasuno

08:09.260 --> 08:11.470
Kakugawa               Karasuno

08:10.390 --> 08:11.470
Left, left!

08:14.640 --> 08:15.560
Hyakuzawa!

08:16.180 --> 08:17.180
<i>Here he comes!</i>

08:17.180 --> 08:20.270
Based on their previous match, warmup, and how they're playing in this match,

08:20.270 --> 08:23.900
it appears that Kakugawa's number nine can't control where to spike the ball.

08:24.820 --> 08:28.400
He only does cross-court shots in the direction he's facing.

08:29.990 --> 08:34.740
Judging from their practice, their number nine
 must've started playing volleyball not that long ago.

08:34.740 --> 08:37.160
So he's like Lev from Nekoma?

08:37.160 --> 08:40.710
He lacks the speed and dexterity of Lev.

08:40.710 --> 08:46.710
Put another way, his overwhelming height is all he has.

08:46.710 --> 08:51.680
That's why when number nine is going to hit, 
we can disregard the possibility of straight spikes.

08:54.220 --> 08:55.350
All right!

08:58.020 --> 08:59.350
He's doing that diagonal jump!

08:59.350 --> 09:00.020
Go!

09:05.860 --> 09:07.230
All right!

09:07.230 --> 09:09.360
He somehow managed to get it past.

09:09.360 --> 09:11.570
Kakugawa               Karasuno

09:09.360 --> 09:11.570
Kakugawa               Karasuno

09:09.990 --> 09:11.570
Karasuno is amazing!

09:11.860 --> 09:15.990
They managed to successfully deal 
with that two-meter tall guy's attack!

09:15.990 --> 09:18.790
It all depends on how they're going to attack next.

09:19.330 --> 09:20.500
Tanaka, your serve.

09:20.500 --> 09:21.790
R-Right.

09:21.790 --> 09:22.540
I'm...

09:23.830 --> 09:24.710
feeling good today.

09:36.220 --> 09:37.930
Calm down, Hinata.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.600
He's really sparkly.

09:38.600 --> 09:42.140
He looks just like my dog when it sees food on an empty stomach.

09:45.980 --> 09:47.230
Minamida!

09:47.230 --> 09:48.190
Got it!

09:48.900 --> 09:49.440
Hyakuzawa!

09:51.070 --> 09:52.530
All right!

09:54.570 --> 10:00.450
No matter what tricky moves their number ten does, just keep your eye on the ball as you're blocking.

10:00.450 --> 10:02.460
<i>Just keep my eye on the ball...</i>

10:12.970 --> 10:14.930
There it is! Their super fast attack!

10:16.640 --> 10:20.100
<i>It's actually a bit different from 
the last time you saw it, you know.</i>

10:20.100 --> 10:21.890
Your face looks weird, Yacchi.

10:22.480 --> 10:25.940
Yahoo! That little number ten is amazing!

10:23.060 --> 10:27.360
He's probably the tallest player in the prelims at 201 cm,

10:28.360 --> 10:30.570
but the player who'll likely be toying with him the most

10:31.530 --> 10:33.950
is only 162 cm tall.

10:35.280 --> 10:42.120

10:49.960 --> 10:54.130
Passing in volleyball is challenging, but it's...

10:54.840 --> 10:55.720
simple.

10:56.390 --> 10:57.550
<i>How?!</i>

10:57.970 --> 11:01.850
<i>I'm 201 cm tall, and he's only 162 cm tall!</i>

11:02.850 --> 11:05.060
<i>Why is he above me right now?!</i>

11:06.900 --> 11:07.650
All right!

11:07.310 --> 11:10.270
Kakugawa              Karasuno

11:07.310 --> 11:10.270
Kakugawa              Karasuno

11:07.650 --> 11:09.230
It's that fast attack from number ten again!

11:09.230 --> 11:10.270
How many is that now?

11:10.820 --> 11:15.860
Boo-yah, boo-yah, boo-yah, boo-yah!

11:11.400 --> 11:12.530
We're amazing!

11:12.530 --> 11:14.700
Aren't we amazing, Kageyama?!

11:14.700 --> 11:16.740
Shut the hell up, all of you!

11:17.110 --> 11:20.580
As long as we can land those fast attacks, the team's back to their best!

11:17.450 --> 11:18.450
S-Sorry.

11:20.580 --> 11:21.950
Not exactly, sir.

11:22.410 --> 11:25.660
You're thinking about what the team was like until recently.

11:27.630 --> 11:29.500
Relax, Hinata!

11:30.590 --> 11:32.590
<i>He's way off in the corner.</i>

11:32.590 --> 11:36.220
<i>Sugawara said it was so nobody 
would go after him while serving.</i>

11:36.760 --> 11:39.220
<i>Well, it's not like I could aim it there if I tried!</i>

11:40.100 --> 11:43.560
It's not uncommon to see spikers 
that concentrate solely on offense,

11:44.140 --> 11:48.770
but in Kakugawa's case, it seems like number nine is being protected by the other members of his team.

11:50.480 --> 11:53.900
When number nine is in the back row, I feel relieved.

11:52.270 --> 11:53.320
Nice receive!

11:53.900 --> 11:55.950
Don't let your guard down, sir.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.280
Two blockers!

11:58.240 --> 11:59.110
I should've listened!

11:59.410 --> 12:00.530
It's coming back!

12:00.530 --> 12:02.080
Spike it straight away!

12:02.370 --> 12:05.330
Rather than practicing defense or figuring out how to aim,

12:05.330 --> 12:10.080
I'm sure that their number nine just practiced hitting the high balls as hard as possible.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.080
Go, Makado!

12:10.880 --> 12:16.720
That said, while he's in the back row, the mid-air battles near the net...

12:19.300 --> 12:21.260
still favor us!

12:22.510 --> 12:23.850
Number ten!

12:28.020 --> 12:29.480
All right!

12:29.480 --> 12:31.190
Kakugawa               Karasuno

12:29.480 --> 12:31.190
Kakugawa               Karasuno

12:30.020 --> 12:31.190
We're on set point!

12:31.520 --> 12:33.150
Yeah, we are.

12:33.440 --> 12:34.650
Just one more point!

12:34.650 --> 12:36.530
Get it in one shot!

12:36.530 --> 12:37.610
Coach!

12:38.200 --> 12:41.620
Is that fast attack from Shou still first tempo?

12:41.620 --> 12:44.160
Do you remember your tempos?

12:44.160 --> 12:44.830
Yep!

12:49.210 --> 12:50.120
Nice receive!

12:50.670 --> 12:55.630
When the set goes up real high, 
and the spiker starts his approach with some leeway,

12:57.210 --> 12:58.470
that's third tempo.

13:02.340 --> 13:05.310
Kakugawa                   Karasuno

13:02.340 --> 13:05.310
Kakugawa                   Karasuno

13:02.640 --> 13:03.970
All right!

13:03.970 --> 13:05.310
Nice, Hyakuzawa!

13:06.100 --> 13:09.520
Doing a running approach at the same time the set goes up and then spiking

13:10.730 --> 13:11.980
is second tempo.

13:13.940 --> 13:15.110
All right!

13:15.400 --> 13:16.110
Nice, Musshi!

13:16.110 --> 13:20.400
When the spiker starts his approach first and the set is adjusted to where he goes,

13:21.570 --> 13:22.870
that's first tempo.

13:25.700 --> 13:26.370
Nice, Nishinoya!

13:26.370 --> 13:31.460
Beating a block is when you spike the ball from above the block.

13:32.290 --> 13:37.670
In Munchkin vs Mr. Two Meters Tall, the winner is whoever can reach the peak of their jump first.

13:38.050 --> 13:42.630
That fast attack from Munchkin isn't strictly first tempo.

13:43.590 --> 13:50.560
At the point when the set is going up, the spiker's approach and takeoff have already been completed.

13:57.020 --> 13:58.570
It's minus tempo.

14:06.280 --> 14:06.330
{=0}Karasuno

14:06.870 --> 14:08.540
Minus tempo!

14:09.120 --> 14:11.370
Don't even think about trying that for yourself.

14:11.370 --> 14:13.120
Huh? Why not?

14:13.580 --> 14:18.460
That amazing feat is something only those two can achieve.

14:19.920 --> 14:23.880
Hey, you know how you asked before the match if I was actually scared?

14:23.880 --> 14:26.720
Was that because you knew that the fast attack would go well today?

14:27.430 --> 14:28.510
Not really.

14:28.510 --> 14:31.480
I did feel better than usual, though.

14:31.480 --> 14:33.690
Then why'd you say that?

14:34.560 --> 14:37.900
I mean, you practiced really hard back in Tokyo, right?

14:38.360 --> 14:39.900
Things other than the fast attack, I mean.

14:41.110 --> 14:44.740
They <i>did</i> stop your first tip really easily, though.

14:44.740 --> 14:46.070
Shut up!

14:46.780 --> 14:50.540
Instead of recklessly jumping after their number ten,
 let's instead focus on stopping the rest.

14:50.540 --> 14:51.410
Yeah.

14:51.410 --> 14:57.290
It's true that we can't block their number ten, but the same goes for them and Hyakuzawa.

14:58.210 --> 14:59.800
It's a war to see who can score more points.

15:04.970 --> 15:05.590
Nice receive!

15:05.590 --> 15:06.430
Here comes number ten!

15:07.760 --> 15:08.640
Cover for me!

15:09.260 --> 15:09.850
Hyakuzawa!

15:13.230 --> 15:14.690
All right!

15:15.100 --> 15:16.150
Damn it.

15:16.440 --> 15:17.520
Shake it off!

15:17.520 --> 15:19.360
We'll score two points for every one they do!

15:19.360 --> 15:20.400
Right!

15:20.400 --> 15:23.110
That's why we increased the number of weapons in our arsenal!

15:23.780 --> 15:25.200
Coach,

15:25.200 --> 15:28.450
if I have to face off against someone that tall,

15:28.450 --> 15:31.580
do I need to be able to do an attack like Shou and his friend to win?

15:32.830 --> 15:34.580
No way.

15:36.040 --> 15:38.210
If you can't win alone,

15:36.420 --> 15:37.370
Nice receive!

15:38.580 --> 15:40.000
you just need to increase your numbers.

15:40.750 --> 15:43.380
Hey, four people started moving at the same time!

15:43.920 --> 15:46.590
It's a synchronized attack at first tempo!

15:51.100 --> 15:52.810
All right!

15:52.140 --> 15:54.270
<i>We can barely handle number ten by himself...</i>

15:52.810 --> 15:54.270
Nice, Tanaka!

15:54.270 --> 15:55.770
I'll get that point back!

15:54.270 --> 15:55.310
Thanks!

15:56.890 --> 15:59.610
That's all I can do.

16:11.910 --> 16:13.370
Kakugawa's number nine...

16:13.990 --> 16:18.580
He should be completely exhausted by now, yet he's looking more and more powerful.

16:18.870 --> 16:20.170
Up front!

16:20.170 --> 16:21.880
Nice receive!

16:21.880 --> 16:25.130
<i>It's true that I have basically no experience, but...</i>

16:24.210 --> 16:25.130
Hyakuzawa!

16:25.960 --> 16:27.470
<i>I can score!</i>

16:29.130 --> 16:30.930
Sorry, it went too high!

16:29.510 --> 16:31.430
<i>Technique is irrelevant.</i>

16:30.930 --> 16:32.100
Hyakuzawa, just spike it back!

16:31.430 --> 16:32.100
<i>I'll just snatch it away...</i>

16:32.720 --> 16:34.310
<i>and smash it into the ground!</i>

16:34.680 --> 16:36.270
All right!

16:41.400 --> 16:43.860
Karasuno                   Kakugawa

16:41.400 --> 16:43.860
Karasuno                   Kakugawa

16:41.730 --> 16:43.110
Yeah!

16:43.110 --> 16:44.270
Nice spike, Tanaka!

16:44.270 --> 16:45.860
Match point!

16:46.360 --> 16:50.530
Karasuno's current rotation has short blockers in front, so this is a chance for Kakugawa to catch up.

16:50.860 --> 16:55.240
Even though they're average height,
 against someone two meters tall, they look like shrimps.

16:55.240 --> 16:57.660
I feel like that's what people are saying about us.

16:58.370 --> 16:59.500
What was that?!

16:59.500 --> 17:00.370
They heard us?!

17:00.370 --> 17:01.420
No way!

17:01.880 --> 17:03.290
All right, guys.

17:03.290 --> 17:06.050
If we can't stop his spikes, 
then we'll just have to receive them.

17:11.590 --> 17:12.300
It's up!

17:12.800 --> 17:13.510
Hyakuzawa!

17:13.930 --> 17:14.850
We're counting on you!

17:16.100 --> 17:17.930
Not yet! Wait a bit longer!

17:18.600 --> 17:19.890
<i>If a wall doesn't work,</i>

17:22.440 --> 17:23.440
<i>we'll use a plate.</i>

17:24.820 --> 17:26.280
A soft block!

17:27.610 --> 17:29.360
Nice save, Asahi!

17:29.360 --> 17:30.200
Nice, Tanaka!

17:32.530 --> 17:34.160
<i>If it's not a fast attack,</i>

17:35.330 --> 17:36.700
<i>I win!</i>

17:43.170 --> 17:46.130
<i>Spiking isn't all about slamming the ball into the floor.</i>

18:02.640 --> 18:04.610
Karasuno                          Kakugawa

18:02.640 --> 18:04.610
Karasuno                          Kakugawa

18:04.610 --> 18:07.070
All right!

18:07.070 --> 18:10.610
Yes! They won even without the blackbelly lantern!

18:07.440 --> 18:08.940
All right!

18:10.610 --> 18:12.030
<i>Blackbelly lantern?</i>

18:12.030 --> 18:13.990
<i>A wipe?</i>

18:13.990 --> 18:15.240
<i>Was that a fluke,</i>

18:15.820 --> 18:17.160
<i>or was it intentional?</i>

18:19.040 --> 18:22.040
<i>I scored with something other than the fast attack!</i>

18:23.420 --> 18:24.880
You did it, Hinata!

18:24.880 --> 18:26.630
We got past the first round of the prelims!

18:27.840 --> 18:28.880
Inagaki.

18:30.420 --> 18:31.590
Line up, Hinata!

18:30.420 --> 18:32.800
What I said about volleyball being simple...

18:31.590 --> 18:32.800
Oh, right.

18:33.720 --> 18:34.970
I take that back.

18:37.890 --> 18:39.970
Kakugawa's two-meter tall guy

18:40.720 --> 18:43.770
is going to be really scary next year.

18:48.690 --> 18:51.360
Kiyoko, we'll carry all the bags!

18:51.940 --> 18:53.900
Most of the stuff has already been taken care of.

18:54.740 --> 18:56.740
Hey, let's go, guys.

18:56.740 --> 19:00.330
Oh, I'll go check to see if we've forgotten anything.

19:00.330 --> 19:02.040
You go on ahead, Hitoka.

19:02.040 --> 19:02.830
Roger!

19:03.500 --> 19:07.790
Jeez. You've gotten good at attacking, but your receives are still so shitty.

19:08.170 --> 19:10.340
What the hell was that weird noise you made?

19:10.340 --> 19:12.210
Th-The ball went up though, right?

19:14.010 --> 19:18.850
That reminds me. You guys finished all
 your summer vacation homework, right?

19:20.510 --> 19:23.100
You remember how I said I wasn't gonna help you, right?

19:23.100 --> 19:23.730
Right?

19:24.350 --> 19:26.440
Ennoshita sure is scary.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.610
Is something wrong, Hinata?

19:30.610 --> 19:35.650
With this win, we finally stand in the same ring as the Great King and Ushiwaka Japan!

19:38.700 --> 19:39.530
Huh?!

19:39.530 --> 19:41.370
I forgot my lunchbox!

19:43.410 --> 19:45.500
C'mon, just gimme your number!

19:45.500 --> 19:46.330
Sorry, but I can't.

19:47.500 --> 19:50.040
<i>Whoa, she's getting hit on!</i>

19:48.750 --> 19:50.420
Sorry, I have people waiting for me.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.880
<i>Not to mention, they're scary looking!</i>

19:50.420 --> 19:52.710
It'll only take a second.

19:53.090 --> 19:55.920
<i>And Tanaka and Noya already left!</i>

19:56.430 --> 19:57.680
I'm sorry.

19:57.680 --> 19:59.930
Well, I'll just get it from your phone real quick.

20:00.550 --> 20:01.640
Whoa!

20:04.810 --> 20:07.890
Sorry! That's my lunchbox!

20:07.890 --> 20:09.770
Let's go! Hurry!

20:08.810 --> 20:09.770
Wait up!

20:10.810 --> 20:12.150
We were still talking.

20:12.150 --> 20:13.190
Hinata!

20:13.190 --> 20:14.990
Got a smartphone? Or are you still using a flip phone?

20:15.440 --> 20:17.400
Excuse me!

20:17.820 --> 20:19.490
<i>What's with the springs on this kid?!</i>

20:22.120 --> 20:22.160
Karasuno

20:22.160 --> 20:22.200
Karasuno

20:22.200 --> 20:22.240
Karasuno

20:22.240 --> 20:22.280
Karasuno

20:22.280 --> 20:22.330
Karasuno

20:22.330 --> 20:24.330
<b>Karasuno</b>

20:23.120 --> 20:24.330
Karasuno...

20:25.200 --> 20:29.790
Sh-Shimizu is our manager and 
very important to us, so um... um...

20:29.080 --> 20:29.790
Well now...

20:30.290 --> 20:33.090
So you guys beat the two-meter tall guy, huh?

20:33.090 --> 20:35.510
What? Uh, I mean, we did, but...

20:36.010 --> 20:41.010
Man, I really wanted to play that two-meter tall guy.

20:41.010 --> 20:41.970
Play?

20:42.720 --> 20:45.180
Matches are super fun, aren't they?

20:45.770 --> 20:49.060
Um, are you one of the teams that got past the prelims?

20:49.060 --> 20:50.350
Prelims?

20:50.350 --> 20:52.900
We didn't play in the prelims.

20:52.900 --> 20:56.400
Huh? You made the quarterfinals in the interhigh prelims?

20:56.400 --> 20:58.650
Yeah. Or maybe it was the semis...

20:58.650 --> 21:01.110
S-Semis?!

21:01.110 --> 21:01.870
See ya.

21:02.570 --> 21:05.410
If we happen to meet in the decider tournament,

21:06.040 --> 21:07.750
let's have a fun match.

21:09.540 --> 21:11.830
Have a fun match...

21:12.170 --> 21:16.210
Oh, so Kiyo... Shimizu's number
 isn't something he needs anymore.

21:16.210 --> 21:17.340
That's good.

21:18.010 --> 21:21.550
Looks like you got his attention, Hinata.

21:22.140 --> 21:23.720
Sorry about that.

21:23.720 --> 21:25.010
Thank you, though.

21:25.010 --> 21:26.430
Here. You forgot this.

21:28.100 --> 21:30.730
That cloth around your lunchbox is cute.

21:30.730 --> 21:31.230
Cu—

21:31.230 --> 21:34.360
Th-This is Natsu's... my little sister's!

21:34.360 --> 21:35.770
I-It's definitely not mine!

21:38.900 --> 21:41.150
Doesn't it feel like Kiyoko's been gone a while?

21:41.150 --> 21:42.110
Want to go check on her?

21:52.460 --> 21:54.920
What the hell are you lookin' at...

22:03.470 --> 22:04.720
Sorry to keep you waiting!

22:04.720 --> 22:06.140
You're late, moron!

22:06.140 --> 22:09.020
Thank goodness you're safe, Kiyoko!

22:09.020 --> 22:10.390
Was anything left behind?

22:10.390 --> 22:12.770
Oh, there was a cutely wrapped—

22:12.770 --> 22:14.770
You don't have to tell them!

22:16.150 --> 22:16.150
{ED}

22:29.080 --> 22:34.620
We climb the mountain in our way

22:35.170 --> 22:41.210
Losing more than just time in the process

22:41.210 --> 22:47.220
Tasting freedom makes us want to fly

22:47.350 --> 22:53.270
And notice the feelings welling up inside

22:53.560 --> 22:56.690
It's almost in our reach

22:56.690 --> 22:59.770
The closer we get, the more it shines

22:59.770 --> 23:02.570
And stretches out in front of our eyes

23:02.570 --> 23:05.950
That panorama created just for us

23:05.950 --> 23:12.200
Until I reach the top and come back down, my lungs will keep breathing

23:12.200 --> 23:18.460
But now I've been possessed by the desire to climb that summit once again

23:18.460 --> 23:24.300
We cast aside all our doubt and set flight to the skies

23:24.300 --> 23:31.470
Our flailing hands reach out and grab hold of the moment

23:32.850 --> 23:34.480
That special moment

23:35.940 --> 23:40.440
Come to us climbers

23:40.980 --> 23:43.190
Come to us right now

23:46.110 --> 23:46.110
{Preview}

23:46.950 --> 23:48.990
<i>Someone tried to hit on Kiyoko?!</i>

23:48.990 --> 23:50.620
<i>We need to get our act together!</i>

23:50.620 --> 23:53.410
<i>Don't let her out of our sight from now on! 
We'll even take turns going to the bathroom!</i>

23:53.410 --> 23:53.910
<i>Yeah!</i>

23:53.910 --> 23:57.620
<i>The harder they try, the farther Shimizu's heart drifts away from them.</i>

23:57.420 --> 24:01.130
Episode Fourteen: 
Growing Fast

23:57.420 --> 24:01.130
Episode Fourteen: 
Growing Fast

23:57.620 --> 23:58.120
<i>Huh?</i>

23:58.120 --> 23:59.210
<i>Next time on </i>Haikyuu!!<i>:</i>

23:59.210 --> 24:00.380
<i>"Growing Fast."</i>
