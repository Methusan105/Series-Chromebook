Let's have a good match!

00:12.430 --> 00:13.660
Yeah.

00:13.660 --> 00:16.510
Now, now. Don't be so tense.

00:16.510 --> 00:18.620
You guys still have next year.

00:19.580 --> 00:21.080
That's irrelevant.

00:21.080 --> 00:25.080
Your reputation or status doesn't matter once you're on the court.

00:25.360 --> 00:27.120
I know, right?

00:27.790 --> 00:29.830
Heads is Seijou, tails is Date Tech.

00:29.830 --> 00:32.180

00:32.180 --> 00:34.140

00:34.140 --> 00:37.470

00:41.740 --> 00:43.690
All right!

<i>It's that simple.</i>

00:52.450 --> 00:56.660

01:23.230 --> 01:27.350
They just want to see the ends of the ocean

01:27.780 --> 01:32.360
Empty your mind

01:32.360 --> 01:37.950
Let the headwinds guide your approach

01:37.950 --> 01:40.070
And with a hop, step, and a jump

01:40.950 --> 01:44.080
Leap and fly! High!

01:44.080 --> 01:48.770
Let your wings, glistening with blood, sweat, and tears

01:48.770 --> 01:51.380
Take you to wherever you need to go

01:51.380 --> 01:54.170
Unleash your unrefined impulses

01:54.170 --> 01:57.180
Uncover your instincts and bare your uncut fangs

01:57.180 --> 01:59.050
It may take an arduous path

01:59.050 --> 02:01.260
But be torn down it endlessly to achieve your dream

02:01.260 --> 02:04.270
So just fly

02:06.480 --> 02:09.440
Fly high

02:09.440 --> 02:12.560

The Losers

02:23.160 --> 02:24.240
It's going out of bounds!

02:26.600 --> 02:28.080
Shake it off! Focus on the next one!

02:28.080 --> 02:29.330
My bad!

02:30.960 --> 02:35.800
<i>I haven't even hit that many spikes, 
yet I've managed to mess up three this set.</i>

02:35.800 --> 02:38.510
Waku South                   Karasuno

02:35.800 --> 02:38.510
Waku South                   Karasuno

02:36.930 --> 02:38.510
Man, what's wrong with him?

02:38.970 --> 02:42.470
I think it's partially due to him not used to being on the right side.

02:42.760 --> 02:46.930
But the biggest factor is probably the pressure he's under.

02:42.760 --> 02:43.760
One point at a time!

02:53.040 --> 02:54.030
Got it.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.610
I touched it!

02:58.990 --> 03:01.200
<i>Damn, they're actually pretty good.</i>

03:01.200 --> 03:03.160
Waku South                      Karasuno

03:01.200 --> 03:03.160
Waku South                      Karasuno

03:03.160 --> 03:05.020
All right!

03:06.260 --> 03:09.120
Waku South's Nakashima seems to really be in the groove now.

03:09.850 --> 03:13.190
On the other hand, it seems like Karasuno is struggling with that.

03:14.150 --> 03:14.920
Hey!

03:16.040 --> 03:18.550
You got a look on your face like the world's going to end.

03:18.550 --> 03:20.200
It's too early for the world to end.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.220
I'm the Earth Defense Force!

03:22.220 --> 03:24.550
I do <i>not</i> look like that!

03:24.550 --> 03:27.730
All right! Chikara's back in action!

03:30.100 --> 03:34.230
Not much you can do if you get completely blown away, but there are still some balls that you can dig out!

03:30.500 --> 03:32.470
<i>Calm down.</i>

03:32.470 --> 03:35.300
<i>I can't keep dwelling on it.</i>

03:35.300 --> 03:37.910
<i>I've gotta do this! Like Daichi would!</i>

03:35.300 --> 03:37.910
You're landing a lot of your attacks. Keep it going!

03:37.910 --> 03:38.940
Yes, sir!

03:38.940 --> 03:40.760
Coach!

03:40.760 --> 03:41.400
Huh?

03:41.900 --> 03:46.620
So the Little Giant was like Waku South's number one?

03:47.070 --> 03:51.640
Well, the way he plays is probably the closest in the prefecture.

03:54.080 --> 03:56.830
Hey, don't try to compete with him.

03:56.830 --> 04:00.000
He's better in mid-air battles than you are.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.300
Just play like you usually do.

04:01.300 --> 04:05.230
Why are you always such a buzzkill?!

04:05.230 --> 04:07.090
That was just some kind advice!

04:07.090 --> 04:08.510
You call that kind?!

04:08.510 --> 04:11.070
I know that he's good!

04:08.510 --> 04:11.070
H-Hinata, calm down...

04:11.070 --> 04:13.480
That's why I'm trying to figure out what to do!

04:13.480 --> 04:15.600
You don't have a brain, so don't even bother trying.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.440
What was that?!

04:17.440 --> 04:19.400
Waku South                         Karasuno

04:17.440 --> 04:19.400
Waku South                         Karasuno

04:19.760 --> 04:20.610
Takeru!

04:22.070 --> 04:24.150
That was a really risky straight spike!

04:24.150 --> 04:25.280
He's so good!

04:25.280 --> 04:26.990
Nice spike!

04:28.030 --> 04:30.950
<i>You aren't even 170 cm tall.</i>

04:31.600 --> 04:35.670
<i>I can't deny your skills, but I'm not going to lose to you.</i>

04:31.600 --> 04:33.620
Give us another good serve, Tabi!

04:33.620 --> 04:35.670
Yeah, leave it to me!

04:36.610 --> 04:39.880
I'm <i>going to surpass the Little Giant, not you!</i>

04:39.880 --> 04:41.590
Waku South

04:39.880 --> 04:41.590
Waku South

04:41.590 --> 04:42.780
Give us a good serve!

04:44.990 --> 04:45.680
Crap!

04:47.120 --> 04:48.820
Hinata, it's all yours!

04:48.820 --> 04:49.760
Yeah!

04:50.760 --> 04:53.180
<i>I'm going to go for a wipe.</i>

04:57.280 --> 04:59.020
He really hit that one out of the park.

04:59.020 --> 05:00.320
I'm sorry!

04:59.980 --> 05:05.490
As Kageyama said, Nakashima is clearly better right now on an individual level.

05:00.320 --> 05:01.650
It's fine!

05:01.650 --> 05:03.470
I told you not to try to compete with him, moron!

05:07.700 --> 05:09.860
Do it one more time, Tabi!

05:11.410 --> 05:12.670
Got it!

05:18.140 --> 05:19.170
<i>I hit it right at him.</i>

05:19.170 --> 05:20.630
All right, we dug it out!

05:21.840 --> 05:23.180
Two blockers!

05:24.340 --> 05:25.760
Damn, not again!

05:29.550 --> 05:30.100
So fast!

05:30.830 --> 05:31.390
Look out!

05:38.900 --> 05:40.440
Counterattack!

05:41.090 --> 05:45.610
<i>Your skills are no match for Nakashima's or the Little Giant's right now.</i>

05:46.140 --> 05:46.740
<i>But...</i>

05:49.500 --> 05:52.020
<i>you can still fight with everything you've learned!</i>

05:55.870 --> 05:57.210
Yeah!

05:59.000 --> 05:59.960
Are you all right?!

06:00.310 --> 06:02.120
I got overexcited.

06:02.120 --> 06:04.630
Be careful! Seriously, be careful!

06:04.630 --> 06:06.910
Bumping into a guy this light is nothing.

06:10.660 --> 06:12.640
That spike was awesome!

06:13.100 --> 06:17.600
Even if we're backed into a corner, we still have 
the firepower to push through. That's our weapon.

06:18.560 --> 06:21.070
<i>Kageyama actually said something decent!</i>

06:21.070 --> 06:24.850
I think you said something like that once.

06:24.850 --> 06:26.530
<i>Oh, that's right.</i>

06:28.950 --> 06:30.030
Yeah.

06:30.490 --> 06:33.750
S-Sorry, sir. Are you all right?

06:33.750 --> 06:35.450
I got knocked flat on my back.

06:36.120 --> 06:39.830
It's hard to believe he used to struggle with diving receives after that one.

06:40.130 --> 06:41.210
Yeah.

06:41.210 --> 06:43.750
Let's see your killer serve!

06:43.750 --> 06:47.420
<i>Their number ten has amazing reflexes and mobility.</i>

06:47.420 --> 06:49.380
Waku South

06:47.420 --> 06:49.380
Waku South

06:48.640 --> 06:49.380
Shiro!

06:52.300 --> 06:53.510
A tip!

06:55.720 --> 06:56.920
Nice receive!

06:58.430 --> 06:59.720
Let it go!

07:02.500 --> 07:04.360
Sorry for the low set!

07:05.150 --> 07:08.890
<i>I could see the tip coming, but I started moving too late.</i>

07:08.890 --> 07:12.570
<i>Daichi would've been able to get that ball to the setter properly.</i>

07:13.590 --> 07:14.670
I'm sorry.

07:18.460 --> 07:20.430
Why are you saying sorry?

07:25.380 --> 07:29.520
You're about ten years away from being able to do what Daichi...

07:30.150 --> 07:31.330
No, that's too long.

07:32.830 --> 07:34.220
You're about a year away from that!

07:34.620 --> 07:37.930
That just now was a good receive, no matter what anyone says!

07:43.170 --> 07:46.480
Let's not mention any realistic numbers like "one year."

07:46.900 --> 07:48.860
Karasuno

07:46.900 --> 07:48.860
Karasuno

07:51.030 --> 07:51.990
Someone get it!

07:51.990 --> 07:52.950
Takeru!

07:57.890 --> 07:59.580
All right!

07:58.800 --> 07:59.580
Damn it!

07:59.580 --> 08:04.040
It's gonna be rough if they can't do something about that wipe.

08:00.320 --> 08:01.680
You nearly got it! Don't worry!

08:07.290 --> 08:10.410
<i>I don't have the time to wallow in my failures right now.</i>

08:10.410 --> 08:14.010
<i>Playing on par with Daichi just isn't possible for me as things stand.</i>

08:14.620 --> 08:17.020
<i>I know that he's good!</i>

08:17.020 --> 08:19.270
<i>That's why I'm trying to figure out what to do!</i>

08:22.360 --> 08:24.050
Hey, can I have a moment?

08:25.860 --> 08:29.900
When their number one goes for a wipe,
 I'll chase after the ball.

08:30.900 --> 08:34.200
Tanaka and Asahi, you two are way better at digging out powerful spikes than I am.

08:34.560 --> 08:37.010
So I want you two to defend against straight spikes,

08:37.010 --> 08:40.570
and I'll stay back in the middle to try to get any balls that go that way.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.650
I can't guarantee that it'll work, but...

08:44.650 --> 08:46.600
Yeah, let's give it a shot.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.040
Th-Thank you very much!

08:52.040 --> 08:55.300
Can I dig out powerful spikes better than Ennoshita?

08:56.930 --> 08:58.140
Got it!

09:02.190 --> 09:03.310
All right!

09:05.260 --> 09:06.230
Takeru!

09:06.230 --> 09:06.970
Yeah!

09:06.970 --> 09:07.940
Two blockers!

09:13.850 --> 09:15.330
I can't guarantee that it'll work, but...

09:15.330 --> 09:17.530
Yeah, let's give it a shot.

09:18.860 --> 09:20.740
<i>If I can't save this...</i>

09:23.010 --> 09:25.500
<i>I don't deserve to stand on this court!</i>

09:28.420 --> 09:30.630
Ennoshita!

09:30.630 --> 09:31.590
Damn...

09:32.810 --> 09:33.780
<i>Make it!</i>

09:35.300 --> 09:42.060

09:35.300 --> 09:42.060

Ennoshita!

09:57.200 --> 09:58.160
Damn...

09:59.820 --> 10:01.330
Hinata, it's all yours!

10:01.330 --> 10:02.830
Three blockers!

10:07.250 --> 10:09.580
<i>If I just spike it, they'll block it.</i>

10:10.250 --> 10:11.540
<i>Let's regroup.</i>

10:15.980 --> 10:16.880
<i>He...</i>

10:16.880 --> 10:17.630
All right!

10:17.630 --> 10:18.680
Got it!

10:19.380 --> 10:22.610
What? Did he hit the block on purpose?

10:22.610 --> 10:23.890
That was a rebound.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.560
When did he learn that?

10:26.100 --> 10:27.980
During the summer training camp.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.980
But that was pure luck.

10:31.980 --> 10:33.400
Let me have another shot!

10:35.000 --> 10:38.700
<i>With Daichi absent, our defense is weaker than usual.</i>

10:39.320 --> 10:40.910
<i>Whether intentionally or not,</i>

10:40.910 --> 10:43.620
Bring it!

10:41.790 --> 10:44.870
<i>Hinata's trying to deal with this situation.</i>

10:53.290 --> 10:55.630
That was awesome, Hinata!

10:57.060 --> 10:59.740
I feel like someone's complimenting me!

10:59.740 --> 11:01.180
That'd never happen.

11:02.300 --> 11:04.140
Where'd you learn that?!

11:04.730 --> 11:07.140
Actually, Bokuto taught me it during the training camp.

11:05.030 --> 11:09.100
<i>I knew that Karasuno had an amazing short guy,</i>

11:07.140 --> 11:09.100
What? No fair!

11:09.100 --> 11:11.600
You lucky bastard!

11:09.810 --> 11:14.110
<i>but I thought that was only because of the setter.</i>

11:11.600 --> 11:13.110
You should've told me earlier!

11:14.110 --> 11:15.020
<i>And yet...</i>

11:15.570 --> 11:18.620
Good job, Hinata, Tanaka!

11:18.620 --> 11:19.530
Chikara!

11:21.270 --> 11:22.820
Nice receive.

11:30.160 --> 11:33.100
That's no fair, Noya.

11:33.100 --> 11:37.130
Getting a compliment from him about a receive would cheer anyone up.

11:37.670 --> 11:38.800
He's in.

11:39.580 --> 11:40.340
Pardon?

11:40.750 --> 11:47.770
He's just a substitute, and he can't completely blend 
in with the vibe on the court since he doesn't belong.

11:47.770 --> 11:51.310
I think that's how Ennoshita used to feel.

11:51.310 --> 11:54.940
But I think the last play took care of that.

11:54.940 --> 11:56.520
How so?

11:57.110 --> 12:01.700
He came up with the plan,
 told the rest of the team, and then executed it.

12:02.030 --> 12:04.510
That sort of thing builds confidence.

12:04.510 --> 12:05.990
I see.

12:16.700 --> 12:18.050
It's difficult.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.510
All right!

12:24.650 --> 12:31.390
<i>Until recently, Karasuno was an 
average team that didn't stand out.</i>

12:32.310 --> 12:34.400
He's the Little Giant!

12:35.020 --> 12:40.860
<i>Back when I first started to worry about my height, 
that match showed me there was a path I could take.</i>

12:36.110 --> 12:37.500
He aimed that spike perfectly!

12:37.500 --> 12:39.730
He has amazing vision!

12:41.580 --> 12:43.480
<i>Karasuno's number ten.</i>

12:43.480 --> 12:46.820
<i>He bears the same number on his back that the Little Giant did.</i>

12:44.360 --> 12:45.410
One more!

12:47.140 --> 12:47.780
Takeru!

12:48.280 --> 12:51.200
<i>I'll start by defeating you!</i>

12:48.280 --> 12:49.990
Number one is doing a back row attack!

12:57.500 --> 12:57.540
{=1}Waku South

12:58.460 --> 13:00.500
Sorry, the set was low.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.460
Give us a good serve, Ennoshita!

13:02.970 --> 13:04.430
Got it!

13:06.390 --> 13:08.120
Nice!

13:06.390 --> 13:08.120
All right!

13:08.120 --> 13:09.560
Thank goodness.

13:09.560 --> 13:13.770
Even though you're older than Takeru, sometimes it feels like the reverse.

13:13.770 --> 13:15.350
You're gonna make me cry!

13:15.350 --> 13:17.810
Karasuno                       Waku South

13:15.350 --> 13:17.810
Karasuno                       Waku South

13:15.850 --> 13:17.810
Give us a good one, Asahi!

13:23.650 --> 13:24.950
Sorry! I hit it too far!

13:25.290 --> 13:26.410
It's going over the net!

13:26.410 --> 13:27.320
Takeru!

13:26.410 --> 13:28.370
Kageyama, push it over!

13:31.780 --> 13:34.500
<i>It's at times like this that I'm painfully reminded</i>

13:35.460 --> 13:37.040
<i>of the wall called height.</i>

13:39.250 --> 13:40.960
Nice save, Tabi!

13:40.960 --> 13:42.590
Keep it going!

13:41.890 --> 13:44.920
<i>Karasuno's number ten, I won't lose to you!</i>

13:44.920 --> 13:45.880
Takeru!

13:45.880 --> 13:47.340
<i>I won't lose,</i>

13:47.840 --> 13:49.550
<i>and neither will my teammates' bravery!</i>

13:51.110 --> 13:52.770
All right!

13:52.770 --> 13:54.980
Karasuno                   Waku South

13:52.770 --> 13:54.980
Karasuno                   Waku South

13:57.940 --> 13:59.520
Hang in there.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.660
If you keep it up, they'll start making mistakes.

14:02.660 --> 14:05.270
On top of that, they're missing their captain.

14:05.270 --> 14:07.480
Hang in there until they crack.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.240
Yes, sir!

14:08.240 --> 14:09.200
Lastly,

14:09.660 --> 14:14.620
go show them who's really the Little Giant in this match.

14:16.870 --> 14:17.620
Yes, sir!

14:18.330 --> 14:22.290
Waku South

14:18.330 --> 14:22.290
Waku South

14:21.000 --> 14:22.290
Hinata, your serve!

14:22.290 --> 14:23.540
Right!

14:23.540 --> 14:25.010
Mr. Ukai...

14:25.010 --> 14:25.760
Huh?

14:26.150 --> 14:31.170
He was saying that it might be better to start giving sets to Azumane since the match is almost over.

14:31.170 --> 14:32.140
Right.

14:35.270 --> 14:36.640
Watch for a fast attack!

14:37.600 --> 14:39.060
Nice receive!

14:41.730 --> 14:46.610
<i>Now that Hinata's in the back row, 
they're definitely going to be cautious of Azumane.</i>

14:46.610 --> 14:49.700
<i>The best time to set the ball to him...</i>

14:50.570 --> 14:51.370
<i>should be...</i>

14:51.700 --> 14:52.870
<i>right now!</i>

14:54.740 --> 14:56.290
All right!

14:55.380 --> 14:56.910
<i>It's in bounds! Thank goodness.</i>

14:57.330 --> 14:58.460
Chikara!

14:57.330 --> 15:02.170
<i>Even though the match is on the line,
 he set it to someone who hasn't gotten many spikes off.</i>

14:58.460 --> 15:00.120
Nice spike, Ennoshita!

15:02.170 --> 15:05.300
<i>That first-year setter is definitely gutsy.</i>

15:05.810 --> 15:09.260
Damn, I'm not sure if I should be happy about this or not.

15:09.260 --> 15:10.720
Karasuno

15:09.260 --> 15:10.720
Karasuno

15:10.270 --> 15:12.430
Give us a good one, Asahi!

15:12.430 --> 15:14.330
Give 'em a fierce one!

15:14.330 --> 15:16.350
Finish the match off in one go!

15:19.560 --> 15:20.600
It's out!

15:22.440 --> 15:24.150
All right!

15:24.150 --> 15:24.980
Nice eye!

15:24.980 --> 15:25.730
I'm sor—

15:26.600 --> 15:28.190
Let's get the next one!

15:28.190 --> 15:29.900
Karasuno                   Waku South

15:28.190 --> 15:29.900
Karasuno                   Waku South

15:30.190 --> 15:31.930
<i>Don't look at the score...</i>

15:30.190 --> 15:31.930
Give us a good serve, Matsushima!

15:31.930 --> 15:34.120
<i>Calm down. Stay calm.</i>

15:35.830 --> 15:37.040
<i>Oh crap!</i>

15:37.040 --> 15:38.660
Let it go!

15:38.660 --> 15:39.750
Nice call!

15:41.930 --> 15:42.770
I-I'm sor—

15:42.770 --> 15:44.230
Okay, let's change gears!

15:44.230 --> 15:45.710
There's no problem if we get the next one!

15:46.070 --> 15:47.170
Hey, Matsushima!

15:47.640 --> 15:51.720
If you're still depressed when you rotate back to the front row, I'm gonna make you buy me a popsicle!

15:53.140 --> 15:53.720
Right!

15:53.720 --> 15:56.680
Karasuno                     Waku South

15:53.720 --> 15:56.680
Karasuno                     Waku South

15:54.100 --> 15:56.170
Karasuno's at match point.

15:56.170 --> 15:59.830
And here comes Karasuno's number ten again.

15:59.830 --> 16:01.390
Waku South's in trouble.

16:03.100 --> 16:04.190
Got it!

16:10.490 --> 16:12.200
All right!

16:10.860 --> 16:13.050
They targeted the spot Yuu left open?

16:13.050 --> 16:14.200
They're calm.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.870
You can do this, Kawatabi!

16:15.870 --> 16:17.370
Tabi, get this one!

16:16.500 --> 16:19.160
<i>If I mess this up, it's all over.</i>

16:19.470 --> 16:22.160
You'll look really cool if you hit this one as hard as you can.

16:33.510 --> 16:35.470
It's up! Nice job, Nishinoya!

16:35.470 --> 16:36.640
<i>It's in a bad location!</i>

16:35.980 --> 16:37.260
Kageyama!

16:36.640 --> 16:38.220
<i>But a fast attack is still possible!</i>

16:37.260 --> 16:38.220
Got it!

16:38.220 --> 16:40.390
<i>Or should I let Tanaka have it?</i>

16:40.390 --> 16:43.190
<i>No, a fast attack can make it!</i>

16:45.770 --> 16:47.230
<i>It's a bit high?</i>

16:49.650 --> 16:50.530
<i>They rushed it!</i>

16:50.980 --> 16:53.970
<i>Hang in there until they crack.</i>

16:53.970 --> 16:55.280
Here's our chance!

16:54.360 --> 16:55.910
Hinata!

16:57.620 --> 16:58.870
Don't flail about!

16:59.480 --> 17:00.890
A good jump...

17:02.600 --> 17:04.040
...starts with a good approach!

17:05.500 --> 17:10.460
<i>At this point, we no longer have the advantage of Karasuno's captain being absent.</i>

17:10.880 --> 17:12.170
Eye on the ball!

17:12.170 --> 17:12.920
Yeah.

17:22.140 --> 17:23.600
<i>It's too late!</i>

17:55.300 --> 17:56.050
All...

17:56.590 --> 17:59.090
...right!

18:02.850 --> 18:06.060
Karasuno                   Waku South

18:02.850 --> 18:06.060
Karasuno                   Waku South

18:03.510 --> 18:05.640
Thank you for the match!

18:09.650 --> 18:10.520
What?

18:12.230 --> 18:15.690
I couldn't beat their number one head-to-head.

18:16.650 --> 18:18.670
He was more like the Little Giant than I was.

18:19.950 --> 18:23.660
Of course. You're not even good enough to shine the Little Giant's shoes, you moron.

18:25.580 --> 18:27.870
Hey! What are you guys doing?!

18:28.580 --> 18:30.830
Come on, line up!

18:31.890 --> 18:32.790
Bow.

18:33.250 --> 18:36.260
Thank you very much!

18:39.130 --> 18:41.300
You fought hard, Takeru!

18:44.890 --> 18:46.320
<i>Today was just our second match.</i>

18:46.320 --> 18:48.810
<i>Our next opponent will be even harder.</i>

18:48.810 --> 18:49.900
Daichi!

18:53.230 --> 18:56.670
Uh, um...

18:57.900 --> 18:58.950
I'm sorry.

18:59.970 --> 19:02.320
D-D-D...

19:02.320 --> 19:04.790
Daichi!

19:05.120 --> 19:07.510
D-Daichi! A-Are...

19:07.510 --> 19:08.910
I'm fine.

19:08.910 --> 19:12.750
No, seriously. I got some rest.
 I actually feel better than before the match.

19:13.830 --> 19:16.210
I'll work twice as hard in the next match.

19:18.950 --> 19:21.700
You guys must be exhausted from playing all three sets.

19:21.700 --> 19:23.640
Come on, rest.

19:23.640 --> 19:27.060
Oh, our next opponent's playing right now.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.850
I was watching from around the 20-point mark.

19:33.270 --> 19:36.230
At first, I thought I needed to get back out there soon as possible.

19:37.190 --> 19:41.910
But when I actually saw you guys in action, I knew everything would be okay.

19:42.420 --> 19:45.620
I even felt like I'd ruin the rhythm you guys had if I went back out.

19:46.940 --> 19:50.250
Good job with that last receive, Ennoshita.

19:52.380 --> 19:53.230
Right.

19:57.920 --> 19:58.670
Sorry.

19:59.690 --> 20:01.260
Could you go on ahead?

20:03.260 --> 20:06.590
Doesn't Ennoshita seem a bit down considering we won?

20:06.590 --> 20:07.220
Yeah.

20:11.810 --> 20:14.660
<i>I messed up half the spikes I hit,</i>

20:14.660 --> 20:17.570
<i>and I only made some real receives in the second half of the match.</i>

20:18.440 --> 20:22.620
<i>But for the first time, I felt like I left it all on the court.</i>

20:22.620 --> 20:23.360
<i>So why...</i>

20:24.950 --> 20:26.830
<i>Why am I so relieved?!</i>

20:27.250 --> 20:31.200
<i>I should be getting ready to take on whoever we end up playing next!</i>

20:31.200 --> 20:33.290
<i>I'm such a goddamn idiot!</i>

20:39.470 --> 20:40.590
That was amazing!

20:40.590 --> 20:42.470
I was watching the last bit with Sawamura!

20:42.470 --> 20:44.820
We're gonna win the next match too!

20:47.470 --> 20:50.100
Doesn't Yamaguchi seem down?

20:52.060 --> 20:52.890
Sorry.

20:53.660 --> 20:55.350
I'm gonna go to the bathroom,

20:55.660 --> 20:57.560
so go on ahead without me.

20:59.150 --> 21:01.900
He's really pumped about going to the bathroom.

21:01.900 --> 21:02.990
He must need to shit.

21:02.990 --> 21:05.760
Say "poop"! You're so vulgar, Kageyama!

21:05.760 --> 21:08.190
I don't think he's actually going to the bathroom.

21:12.150 --> 21:15.000
Hey, Takeru. It's time for the meeting.

21:16.250 --> 21:17.550
You know...

21:17.550 --> 21:18.620
Huh?

21:18.620 --> 21:20.550
The end happened in slow motion.

21:22.010 --> 21:24.370
I locked eyes with number ten.

21:24.970 --> 21:31.100
I could tell that he figured out where I was aiming for.

21:32.060 --> 21:34.430
That was the first time I was able to see it so clearly.

21:35.500 --> 21:36.940
It gave me goosebumps.

21:39.650 --> 21:40.940
Let me...

21:42.000 --> 21:44.910
Let me have another chance!

21:51.120 --> 21:55.660
Aoba Jousai

21:51.120 --> 21:55.660
Aoba Jousai

21:52.540 --> 21:57.750
Attack! Attack, attack, attack, attack, Seijou!

21:52.540 --> 22:02.590
Go, go, let's go! Let's go, Date Tech!

21:55.660 --> 21:59.130
<b>Rule the Court</b>

21:55.660 --> 21:59.130
<b>Rule the Court</b>

21:57.750 --> 22:02.590
Work it, work it, work it, Seijou!

21:59.130 --> 22:02.590
<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

21:59.130 --> 22:02.590
<b>The Iron Wall of Date</b>

22:04.380 --> 22:06.300
Hey, don't eat too much.

22:07.890 --> 22:09.390
Now...

22:09.780 --> 22:13.100
let's see who our next opponent will be.

22:15.020 --> 22:15.020
{ED}

22:27.240 --> 22:31.370
When I was just a nobody, something lit up my eyes

22:31.370 --> 22:37.170
I was merely a guy languishing complacently in the dark, happy with what I had

22:31.370 --> 22:37.170
I was merely a guy languishing complacently in the dark, happy with what I had

22:37.170 --> 22:41.590
Now I'm torn toward the heavens even on a starless night

22:41.590 --> 22:46.640
Whether our time comes to us or not is a matter for those in another world

22:46.670 --> 22:56.850
That's right, our lungs pumping and our hearts beating is all we have in this new realm

22:46.670 --> 22:56.850
That's right, our lungs pumping and our hearts beating is all we have in this new realm

22:56.850 --> 23:01.980
We've always been dancing on an unlit stage, but now beyond that

23:01.980 --> 23:08.780
We're awaiting the rising of a sun that none have yet witnessed

23:08.780 --> 23:14.700
Now that we're deliberating at a crossroads, paths blurring together

23:08.780 --> 23:14.700
Now that we're deliberating at a crossroads, paths blurring together

23:15.250 --> 23:17.330
We can feel it

23:15.250 --> 23:17.330
We can feel it

23:17.330 --> 23:22.460
Inside this uncharted world which has yet to take on a name

I'm reminded of days I won't return to, and seeking proof of newfound existence

23:35.640 --> 23:38.480
We brace ourselves

<i>Lately, I've been conflicted as a coach because everyone's doing so well.</i>

23:50.010 --> 23:52.530
<i>And Nishinoya keeps scolding me.</i>

<i>Wanna join me?</i>

23:53.880 --> 23:55.910
<i>Uh, I'm a minor!</i>

<i>Next time on </i>Haikyuu!!<i>:</i>
