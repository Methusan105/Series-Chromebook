00:05.970 --> 00:07.650
Be sure you make yourself heard!

00:07.650 --> 00:08.610
Yessir!

00:08.610 --> 00:10.110
Yeah!

00:12.170 --> 00:14.910
Karasuno definitely seems different.

00:14.910 --> 00:16.070
Excuse us!

00:16.530 --> 00:17.160
Oh?

00:24.050 --> 00:25.670
Well, well...

00:25.670 --> 00:29.630
If it isn't Tobio, the little boy I gave a good whipping the last time we met.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.920
We've come to win this time.

00:31.920 --> 00:35.600
I definitively put you in your place last time!

00:35.600 --> 00:38.260
All that's left is that bastard, Ushiwaka!

00:38.890 --> 00:41.270
I will have you stand aside again, Tobio!

00:43.770 --> 00:45.350
Take that!

00:46.100 --> 00:48.480
Is he really a third-year?

00:49.270 --> 00:52.070
It's way too early to let Oikawa get to him.

00:57.700 --> 00:58.910
Hey.

00:58.910 --> 00:59.580
Yes?

01:00.330 --> 01:02.160
Karasuno's got another girl.

01:02.160 --> 01:03.040
Sorry, Yachi!

01:03.040 --> 01:04.000
She's a cutie.

01:04.710 --> 01:05.460
Here.

01:06.170 --> 01:09.710
Yeah. I wonder why I'm so frustrated by that.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.130
All right.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.090
Pardon me.

01:16.820 --> 01:18.930
Could you get that?

01:20.810 --> 01:22.180
Damn it! Look out!

01:30.270 --> 01:31.710
<i>Holy crap...</i>

01:32.360 --> 01:33.280
Here.

01:33.280 --> 01:34.240
Thanks...

01:35.700 --> 01:37.450
Damn, it didn't work.

01:37.450 --> 01:39.660
Karasuno's guard is too strong.

01:39.660 --> 01:42.870
You're such a showoff, Yahaba.

01:42.870 --> 01:45.510
Come on! We're about to start warming up!

01:46.250 --> 01:47.330
Ow.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.260
A-Are you okay?

01:58.930 --> 02:00.000
Kageyama.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.720
Huh?

02:01.680 --> 02:04.060
Was that guy on Seijou's team before?

02:04.060 --> 02:05.020
Dunno.

02:06.980 --> 02:06.980
{OP}

02:07.360 --> 02:10.360
Leap and fly! High!

02:10.360 --> 02:13.410
Flecked with blood, sweat, and tears

02:13.410 --> 02:17.620
Those glistening wings can let you leave it all behind

02:17.620 --> 02:20.780

02:44.180 --> 02:48.310
They just want to see the ends of the ocean

02:48.730 --> 02:53.320
Empty your mind

02:53.320 --> 02:58.900
Let the headwinds guide your approach

02:58.900 --> 03:01.030
And with a hop, step, and a jump

03:01.910 --> 03:05.030
Leap and fly! High!

03:05.030 --> 03:09.730
Let your wings, glistening with blood, sweat, and tears

03:09.730 --> 03:12.340
Take you to wherever you need to go

03:12.340 --> 03:15.130
Unleash your unrefined impulses

03:15.130 --> 03:18.140
Uncover your instincts and bare your uncut fangs

03:18.140 --> 03:20.010
It may take an arduous path

03:20.010 --> 03:22.220
But be torn down it endlessly to achieve your dream

03:22.220 --> 03:25.220
So just fly

03:27.430 --> 03:30.390
Fly high

03:30.390 --> 03:33.520
Into the distant future

03:37.020 --> 03:37.020
{Part A}

03:38.150 --> 03:38.860
Captains.

03:40.740 --> 03:42.660

03:41.280 --> 03:45.780
Episode Twenty: 
Sweep Clear

03:42.660 --> 03:44.660
I guess you're okay now.

03:44.660 --> 03:45.950
Yeah, thanks.

03:45.950 --> 03:47.950
I got to rest a while, so I'm actually full of energy.

03:47.950 --> 03:49.200
Oh, really?

03:50.790 --> 03:54.220
You seem like you've aged a bit, Sawamura.

03:54.940 --> 03:56.380
These past four months...

03:58.160 --> 04:00.130
Another penalty?

04:00.130 --> 04:01.840
You guys must love those.

04:01.840 --> 04:05.520
Hey, hey, hey! You on a break?

04:05.520 --> 04:08.140
Then let's practice!

04:08.140 --> 04:11.350
I've been whipped into shape by some other goons.

04:08.140 --> 04:12.230
Hey, hey, hey!

04:11.350 --> 04:13.100
Dunno what you're talking about, but good job.

04:13.520 --> 04:17.320
Tails is Aoba Jousai, heads is Karasuno.

04:22.380 --> 04:24.320
We'll receive first.

04:24.850 --> 04:26.780
Then we'll serve first.

04:26.780 --> 04:29.910
Karasuno                    Aoba Jousai

04:26.780 --> 04:29.910
Karasuno                    Aoba Jousai

04:28.610 --> 04:29.910
Line up!

04:49.220 --> 04:52.810
We're gonna win this match.

04:56.000 --> 04:56.810
Yeah.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.230
Let's have a good match!

05:04.130 --> 05:06.660
Hey! I made it in time.

05:07.030 --> 05:07.870
Hey.

05:07.870 --> 05:11.040
The Waku South match in the morning was pretty brutal.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.700
Really? I wish I'd been able to see it.

05:13.700 --> 05:14.370
Huh?

05:14.370 --> 05:17.830
Heya! I'm Tanaka Ryuunosuke's big sister!

05:17.830 --> 05:19.290
Hi!

05:19.290 --> 05:21.340
<i>She looks just like him.</i>

05:21.820 --> 05:24.220
They got all the way to the semis, huh?

05:24.220 --> 05:25.300
Yeah.

05:25.300 --> 05:26.930
This is the semi-finals?

05:26.930 --> 05:28.430
Huh? That means...

Wait. So if they win this one and the next one, 
they're going to nationals?! Isn't that awesome?!

05:32.960 --> 05:36.590
Well, only if they beat the next two powerful schools.

05:38.010 --> 05:41.730
This will be the third time our
 current team has faced Karasuno.

05:42.440 --> 05:46.490
They've surprised us every time.

05:46.490 --> 05:50.200
I'm sure things won't go smoothly this time, either.

05:50.200 --> 05:54.830
But if we keep our cool, victory will come naturally.

05:54.830 --> 05:56.870
Go play to the best of your abilities.

05:56.870 --> 05:58.080
Yessir!

05:58.080 --> 06:01.540
I hate to say it, but Karasuno's a formidable enemy.

06:01.960 --> 06:05.010
I'm surprised you're being so honest.

06:05.010 --> 06:07.880
I learned my lesson after last time.

06:07.880 --> 06:10.180
If we let our guard down, they'll devour us whole.

06:10.180 --> 06:12.350
Let's rip them up from the get-go.

06:12.350 --> 06:13.600
Yeah!

06:14.880 --> 06:18.350
All right, so, today...

06:20.100 --> 06:20.480
I trust...

06:20.480 --> 06:22.440
We trust you, Captain!

06:31.010 --> 06:31.910
You're gonna make me blu—

06:31.910 --> 06:34.160
We trust your serves.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.470
If you mess up, you owe us ramen.

06:36.470 --> 06:38.870
I want extra roasted pork slices.

06:38.870 --> 06:40.960
I'll add a side of potstickers to that.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.040
And lazy serves that only go over the net don't count.

06:43.870 --> 06:46.050
Come on, first- and second-years. You guys can request too.

06:46.050 --> 06:47.380
Seriously?!

06:50.520 --> 06:55.850
The crow's broken wing has healed,
 and now it's stronger than it's ever been.

06:56.860 --> 07:00.650
You've trained your bodies, techniques, and minds for this day.

07:00.650 --> 07:04.440
So please leave everything on the court, and take flight into the vast blue sky.

07:04.780 --> 07:08.150
As long as you do what needs to be done, the results will come your way.

07:08.150 --> 07:10.070
That's what I believe.

07:10.070 --> 07:11.530
Yes, sir!

07:11.530 --> 07:12.490
Ukai.

07:13.660 --> 07:18.540
To be honest, Seijou's a bad matchup for you guys.

07:19.690 --> 07:23.710
As is any team that's calm and collected.

07:24.920 --> 07:27.090
But surpassing them is our only option.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.350
So go win this time!

07:34.350 --> 07:37.340
Yeah!

07:55.130 --> 08:00.370
Go, go, go, go, go, Seijou!

07:57.740 --> 08:03.170
<b>Rule the Court</b>

07:57.740 --> 08:03.170
<b>Rule the Court</b>

08:00.370 --> 08:05.750
Push it, push it, push it, push it, push it, Seijou!

08:08.380 --> 08:10.460
Give us a good serve, Oikawa!

08:10.460 --> 08:13.800
Man, Oikawa's serving first?

08:14.090 --> 08:15.590
Is he that good?

08:15.590 --> 08:16.850
Is he?

08:16.850 --> 08:18.600
He's a frickin' cannon.

08:18.600 --> 08:22.230
If Seijou's able to build momentum with his serve, 
we're gonna be in trouble.

08:22.690 --> 08:25.340
And there's a very decent chance of that happening.

08:25.730 --> 08:27.190
Give us a good serve!

08:27.190 --> 08:28.210
Soy sauce!

08:28.210 --> 08:29.230
Pork bone!

08:29.230 --> 08:30.570
Dan dan noodles!

08:32.140 --> 08:35.160
I can't tell if you want me to land this spike or not!

08:37.590 --> 08:39.620
Sadly, there's no doubt...

08:46.070 --> 08:47.880
that you're going to land it.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.970
Whoa! They were able to dig out the first serve!

08:55.930 --> 08:57.140
All right!

08:57.980 --> 08:59.810
I think just touching that would rip my arms off!

08:59.810 --> 09:00.390
Wait!

09:00.860 --> 09:02.120
It's going back over the net!

09:02.120 --> 09:03.100
They're gonna hit it down!

09:06.690 --> 09:08.020
Nice one, Kageyama!

09:07.400 --> 09:10.610
<i>Kageyama touched the ball first, so they can't do a fast attack!</i>

09:10.610 --> 09:12.110
<i>Their attack will be a simple...</i>

09:28.210 --> 09:30.670
All right!

09:29.250 --> 09:30.170
Nice spike.

09:32.110 --> 09:34.630
How are those two the most surprised by it?!

09:34.630 --> 09:38.340
Karasuno                    Aoba Jousai

09:34.630 --> 09:38.340
Karasuno                    Aoba Jousai

09:34.920 --> 09:36.610
Nice one, Asahi, Nishinoya!

09:36.610 --> 09:37.380
Yeah!

09:37.380 --> 09:38.340
Thanks!

09:38.760 --> 09:40.300
All right, let's go,

09:41.100 --> 09:42.770
reborn Karasuno!

09:48.690 --> 09:50.590
Give us a good serve, Kageyama!

09:50.590 --> 09:51.770
Let's get another point!

09:58.990 --> 10:00.240
Makki!

10:00.240 --> 10:01.950
<i>That's a really good location!</i>

10:05.870 --> 10:07.120
Shake it off!

10:08.110 --> 10:09.830
So close! You'll get the next one!

10:09.830 --> 10:11.750
Karasuno                    Aoba Jousai

10:09.830 --> 10:11.750
Karasuno                    Aoba Jousai

10:12.110 --> 10:14.050
Give us a good one, Iwaizumi!

10:15.590 --> 10:18.130
<i>I'm pretty sure his serves are intense too.</i>

10:18.130 --> 10:19.550
Bring it!

10:25.060 --> 10:26.430
<i>Damn, it went long!</i>

10:26.430 --> 10:27.770
Sorry, Kageyama!

10:27.770 --> 10:30.560
Man, there's one insane serve after another.

10:30.560 --> 10:31.730
What's with those guys?

10:32.940 --> 10:34.360
Hit it, Kunimi!

10:39.430 --> 10:40.660
Nice spike, Tanaka!

10:41.370 --> 10:42.910
Thanks!

10:42.910 --> 10:44.830
I'm surprised he got it in!

10:44.830 --> 10:49.080
Well done, Ryuu! Love ya!

10:49.080 --> 10:51.790
Stop that, Big Sis!

10:53.350 --> 10:55.500
I wanna touch the ball too!

10:57.110 --> 10:58.470
All right!

10:58.760 --> 11:01.450
This Seijou versus Karasuno match is awesome.

11:01.450 --> 11:03.430
Oh, really?

11:03.430 --> 11:04.890
Nice receive!

11:04.890 --> 11:06.390
Get another one!

11:08.890 --> 11:10.370
Nice, Mattsun.

11:10.370 --> 11:11.730
Left!

11:15.910 --> 11:17.480
All right!

11:19.040 --> 11:19.780
My bad!

11:19.780 --> 11:21.740
Sorry! It was a little low!

11:21.740 --> 11:23.910
Karasuno                    Aoba Jousai

11:21.740 --> 11:23.910
Karasuno                    Aoba Jousai

11:23.910 --> 11:25.240
Give us a good serve, Tsukishima!

11:24.600 --> 11:25.990
Go!

11:26.290 --> 11:30.100
Wow, they're starting off neck-and-neck.

11:30.100 --> 11:31.960
Yeah, but...

11:32.720 --> 11:36.320
I'd love to see Hinata land a fast attack right about now.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.460
Yeah.

11:37.460 --> 11:38.270
Why?

11:38.930 --> 11:40.420
At the end of their last match with Seijou,

11:41.270 --> 11:46.140
Hinata's fast attack had the perfect timing, but it still got completely shut down.

11:47.980 --> 11:50.850
It even left an impression on us.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.650
Give us another good serve!

11:51.200 --> 11:54.940
For Hinata and Kageyama, it might not
 be a memory they can just sweep away.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.070
Iwa!

12:04.120 --> 12:05.410
Nice, Daichi!

12:05.950 --> 12:06.910
<i>Here it comes!</i>

12:17.200 --> 12:19.380
Yes! He was perfectly positioned!

12:19.700 --> 12:21.590
It's coming back over! Move back! Back!

12:21.910 --> 12:23.080
Cover it!

12:23.080 --> 12:26.300
<i>He's so worked up that he didn't see the block!</i>

12:27.550 --> 12:29.140
Damn it. I'll get the next one!

12:27.550 --> 12:29.140
Nice one, Oikawa!

12:31.850 --> 12:35.480
Calm don't... up... down, moron!

12:35.480 --> 12:36.730
<i>What was that?</i>

12:36.730 --> 12:38.570
<i>That goes for you too, Kageyama.</i>

12:38.570 --> 12:40.990
We're counting on you, Iwaizumi!

12:40.990 --> 12:44.240
<i>Damn it. He kicked me for real!</i>

12:41.440 --> 12:42.490
Yeah!

12:46.030 --> 12:47.070
Nice contact!

12:47.070 --> 12:48.450
Keep it going!

12:48.450 --> 12:49.700
Got it!

12:54.830 --> 12:56.330
<i>One more time!</i>

12:56.330 --> 12:58.290
<i>Go!</i>

12:59.790 --> 13:01.800
<i>Use our despair...</i>

13:15.360 --> 13:16.770
<i>to smash through!</i>

13:30.580 --> 13:31.580
We're finally...

13:34.790 --> 13:36.170
at the start line!

Karasuno's really good this year.

13:59.230 --> 14:00.730
All right!

14:00.730 --> 14:02.190
Nice spike, Hinata!

14:02.480 --> 14:04.070
That's it, Hinata!

14:04.070 --> 14:04.900
We're finally...

14:05.360 --> 14:06.700
at the start line!

14:07.440 --> 14:09.700
You kicked me for real, you jerk!

14:09.700 --> 14:11.530
I woke you up, moron!

14:11.530 --> 14:12.940
What'd you say?!

14:12.940 --> 14:13.870
Now, now...

14:14.620 --> 14:16.330
Damn. They've picked themselves back up.

14:16.330 --> 14:19.300
But that's only thanks to my advice!

14:19.300 --> 14:22.340
Those two getting more confident is hardly a good thing.

14:22.340 --> 14:23.800
I know.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.720
Let's take our time and form a strategy.

14:26.720 --> 14:27.760
Yeah!

14:27.760 --> 14:31.760
Karasuno                    Aoba Jousai

14:27.760 --> 14:31.760
Karasuno                    Aoba Jousai

14:28.930 --> 14:32.890
This is only the first set, 
but that's an impressive score against Seijou.

14:32.890 --> 14:33.890
Yeah.

14:33.890 --> 14:37.120
I didn't think Karasuno would make it this far.

14:37.120 --> 14:39.550
I guess their performance last time wasn't just a fluke.

14:39.550 --> 14:41.190
All right!

14:45.730 --> 14:47.950
Nice receive, Daichi!

14:49.780 --> 14:53.400
<i>Are they not going to try to block Hinata's broad jump again?</i>

15:01.820 --> 15:03.540
All right!

15:03.540 --> 15:05.050
Nice, Hinata!

15:03.540 --> 15:07.090
<i>It looks like where number ten 
hit it last time wasn't an accident.</i>

15:07.090 --> 15:08.820
Shake it off!

15:10.090 --> 15:12.110
Give us a good serve, Kageyama!

15:14.240 --> 15:15.760
Sorry! Someone get under it!

15:15.760 --> 15:17.350
We're counting on you, Makki!

15:17.350 --> 15:18.350
Got it!

15:18.350 --> 15:19.100
Kunimi!

15:19.100 --> 15:19.690
Right!

15:24.570 --> 15:26.110
Nice spike!

15:26.110 --> 15:27.860
Nice set.

15:27.860 --> 15:30.530
<i>They did that like it was nothing.</i>

15:30.530 --> 15:31.820
<i>They're so damn good.</i>

15:31.820 --> 15:35.910
Aoba Jousai always plays so skillfully.

15:35.910 --> 15:38.450
How well their gears mesh together is truly impressive.

15:36.330 --> 15:37.830
Give us a good one, Iwaizumi!

15:38.450 --> 15:40.290
Yeah, it really pisses me off!

15:43.160 --> 15:43.960
Sorry!

15:43.160 --> 15:44.460
All right!

15:46.670 --> 15:51.130
Karasuno                       Aoba Jousai

15:46.670 --> 15:51.130
Karasuno                       Aoba Jousai

15:48.260 --> 15:49.510
Yeah!

15:49.510 --> 15:51.130
Nice spike, Makki!

15:51.130 --> 15:52.470
We're counting on you.

15:52.470 --> 15:53.950
Hey.

15:54.850 --> 15:57.100
Bring it!

15:57.100 --> 15:59.850
<i>The guys who don't do jump serves aim for...</i>

16:03.060 --> 16:04.270
Got it!

16:04.270 --> 16:07.020
<i>It's time for the back row setter to make his appearance!</i>

16:07.400 --> 16:08.730
Nice receive!

16:08.730 --> 16:10.540
Yes! Nice and clean!

16:10.540 --> 16:12.700
Go for another broad jump, Hinata!

16:17.980 --> 16:19.370
<i>He's going in for the block?</i>

16:20.040 --> 16:22.830
<i>It'll be hard to stop it by myself...</i>

16:25.930 --> 16:27.960
<i>Please don't hit it over here, okay?</i>

16:27.960 --> 16:29.460
<i>You can't hit it this way, right?</i>

16:32.060 --> 16:32.420
<i>Here it is!</i>

16:33.010 --> 16:34.640
<i>A straight spike right at me!</i>

16:35.180 --> 16:38.930
You ignore the cross-court spike and wait for a straight spike.

16:38.930 --> 16:40.890
Nice receive, Kindaichi!

16:39.300 --> 16:40.890
<i>They forced him to the side!</i>

16:41.480 --> 16:42.560
Counterattack!

16:45.190 --> 16:46.860
All right!

16:46.860 --> 16:48.940
<i>He put me under so much pressure.</i>

16:48.940 --> 16:50.660
<i>Those third-years are scary!</i>

16:48.940 --> 16:50.660
Nice receive, Kindaichi!

16:50.660 --> 16:51.740
Thanks!

16:51.740 --> 16:54.360
Looks like if we cut off his options, then we can dig out the spike.

16:54.360 --> 16:56.090
I'll give it a shot next time.

16:56.090 --> 16:57.910
You're pretty scary right now, Mattsun.

16:58.220 --> 17:00.540
Shake it off, Shouyou! You almost had it!

16:58.590 --> 17:02.870
<i>They've already thought up a way to counter Hinata's broad jump.</i>

17:00.540 --> 17:01.370
Right!

17:03.400 --> 17:05.290
Nothing less from Seijou.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.250
Indeed.

17:06.250 --> 17:09.710
They're always thinking as they play.

17:09.710 --> 17:12.590
That's probably why they're so good.

17:12.590 --> 17:14.550
Karasuno                    Aoba Jousai

17:12.590 --> 17:14.550
Karasuno                    Aoba Jousai

17:13.340 --> 17:14.050
But...

17:16.060 --> 17:17.470
Nice receive!

17:18.220 --> 17:25.140
<i>Sugawara told me that with Seijou's fast attacks, 
I should wait a little while...</i>

17:25.850 --> 17:26.650
<i>and then jump!</i>

17:30.320 --> 17:31.530
All right!

17:32.310 --> 17:34.320
<i>How's payback taste?</i>

17:34.320 --> 17:36.740
<i>Don't get so cocky after just one point!</i>

17:37.030 --> 17:38.240
Good!

17:39.000 --> 17:41.450
He learned from last time!

17:41.940 --> 17:44.710
Karasuno's able to handle us a lot better this go-round.

17:44.710 --> 17:47.170
We can't seem to pull ahead.

17:49.220 --> 17:50.130
Nice receive!

17:53.800 --> 17:57.260
Karasuno                    Aoba Jousai

17:53.800 --> 17:57.260
Karasuno                    Aoba Jousai

17:54.300 --> 17:57.260
Great, great, Yuutarou! Push it, push it, Yuutarou!

17:57.260 --> 17:59.470
Do it again!

17:57.260 --> 18:00.220
<b>Rule the Court</b>

17:57.260 --> 18:00.220
<b>Rule the Court</b>

18:00.220 --> 18:03.140
Here he comes again.

18:04.270 --> 18:06.180
It's the guy whose serve could rip your arm off.

18:06.180 --> 18:08.060
Give us a good serve, Oikawa!

18:17.470 --> 18:19.600
Just in case, watch the back of your head.

18:19.600 --> 18:20.240
What?

18:24.140 --> 18:26.000
Bring it!

18:43.880 --> 18:45.770
Sorry!

18:45.770 --> 18:48.320
Damn it!

18:46.270 --> 18:48.720
So close! I like the aggressiveness, though!

18:48.720 --> 18:49.980
Let's get the next one!

18:50.810 --> 18:51.980
That was lucky!

18:51.980 --> 18:53.070
Let's get another point!

18:53.700 --> 18:56.030
<i>Huh?! What the hell was that?!</i>

18:56.030 --> 18:58.050
<i>He can hit the ball even harder?!</i>

18:58.050 --> 18:59.950
<i>That was basically a spike!</i>

19:00.610 --> 19:03.410
That felt pretty good against my hand.

19:01.330 --> 19:03.410
<i>Maybe that serve was a fluke.</i>

19:03.410 --> 19:04.660
Get over it!

19:03.410 --> 19:05.540
<i>No, it wasn't a fluke.</i>

19:04.660 --> 19:05.540
Got it!

19:05.540 --> 19:06.700
<i>At least, I don't think it was.</i>

19:07.380 --> 19:10.370
<i>Did he hit it that hard knowing it was risky?</i>

19:11.750 --> 19:13.940
That was an insane serve!

19:13.940 --> 19:15.500
I wanna try to receive it!

19:17.050 --> 19:18.550
What a sound...

19:18.550 --> 19:21.300
I can't... Someone's arms are gonna fly off...

19:21.300 --> 19:23.850
Honestly, I don't think I could get that myself.

19:24.510 --> 19:27.770
Feels like it hit the ground before I even noticed.

19:27.770 --> 19:28.980
But...

19:28.980 --> 19:30.940
Karasuno                    Aoba Jousai

19:28.980 --> 19:30.940
Karasuno                    Aoba Jousai

19:30.000 --> 19:30.940
All right!

19:31.250 --> 19:32.900
We're at set point!

19:32.900 --> 19:34.110
Just one more!

19:34.110 --> 19:35.900
Go for it!

19:38.110 --> 19:38.940
Thanks.

19:45.730 --> 19:48.620
<i>It won't be easy to surpass that serve.</i>

19:48.620 --> 19:50.270
<i>I shouldn't try too hard to compete.</i>

19:50.940 --> 19:54.110
<i>The team does better when we all play well.</i>

19:55.210 --> 19:58.740
Whoa, is Karasuno really going to take the first set?

19:58.740 --> 20:02.930
Seijou better think of something fast,
 or they might be in trouble.

20:03.290 --> 20:04.680
We're gonna take this set!

20:04.680 --> 20:05.930
Keep it up!

20:05.930 --> 20:07.010
Right!

20:09.390 --> 20:11.190
This is no time to panic.

20:11.190 --> 20:13.170
They need to go out there and fight.

20:20.900 --> 20:22.740
Nice spike, Iwaizumi!

20:20.900 --> 20:23.860
Karasuno                       Aoba Jousai

20:20.900 --> 20:23.860
Karasuno                       Aoba Jousai

20:23.860 --> 20:26.830
If Seijou scores one more point, it'll be a deuce.

20:26.830 --> 20:28.830
They'll lose if they don't.

20:29.320 --> 20:30.750
Stay calm! Just one point to go!

20:30.750 --> 20:32.950
We're gonna score here!

20:32.950 --> 20:34.420
Right!

20:34.420 --> 20:37.790
<i>Just one more point,
 and we can take the first set off of Seijou!</i>

20:37.790 --> 20:40.010
Focus on this point!

20:41.310 --> 20:43.820
Trying to get that last point can be rough.

20:43.820 --> 20:47.220
True, but Seijou's got it even harder.

20:50.330 --> 20:52.640
Seijou's swapping players?

20:54.700 --> 20:56.560
This is where it happens?

21:01.230 --> 21:02.650
It's that guy from earlier.

21:02.650 --> 21:03.490
Yeah.

21:03.490 --> 21:05.570
I've never seen that player before.

21:05.570 --> 21:06.950
Yes.

21:07.340 --> 21:09.080
He's not a pinch server or anything,

21:09.080 --> 21:13.910
and yet they're putting him in for the first time when their opponent is at set point?

21:14.400 --> 21:16.960
They might be strengthening their blocking on the left side.

21:16.960 --> 21:19.270
Make sure your spikes don't get blocked.

21:19.270 --> 21:20.130
Yessir.

21:23.590 --> 21:25.600
Give us a good serve, Iwaizumi!

21:29.720 --> 21:30.850
Sorry, it's short!

21:31.230 --> 21:32.220
Tanaka!

21:33.410 --> 21:34.180
I touched it!

21:34.180 --> 21:35.190
Let's score here!

21:36.560 --> 21:37.730
Got it!

21:39.170 --> 21:40.260
<i>Kindaichi...</i>

22:01.620 --> 22:06.740
<i>A wrench was intentionally thrown into the gears that were working together flawlessly.</i>

22:07.370 --> 22:11.450
<i>Then, suddenly, they became something completely mysterious and unknown.</i>

22:14.980 --> 22:14.980
{ED}

22:27.200 --> 22:31.330
When I was just a nobody, something lit up my eyes

22:31.330 --> 22:37.130
I was merely a guy languishing complacently in the dark, happy with what I had

22:31.330 --> 22:37.130
I was merely a guy languishing complacently in the dark, happy with what I had

22:37.130 --> 22:41.550
Now I'm torn toward the heavens even on a starless night

22:41.550 --> 22:46.600
Whether our time comes to us or not is a matter for those in another world

22:46.630 --> 22:56.810
That's right, our lungs pumping and our hearts beating is all we have in this new realm

22:46.630 --> 22:56.810
That's right, our lungs pumping and our hearts beating is all we have in this new realm

22:56.810 --> 23:01.940
We've always been dancing on an unlit stage, but now beyond that

23:01.940 --> 23:08.740
We're awaiting the rising of a sun that none have yet witnessed

23:08.740 --> 23:14.660
Now that we're deliberating at a crossroads, paths blurring together

23:08.740 --> 23:14.660
Now that we're deliberating at a crossroads, paths blurring together

23:15.210 --> 23:17.290
We can feel it

23:15.210 --> 23:17.290
We can feel it

23:17.290 --> 23:22.420
Inside this uncharted world which has yet to take on a name

23:22.420 --> 23:28.680
As I'm waiting for the dawn to reach my eyes with a familiar light

23:28.680 --> 23:35.600
I'm reminded of days I won't return to, and seeking proof of newfound existence

23:35.600 --> 23:38.440
We brace ourselves

23:44.940 --> 23:44.940
{Preview}

23:45.520 --> 23:48.940
<i>Number sixteen's spike was all "whoosh" and "boom"!</i>

23:48.940 --> 23:54.310
<i>I have to wonder why he's playing volleyball, considering how evil his eyes look and how provocative he is.</i>

23:54.310 --> 23:56.530
<i>All of that applies to you too, you know.</i>
