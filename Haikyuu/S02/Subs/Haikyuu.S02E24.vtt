Karasuno              Aoba Jousai

00:00.980 --> 00:03.440
Karasuno              Aoba Jousai

00:03.440 --> 00:04.610
Up front!

00:03.440 --> 00:05.070
Slam it down!

00:10.280 --> 00:12.410
All right!

00:12.410 --> 00:14.620
Yes! Back-to-back points!

00:14.620 --> 00:17.120
Yes! Yes! They flipped it back around!

00:17.120 --> 00:18.370
That was amazing!

00:18.370 --> 00:20.830
Did it land in front of the attack line?

00:21.210 --> 00:25.260
Because he hit it by snapping his wrist, the spike wasn't as powerful.

00:25.260 --> 00:28.800
But as long as it gets past the block, 
they can't dig the ball up from that angle.

00:29.340 --> 00:33.430
Did Kageyama mean to give that to Hinata?

00:29.340 --> 00:31.140
Push through!

00:31.140 --> 00:32.930
Nice spike, Hinata!

00:33.430 --> 00:36.140
Or did he make a mistake?

00:36.140 --> 00:37.020
Shut up.

00:37.020 --> 00:39.980
Hey, that was awesome! You basically hit it straight down!

00:40.350 --> 00:41.730
Was that intentional?!

00:42.360 --> 00:46.030
Hinata was close to the net, so I made the set close too.

00:46.030 --> 00:47.690
I'm glad it worked out.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.410
The ingenious part about Tobio

00:51.990 --> 00:55.120
isn't his technique, it's his stupidity.

00:55.700 --> 00:59.160
Where others would probably hold back,
 he goes straight for it.

00:56.040 --> 00:58.410
All right! Let's go do it again!

00:58.410 --> 00:59.790
Right!

01:00.420 --> 01:03.330
For better or worse.

01:06.380 --> 01:08.420
When he's concentrating, he can't see his surroundings

01:09.130 --> 01:11.840
and doesn't even realize that 
no one's keeping up with him.

01:14.430 --> 01:15.260
But...

01:16.140 --> 01:18.020
Give us another good serve, Tsukishima!

01:16.140 --> 01:19.270
an idiot that goes even further ahead than him has appeared.

01:18.020 --> 01:19.770
You're putting too much strength into that!

01:19.770 --> 01:22.730
I just jumped up where there weren't any blockers!

01:23.400 --> 01:25.320
So this is where number ten comes into play.

01:25.320 --> 01:26.610
Yeah.

01:26.610 --> 01:29.440
Those two never cease to surprise me.

01:30.860 --> 01:31.700
However...

01:33.450 --> 01:36.700
in volleyball, the team that's better as six wins.

01:36.700 --> 01:37.660
Come on, bring it!

01:37.660 --> 01:38.950
Let's get this one!

01:38.950 --> 01:39.660
Yeah!

01:41.500 --> 01:43.420
If you understand that, then good.

01:49.880 --> 01:51.880
We're<i> going to win!</i>

01:53.970 --> 01:53.970
{OP}

01:54.390 --> 01:57.390
Leap and fly! High!

01:57.390 --> 02:00.430
Flecked with blood, sweat, and tears

02:00.430 --> 02:04.650
Those glistening wings can let you leave it all behind

02:04.650 --> 02:07.820
So just fly

02:31.210 --> 02:35.340
They just want to see the ends of the ocean

02:35.760 --> 02:40.350
Empty your mind

02:40.350 --> 02:45.940
Let the headwinds guide your approach

02:45.940 --> 02:48.060
And with a hop, step, and a jump

02:48.940 --> 02:52.070
Leap and fly! High!

02:52.070 --> 02:56.740
Let your wings, glistening with blood, sweat, and tears

02:56.740 --> 02:59.370
Take you to wherever you need to go

02:59.370 --> 03:02.160
Unleash your unrefined impulses

03:02.160 --> 03:05.160
Uncover your instincts and bare your uncut fangs

03:05.160 --> 03:07.040
It may take an arduous path

03:07.040 --> 03:09.250
But be torn down it endlessly to achieve your dream

03:09.250 --> 03:12.260
So just fly

03:14.470 --> 03:17.430
Fly high

03:17.430 --> 03:20.560

Episode Twenty-four: 
The Absolute Limit Switch

03:26.730 --> 03:28.560
Give us a good serve, Tsukishima!

03:29.440 --> 03:30.520
Got it!

03:31.150 --> 03:32.400
Nice receive!

03:31.570 --> 03:34.490
<i>That last attack was just luck.</i>

03:32.400 --> 03:33.440
Left!

03:34.490 --> 03:36.030
<i>Before it matures...</i>

03:36.610 --> 03:37.780
<i>I'll crush them!</i>

03:40.830 --> 03:42.540
All right!

03:42.540 --> 03:44.120
All right! We're tied!

03:44.120 --> 03:45.500
Go for it!

03:48.000 --> 03:49.710
All right!

03:49.710 --> 03:51.920
Nice spike, Tanaka!

03:50.250 --> 03:51.920
Ryuu!

03:54.590 --> 03:56.420
Yeah!

03:56.420 --> 03:58.380
Good luck, Matsukawa!

04:01.680 --> 04:02.810
We're counting on you!

04:02.810 --> 04:03.560
Yeah!

04:03.890 --> 04:05.600
A pinch server, huh?

04:03.890 --> 04:06.100
I'm counting on you here, Yahaba.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.770
They're probably strengthening their defense too.

04:06.100 --> 04:06.890
Right!

04:08.560 --> 04:10.230
Give us a good serve, Yahaba!

04:11.020 --> 04:12.480
<i>With everything I have...</i>

04:13.270 --> 04:14.440
Asahi!

04:14.440 --> 04:15.400
Sorry!

04:15.400 --> 04:16.320
Cover it!

04:16.320 --> 04:17.150
Tanaka!

04:17.150 --> 04:18.490
Two blockers!

04:19.820 --> 04:20.660
Yahaba!

04:20.660 --> 04:21.240
Right!

04:21.240 --> 04:22.280
Kyoutani!

04:22.280 --> 04:23.240
<i>Crap! It's short!</i>

04:26.330 --> 04:27.960
All right!

04:27.960 --> 04:29.960
Did he just hit with his left hand?

04:29.960 --> 04:32.000
He's right-handed, right?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.670
Did he just do that on the spot?

04:34.750 --> 04:37.630
He has total control of his body.

04:42.300 --> 04:44.390
Karasuno              Aoba Jousai

04:42.300 --> 04:44.390
Karasuno              Aoba Jousai

04:43.300 --> 04:45.060
That's two points in a row.

04:45.060 --> 04:48.350
If they reach 20 points first, it's going to be rough.

04:48.350 --> 04:50.600
Don't let them pull away!

04:52.520 --> 04:53.900
Yeah!

04:53.900 --> 04:54.860
Nice receive!

05:08.540 --> 05:10.330
All right!

05:10.920 --> 05:12.960
You little brat.

05:16.670 --> 05:17.670
Kyoutani...

05:18.920 --> 05:20.300
We're counting on you!

05:20.800 --> 05:22.090
Yeah!

05:25.260 --> 05:27.390
Yes! We've caught up.

05:27.390 --> 05:29.730
Yeah, they're really focusing hard.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.850
Give us a good serve, Tanaka!

05:30.640 --> 05:33.150
Those guys never cease to surprise me.

05:36.190 --> 05:37.360
Got it!

05:38.150 --> 05:39.690
Watch the right! The right!

05:38.570 --> 05:39.690
Number sixteen!

05:39.690 --> 05:40.610
Stop them!

05:41.240 --> 05:42.610
Nice contact!

05:41.860 --> 05:43.570
Yes! Keep it going!

05:43.570 --> 05:45.320
The receive is off! Watch the left side!

05:45.320 --> 05:46.280
Get back!

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Nice receive!

05:50.000 --> 05:51.210
Wow...

05:50.330 --> 05:51.210
One more!

05:54.790 --> 05:55.920
Someone cover it!

05:55.920 --> 05:56.670
Left!

06:04.930 --> 06:05.850
Damn it!

06:05.850 --> 06:07.810
All right!

06:07.810 --> 06:10.140
<i>Now we're in the 20s!</i>

06:08.720 --> 06:11.430
Karasuno            Aoba Jousai

06:08.720 --> 06:11.430
Karasuno            Aoba Jousai

06:11.430 --> 06:13.390
They got to 20 first.

06:17.230 --> 06:18.820
We don't have to panic.

06:19.110 --> 06:20.320
It's still just a one point lead.

06:36.790 --> 06:38.500
All right!

06:39.500 --> 06:40.800
We're counting on you!

06:48.220 --> 06:49.350
It's him again!

06:49.350 --> 06:52.810
The pinch server who got five points in a row during the second set!

06:57.770 --> 06:59.690
We're counting on you, Yamaguchi!

06:59.690 --> 07:00.980
Stay calm!

07:00.980 --> 07:02.610
Give it your all!

07:02.610 --> 07:03.440
Right!

07:03.440 --> 07:04.740
Go!

07:03.440 --> 07:04.740
Tadashi!

07:04.740 --> 07:06.160
Give us a good serve!

07:04.740 --> 07:06.160
Yamaguchi!

07:06.160 --> 07:08.240
Do that thing again!

07:10.030 --> 07:10.990
Yamaguchi.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.330
Go hit a good serve.

07:17.880 --> 07:18.790
Yeah.

07:18.790 --> 07:20.750
Karasuno              Aoba Jousai

07:18.790 --> 07:20.750
Karasuno              Aoba Jousai

07:22.210 --> 07:23.970
You can do this!

07:31.220 --> 07:32.060
<i>It's going out.</i>

07:34.730 --> 07:35.390
<i>No...</i>

07:39.810 --> 07:41.770
<i>This time it went long?!</i>

07:41.770 --> 07:43.230
Yay!

07:41.770 --> 07:43.230
Yeah!

07:45.650 --> 07:47.070
What?!

07:47.070 --> 07:48.860
Whoa! He actually kept it in play!

07:48.860 --> 07:50.410
The last hit's all yours, Watari!

07:50.410 --> 07:51.280
Right.

07:51.950 --> 07:53.410
Here's our chance!

07:55.290 --> 07:57.160
<i>A synchronized attack!</i>

08:01.880 --> 08:03.840
Yeah!

08:03.840 --> 08:06.720
Damn, his switch is totally flipped on.

08:04.170 --> 08:05.840
Nice receive, Iwa.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.300
Nice one, Iwaizumi!

08:08.680 --> 08:09.890
Wow...

08:11.600 --> 08:12.470
Makki!

08:14.640 --> 08:16.270
A tip!

08:16.270 --> 08:17.560
Damn it!

08:17.940 --> 08:21.020
<i>Yes! We managed to limit number twelve to one serve!</i>

08:18.390 --> 08:19.900
All right!

08:21.020 --> 08:22.270
Nice tip!

08:22.270 --> 08:22.940
Yeah!

08:24.440 --> 08:30.740
<i>When I was a kid, all I did was spike because it was fun, but now I can truly say this.</i>

08:31.570 --> 08:35.950
<i>I'm glad I learned how good it feels to dig out the perfect spike.</i>

08:39.540 --> 08:40.920
Shake it off, Yamaguchi!

08:42.290 --> 08:49.130
<i>Is that seriously the same guy from the interhigh prelims?</i>

08:42.920 --> 08:44.630
Give us a good one, Hanamaki!

08:49.130 --> 08:50.720
You didn't do anything wrong.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.260
The other team was just too good.

08:52.260 --> 08:53.600
Shake it off.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.260
Nice receive, Tanaka!

08:53.600 --> 08:54.350
Yes, sir.

08:56.140 --> 08:57.140
Yamaguchi!

08:58.390 --> 09:00.060
That was a great serve.

09:07.230 --> 09:10.200
Each and every point carries so much weight.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.110
Yeah.

09:11.950 --> 09:16.240
They're just gonna have to stay on top of the ball and keep stacking up points one at a time.

09:16.620 --> 09:18.250
That's the only way they can win.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.090
All right!

09:23.130 --> 09:25.090
Karasuno                  Aoba Jousai

09:23.130 --> 09:25.090
Karasuno                  Aoba Jousai

09:25.710 --> 09:27.880
Neither side is backing down.

09:27.880 --> 09:30.720
If this turns into a deuce again, 
will they keep going until they get a two-point—

09:30.720 --> 09:31.800
No.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.930
They're not gonna have time to think about that.

09:41.980 --> 09:43.900
Bring it!

09:56.280 --> 09:57.410
Seriously?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.710
All right!

10:03.000 --> 10:04.750
Nice serve!

10:03.370 --> 10:04.750
What was that?

10:05.580 --> 10:07.920
He can hit such an amazing serve in this tense situation?

10:07.920 --> 10:09.880
Is he some kind of monster?

10:11.550 --> 10:13.180
One more!

10:15.590 --> 10:16.930
All right!

10:15.590 --> 10:18.310
Karasuno                 Aoba Jousai

10:15.590 --> 10:18.310
Karasuno                 Aoba Jousai

10:16.930 --> 10:18.310
Seijou's at match point.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.020
It's that again.

10:22.310 --> 10:23.980
We're just gonna have to dig it out.

10:23.980 --> 10:24.980
Yeah!

10:25.480 --> 10:26.520
Switch gears!

10:26.020 --> 10:28.190
<i>Their mental strength is amazing.</i>

10:26.520 --> 10:27.310
Right!

10:28.190 --> 10:31.690
Karasuno                   Aoba Jousai

10:28.190 --> 10:31.690
Karasuno                   Aoba Jousai

10:28.610 --> 10:30.900
<i>They must be under an immense amount of pressure right now.</i>

10:32.530 --> 10:34.240
If we can get a hand on it, we'll make it work somehow!

10:34.570 --> 10:36.490
We're not gonna lose!

10:36.490 --> 10:37.410
Yeah!

10:40.620 --> 10:42.370
Give it your all!

10:43.370 --> 10:44.580
But of course.

10:46.250 --> 10:48.590
Well, it's time.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.670
You have to dig out his serve, no matter what!

10:58.600 --> 11:01.770
Olé!

11:14.570 --> 11:16.240
Yes!

11:26.750 --> 11:28.960
All right!

11:28.960 --> 11:30.460
All right!

11:29.340 --> 11:31.300
They stopped Oikawa!

11:31.300 --> 11:34.590
It's still match point for Seijou, though.

11:32.670 --> 11:41.640
Karasuno                  Aoba Jousai

11:32.670 --> 11:41.640
Karasuno                  Aoba Jousai

11:34.590 --> 11:37.090
The wall in front of this next point is high.

11:37.090 --> 11:41.640
Whoa. It's all over for Karasuno if they don't score here,

11:42.060 --> 11:44.100
yet they're switching out their libero?

11:45.060 --> 11:46.310
Sir.

11:46.310 --> 11:47.060
Right.

11:47.850 --> 11:48.980
Yeah!

11:51.320 --> 11:53.030
This is the final showdown.

11:56.240 --> 12:03.040
<b>!!</b>

11:56.240 --> 12:03.040
<b>!!</b>

11:56.240 --> 12:03.040

12:10.460 --> 12:11.540
Yeah!

12:14.210 --> 12:15.920
This is the final showdown.

12:18.340 --> 12:22.510
Oh, they're gonna do the tactical single point by two setters!

12:19.640 --> 12:20.930
Yeah!

12:22.260 --> 12:23.600
Yeah!

12:22.510 --> 12:24.810
If they can't score two in a row, they're done.

12:24.810 --> 12:25.810
Yeah!

12:25.810 --> 12:26.560
Please!

12:26.560 --> 12:27.810
Yeah!

12:27.230 --> 12:31.230
Do what you did back in the second set!

12:29.440 --> 12:30.560
Yeah!

12:33.900 --> 12:35.940
Give us a good serve, Suga!

12:35.940 --> 12:36.780
Yeah!

12:41.070 --> 12:44.910
<i>How is he always able to concentrate so intensely at the end of a match?</i>

12:45.790 --> 12:48.500
<i>Not that he has anything else going for him!</i>

12:48.500 --> 12:51.630
Huh? Why are you picking a fight with Hinata?

12:52.500 --> 12:54.090
Let's finish it right here!

12:54.090 --> 12:55.090
Yeah!

12:55.090 --> 12:56.090
Give us a good serve!

12:56.090 --> 12:57.510
Focus on one point at a time!

12:56.510 --> 12:59.470
<i>If I mess up this serve, it's all over.</i>

12:57.510 --> 12:58.420
Give us a good serve!

12:58.420 --> 12:59.470
Go!

12:59.470 --> 13:02.680
<i>And if we can't survive our opponent's attack, it's over.</i>

13:02.680 --> 13:03.800
Here I go!

13:07.730 --> 13:09.350
<i>Is it in or out?</i>

13:09.350 --> 13:11.440
<i>Is it going to be me or Iwaizumi?</i>

13:12.900 --> 13:14.610
<i>Damn, they got it!</i>

13:14.610 --> 13:16.820
<i>But the ace is out of the picture now!</i>

13:16.820 --> 13:18.570
Center!

13:40.840 --> 13:43.590
Yeah!

13:41.680 --> 13:43.590
You stopped it!

13:43.590 --> 13:45.470
Hinata!

13:43.590 --> 13:45.930
Shouyou!

13:46.600 --> 13:49.100
I mean, he <i>is</i> a middle blocker.

13:49.100 --> 13:51.270
He's supposed to be able to block.

13:53.650 --> 13:55.230
I feel bad, really!

13:55.230 --> 13:57.820
Great job taking that hit, Kageyama!

13:57.820 --> 14:01.030
Karasuno                  Aoba Jousai

13:57.820 --> 14:01.030
Karasuno                  Aoba Jousai

13:58.480 --> 13:59.820
Karasuno tied it up!

13:59.820 --> 14:01.030
It's a deuce!

14:01.360 --> 14:02.450
Sorry.

14:02.450 --> 14:03.030
Shake it off!

14:03.030 --> 14:04.240
Focus on the next one!

14:04.820 --> 14:10.160
<i>Rather than trying to block it, 
it was more like he jumped for the ball at all costs.</i>

14:10.450 --> 14:14.630
<i>I'm always astonished by Shorty's quick reaction time.</i>

14:15.630 --> 14:17.210
Do it again, Suga!

14:18.000 --> 14:19.130
Here I go.

14:21.050 --> 14:21.800
Up front!

14:22.090 --> 14:22.930
Damn it!

14:22.930 --> 14:25.930
Whoa, that was close! It barely went over!

14:25.930 --> 14:26.890
It broke their defenses!

14:26.890 --> 14:29.560
<i>Now he's trying to get Iwaizumi off balance?</i>

14:29.560 --> 14:34.060
<i>He may be Mr. Pleasant, 
but his serves aren't pleasant at all!</i>

14:30.470 --> 14:31.680
Center!

14:37.110 --> 14:38.730
In the front!

14:38.730 --> 14:40.440
<i>Hit the ground!</i>

14:41.030 --> 14:43.030
I got it!

14:43.490 --> 14:45.200
Yes!

14:45.660 --> 14:47.660
<i>Mr. Pleasant hit it first.</i>

14:48.450 --> 14:50.830
<i>Now they can't do that attack from before!</i>

14:52.040 --> 14:53.250
Go!

14:56.040 --> 14:58.210
<i>Even if you can't block it, at least make some contact!</i>

14:58.790 --> 15:01.050
Give it to me!

15:10.680 --> 15:14.060
You goddamn brats!

15:38.210 --> 15:38.580
Ka—

15:39.040 --> 15:41.040
Kageyama!

15:43.050 --> 15:44.670
I know.

15:43.880 --> 15:44.670
Nice, Kageyama!

15:45.340 --> 15:46.720
Well done!

15:47.890 --> 15:49.220
But...

15:50.430 --> 15:51.470
I won't lose.

15:54.060 --> 15:56.770
Karasuno              Aoba Jousai

15:54.060 --> 15:56.770
Karasuno              Aoba Jousai

15:54.810 --> 15:56.770
Just one more point!

15:56.770 --> 15:58.900
That was awesome, Tobio!

15:57.270 --> 16:05.360
Man, when Sugawara touched the ball first, 
I thought that meant Kageyama wouldn't be attacking.

16:05.360 --> 16:10.700
Yeah, but everyone's got the impression that when Sugawara's in the game, he's up to something,

16:10.700 --> 16:13.700
so their attention is drawn to him a little.

16:15.660 --> 16:17.790
Damn, that really pisses me off!

16:17.790 --> 16:20.380
That's definitely Oikawa's junior.

16:20.380 --> 16:25.880
He's got a setter's disposition, 
staying confident when it's all on the line.

16:25.880 --> 16:27.550
Yeah, he does.

16:28.430 --> 16:30.260
I'd love some of that confidence, to be honest.

16:36.850 --> 16:41.310
Have you found the limits of your abilities?

16:42.520 --> 16:47.610
Even though your technique, body, and mind haven't been perfected?

16:49.860 --> 16:56.370
People who are naturally better than you have been different from you since the day they were born.

16:57.700 --> 17:04.500
No matter how hard you work, how well you strategize, or who your teammates are, you can't change that.

17:05.840 --> 17:11.470
You can complain after you've actually done everything you possibly can.

17:13.180 --> 17:17.470
Rather than despairing and giving up because you're not a genius,

17:17.470 --> 17:23.980
believe that this isn't the limit of your strength 
and continue on the path straight ahead of you.

17:23.980 --> 17:27.570
It may be a harsh road, but...

17:31.240 --> 17:35.780
Today might be the day you seize
 the chance to let your talent bloom.

17:37.950 --> 17:42.460
It could be tomorrow, the day after, next year.

17:43.540 --> 17:46.000
Maybe even when you're 30.

17:46.920 --> 17:49.720
I'm not sure if physique has anything to do with it,

17:50.510 --> 17:53.930
but if you think it'll never come, it probably never will.

17:55.680 --> 17:59.430
Oikawa's seems different lately, doesn't he?

17:56.220 --> 18:01.060
Push it, push it, push it, push it, push it, Seijou!

18:00.180 --> 18:05.190
<b>Rule the Court</b>

18:00.180 --> 18:05.190
<b>Rule the Court</b>

18:01.060 --> 18:05.190
Go, go, go, go, go, go, Seijou!

18:05.190 --> 18:07.770
Go, go, Karasuno!

18:05.190 --> 18:07.770
Push it, push it, Karasuno!

18:07.770 --> 18:09.400
Hey, say it together!

18:09.400 --> 18:12.740
If they hit a serve way up in the front again, I'll get it.

18:12.740 --> 18:14.200
I'm leaving the rest to you.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.030
Right!

18:15.030 --> 18:16.330
Don't let your guard down.

18:16.330 --> 18:18.950
They might try to drop it on us again.

18:19.870 --> 18:21.830
Keep your eye on the ball.

18:21.830 --> 18:22.580
Right!

18:22.580 --> 18:24.460
Make sure to aim for the edges!

18:24.460 --> 18:25.920
I know.

18:25.920 --> 18:29.420
If I half-ass it, they'll instantly fire back at us.

18:29.420 --> 18:31.630
All we need to do is get a hand on it when blocking!

18:31.630 --> 18:32.550
Yeah!

18:34.510 --> 18:35.970
Let's get this point back!

18:35.970 --> 18:37.430
Let's score here!

18:38.010 --> 18:40.390
Yeah!

18:40.390 --> 18:43.100
Karasuno              Aoba Jousai

18:40.390 --> 18:43.100
Karasuno              Aoba Jousai

18:43.690 --> 18:45.310
Give us a good serve, Suga!

18:51.820 --> 18:52.280
Up front!

18:52.280 --> 18:53.400
Iwaizumi!

18:53.400 --> 18:55.320
<i>All right! He's off balance!</i>

18:59.080 --> 19:00.540
Damn it!

19:00.540 --> 19:02.160
Ryuu!

19:02.160 --> 19:02.790
Go!

19:03.080 --> 19:04.410
<i>Let's finish this!</i>

19:12.550 --> 19:14.680
Damn, he dug it out!

19:12.920 --> 19:15.510
Hanamaki!

19:14.680 --> 19:15.510
But...

19:16.760 --> 19:17.640
it's way off course!

19:17.640 --> 19:18.680
It's all up to you, Oikawa!

19:19.180 --> 19:20.390
Here's our chance!

19:33.490 --> 19:38.070
<i>A super-long and fast setup from outside the court...</i>

19:39.120 --> 19:40.530
<i>Number four's going for it!</i>

19:43.330 --> 19:45.710
<i>Talent is something you make bloom!</i>

19:46.330 --> 19:48.330
<i>Instinct is something you polish!</i>

19:51.460 --> 19:52.630
<i>It's perfect!</i>

19:57.050 --> 19:57.930
Damn it!

19:58.510 --> 19:59.970
Yeah!

20:05.730 --> 20:06.850
Get the last hit!

20:08.940 --> 20:11.270
<i>The team who's better as six wins!</i>

20:11.270 --> 20:13.480
Keep the rally going!

20:13.480 --> 20:15.690
This is our chance!

20:15.690 --> 20:17.900
<i>Like hell...</i>

20:17.900 --> 20:19.870
<i>He's gonna hit it from there?!</i>

20:19.870 --> 20:21.660
<i>...you'll get that chance!</i>

20:30.960 --> 20:32.170
Nice, Kyoutani!

20:33.170 --> 20:35.380
Hit it, Kageyama!

20:39.090 --> 20:41.010
<i>Shit. Talk about lame!</i>

20:43.930 --> 20:47.480
Give it to me!

20:48.520 --> 20:49.390
<i>Come.</i>

20:50.060 --> 20:52.560
<i>Come at me with your ultimate weapon,</i>

20:53.230 --> 20:54.070
<i>Tobio!</i>

21:01.910 --> 21:03.950
<i>They saw it coming!</i>

21:52.250 --> 21:53.000
All...

21:53.000 --> 21:59.840
...right!

21:59.840 --> 22:01.800
Karasuno                Aoba Jousai

22:16.020 --> 22:16.020
{ED}

22:28.290 --> 22:32.410
When I was just a nobody, something lit up my eyes

22:32.410 --> 22:38.210
I was merely a guy languishing complacently in the dark, happy with what I had

22:32.410 --> 22:38.210
I was merely a guy languishing complacently in the dark, happy with what I had

22:38.210 --> 22:42.630
Now I'm torn toward the heavens even on a starless night

22:42.630 --> 22:47.680
Whether our time comes to us or not is a matter for those in another world

22:47.720 --> 22:57.900
That's right, our lungs pumping and our hearts beating is all we have in this new realm

22:47.720 --> 22:57.900
That's right, our lungs pumping and our hearts beating is all we have in this new realm

22:57.900 --> 23:03.030
We've always been dancing on an unlit stage, but now beyond that

23:03.030 --> 23:09.830
We're awaiting the rising of a sun that none have yet witnessed

23:09.830 --> 23:15.750
Now that we're deliberating at a crossroads, paths blurring together

23:09.830 --> 23:15.750
Now that we're deliberating at a crossroads, paths blurring together

23:16.290 --> 23:18.380
We can feel it

23:16.290 --> 23:18.380
We can feel it

23:18.380 --> 23:23.510
Inside this uncharted world which has yet to take on a name

23:23.510 --> 23:29.760
As I'm waiting for the dawn to reach my eyes with a familiar light

23:29.760 --> 23:36.690
I'm reminded of days I won't return to, and seeking proof of newfound existence

23:36.690 --> 23:39.520
We brace ourselves

23:46.070 --> 23:46.070
{Preview}

23:46.780 --> 23:48.660
<i>We won! We won!</i>

23:49.160 --> 23:52.240
<i>Shimada... are you crying?</i>

23:52.240 --> 23:55.460
<i>N-No, my contact lens just slipped...</i>

23:55.460 --> 23:57.750
<i>But you're wearing glasses.</i>
