00:01.610 --> 00:07.280
Go, go, let's go! Let's go Date Tech!

00:01.610 --> 00:07.280
Attack! Attack, attack, attack, attack, Seijou!

00:07.740 --> 00:09.240
Well?! Are they winning?!

00:09.240 --> 00:10.780
Stop pushing!

00:10.780 --> 00:13.490

00:14.870 --> 00:16.910
At least the lead is only two points.

00:16.910 --> 00:18.540
They're in the second set.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.670
Who took the first set?

00:21.540 --> 00:22.460
Um...

00:23.250 --> 00:26.050
Apparently Seijou won the first set.

00:26.050 --> 00:27.380
Ah, Karasuno!

00:27.380 --> 00:30.470
H-Hey there...

00:30.470 --> 00:32.050
Hey.

00:32.050 --> 00:33.300
Heyo.

00:34.180 --> 00:35.100
Heyo.

00:35.100 --> 00:36.060
Hello!

00:36.060 --> 00:37.230
Hey.

00:38.180 --> 00:40.520
Karasuno's got some third-years left.

00:40.520 --> 00:41.600
Yeah.

00:41.600 --> 00:44.690
Now, how is our new team doing?

00:46.230 --> 00:46.650
Makki!

00:50.110 --> 00:51.490
Yeah!

00:52.280 --> 00:54.580
Damn, they're seeing right through them.

00:54.580 --> 00:59.790
Great, great, Takahiro!
 Push it, push it, Takahiro! Do it again!

01:05.420 --> 01:06.170
Sorry!

01:06.170 --> 01:06.960
Kogane!

01:06.960 --> 01:08.420
Got it!

01:08.970 --> 01:11.430
Date Tech has a new setter.

01:11.430 --> 01:12.390
Yeah.

01:12.760 --> 01:13.800
I wonder what kind of set he'll...

01:15.890 --> 01:17.470
What the heck was that?!

01:17.930 --> 01:17.930

01:24.400 --> 01:28.610

Let the headwinds guide your approach

Leap and fly! High!

02:16.030 --> 02:20.700
Let your wings, glistening with blood, sweat, and tears

Take you to wherever you need to go

02:23.330 --> 02:26.130
Unleash your unrefined impulses

02:26.130 --> 02:29.130
Uncover your instincts and bare your uncut fangs

02:29.130 --> 02:31.010
It may take an arduous path

02:31.010 --> 02:33.220
But be torn down it endlessly to achieve your dream

02:33.220 --> 02:36.220

02:53.440 --> 02:55.320
Yeah! Go!

02:55.320 --> 02:58.200
Kogane's movements still seem rough.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.410
Well, as long as the ball goes up.

03:00.410 --> 03:01.370

03:05.290 --> 03:06.580

03:16.180 --> 03:17.720
All right!

03:20.680 --> 03:22.310
Sorry!

03:22.010 --> 03:23.100
Good job, guys!

03:22.310 --> 03:24.770
Shake it off, Futakuchi!

03:24.770 --> 03:27.520
Y-You need to set it a little lower, Koganegawa.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.690
Right! Lower!

03:29.690 --> 03:33.320
Don't make it too low, though. I need it in between.

03:33.320 --> 03:33.940
Right!

03:34.400 --> 03:36.610
Do you really understand that?

03:36.610 --> 03:37.860
Of course!

03:40.530 --> 03:44.120
OlÃ©!

03:44.120 --> 03:45.000
Sorry.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.290
No worries!

03:47.040 --> 03:51.130
Date Tech's setter is a first-year, right?

03:51.130 --> 03:51.880
Yeah.

03:55.840 --> 03:57.180
He's really tall...

03:56.170 --> 03:57.180
I hit it!

03:57.720 --> 03:59.760
Yeah, he is.

03:59.760 --> 04:02.050
That's our new weapon.

04:04.060 --> 04:07.230
The giant setter, Koganegawa.

04:08.560 --> 04:09.600
<i>Giant...</i>

04:09.600 --> 04:11.020
<i>...setter?</i>

04:15.440 --> 04:16.150
<i>Huh?</i>

04:25.120 --> 04:26.410
Nice catch!

04:26.410 --> 04:28.000
I'm sorry!

04:28.000 --> 04:30.170
I'll do a hundred laps around the school to make up for it!

04:30.170 --> 04:32.380
You should be practicing setting with that time!

04:32.380 --> 04:35.050
H-He's still learning!

04:35.050 --> 04:36.760
He just became a setter!

04:36.760 --> 04:38.720
He'll be a huge deal eventually!

04:38.720 --> 04:41.590
Th-Those kinds of mistakes happen all the time...

04:40.680 --> 04:45.600
Well, um, he really has good potential! It's true!

04:41.590 --> 04:45.180
<i>You're making Karasuno's captain take pity on you, Moniwa.</i>

04:47.140 --> 04:48.600
Give us a good serve!

04:49.480 --> 04:54.570
I used to be pretty cheeky, 
so I'm sure I was quite a pain for my upperclassmen,

04:51.480 --> 04:52.560
Bring it!

04:55.020 --> 04:57.070
All right, bring it!

04:55.980 --> 04:58.990
but I think being too serious all the time is a problem too.

04:58.990 --> 05:01.910
Futakuchi is having trouble with his junior.

05:02.530 --> 05:04.200
Serves him right!

05:07.160 --> 05:09.660
They can't afford to let them extend the lead.

05:07.870 --> 05:08.910
Bring it!

05:10.460 --> 05:12.210
You guys gotta stop it before it starts.

05:12.500 --> 05:13.420
Left!

05:14.170 --> 05:17.710
<i>He's going for a setter dump, 
and he's up high above the block, but...</i>

05:19.220 --> 05:20.630
<i>it's completely obvious!</i>

05:20.630 --> 05:21.840
Huh?

05:21.840 --> 05:22.800
Damn it.

05:22.800 --> 05:23.590
Here's our chance!

05:23.590 --> 05:24.100
Iwa!

05:26.680 --> 05:27.930
Nice, Sakunami!

05:27.930 --> 05:29.390
Finish it, Futakuchi!

05:30.430 --> 05:31.270
I touched it!

05:31.270 --> 05:32.480
Got it!

05:32.480 --> 05:32.980
Makki!

05:33.270 --> 05:34.440
Okay!

05:34.440 --> 05:37.530
<i>Number three, a wing spiker, is going to set?</i>

05:41.820 --> 05:43.030
Oikawa!

05:43.450 --> 05:44.370
Oikawa!

06:12.600 --> 06:13.310
Shake it off.

06:13.310 --> 06:14.980
Nice block, Kogane!

06:17.270 --> 06:19.570
Learn to hold back, you idiot!

06:19.570 --> 06:20.900
Right! Sorry!

06:20.900 --> 06:22.860
Are you okay, Futakuchi?!

06:22.860 --> 06:25.870
No, I'm not! That's why I'm
 telling you to learn to hold back!

06:26.200 --> 06:28.530
It's my fault for not being able to support everyone.

06:29.410 --> 06:30.330
You were fine.

06:30.330 --> 06:31.120
Yessir!

06:33.500 --> 06:34.870
That...

06:37.670 --> 06:40.960
is our new Iron Wall, Koganegawa.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.090
<i>New...</i>

06:44.090 --> 06:45.340
<i>...Iron Wall.</i>

06:46.640 --> 06:50.060
<i>He reworded it because it didn't work out so well earlier.</i>

06:50.810 --> 06:54.060
Looks like we're up against an annoying team again.

06:54.060 --> 06:56.020
To be honest, that was sort of refreshing.

06:56.020 --> 06:56.730
True.

06:56.730 --> 06:58.060
I can hear you, you know!

06:59.150 --> 07:01.900
<i>Now then, what to do?</i>

07:03.780 --> 07:04.950
Nice receive!

07:08.410 --> 07:09.200
Got it!

07:10.280 --> 07:11.330
Kindaichi!

07:13.080 --> 07:14.460
A counterattack!

07:13.620 --> 07:15.000
All right!

07:14.460 --> 07:15.790
They really are good.

07:15.790 --> 07:18.500
There you go again! It's way too obvious!

07:18.500 --> 07:22.590
Sorry, but a setter dump looks really cool,
 so I can't help myself!

07:22.590 --> 07:24.760
<i>And that's why it's so obvious.</i>

07:27.470 --> 07:30.970
Look, you don't need to tip it over when you do a setter dump.

07:31.260 --> 07:32.260
<i>Huh?</i>

07:32.260 --> 07:33.140
What?

07:33.680 --> 07:36.140
Date Tech             Aoba Jousai

07:33.680 --> 07:36.140
Date Tech             Aoba Jousai

07:34.390 --> 07:35.690
Give us a good serve!

07:36.600 --> 07:38.270
C'mon, Oikawa!

07:41.820 --> 07:45.070
OlÃ©!

07:46.700 --> 07:49.910
<b>Rule the Court</b>

07:46.700 --> 07:49.910
<b>Rule the Court</b>

07:47.030 --> 07:48.490
All right!

07:50.490 --> 07:54.330
It looks like Seijou has the upper hand.

07:54.330 --> 07:57.620
Date Tech is still flailing around.

07:58.870 --> 08:03.090
Once their giant setter settles in,
 I'm sure he'll be an amazing weapon.

07:59.830 --> 08:01.790
Give us another good serve, Oikawa!

08:03.840 --> 08:06.550
OlÃ©!

08:10.220 --> 08:11.430
Damn it!

08:11.430 --> 08:12.680
It's going over the net!

08:12.680 --> 08:13.890
Here's our chance!

08:13.890 --> 08:15.600
Another fast attack is coming!

08:15.600 --> 08:16.020
Left!

08:16.020 --> 08:16.350
Center!

08:16.890 --> 08:18.140
Number twelve!

08:18.850 --> 08:19.560
Listen up.

08:20.520 --> 08:24.030
Koganegawa's basically still a baby as a setter.

08:25.440 --> 08:29.320
So you need to literally guide him along, Sakunami.

08:30.700 --> 08:33.080
<i>Go somewhere convenient for Koganegawa...</i>

08:36.370 --> 08:37.460
<i>and receive!</i>

08:37.830 --> 08:38.830
Good!

08:39.540 --> 08:44.500
When you receive the ball, 
get it high enough for Koganegawa to do a jumping set.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.510
It doesn't matter how close it is to the net.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.760
He'll get it.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.930
<i>You don't need to try anything fancy yet.</i>

08:56.770 --> 08:58.890
<i>Just get it from one high place...</i>

08:59.310 --> 09:00.850
<i>...to another!</i>

09:03.440 --> 09:07.230
Nice spike, Aone!

09:03.440 --> 09:06.690
Date Tech             Aoba Jousai

09:03.440 --> 09:06.690
Date Tech             Aoba Jousai

09:08.030 --> 09:10.400
So fast! So high!

09:11.530 --> 09:14.700
He put it right where the spiker was going to hit it.

09:14.700 --> 09:19.660
That's definitely a combo that's only possible because of how high up the setter can get.

09:21.830 --> 09:23.210
Nice set, Kogane!

09:22.880 --> 09:25.540
A set that takes advantage of his height...

09:23.210 --> 09:24.210
Thanks!

09:26.300 --> 09:29.420
That huge setter's pretty interesting.

Date Tech             Aoba Jousai

09:44.060 --> 09:47.530
Date Tech             Aoba Jousai

09:46.440 --> 09:47.530
We're gonna catch up!

09:47.820 --> 09:49.740
Get a block here!

09:49.740 --> 09:52.110
Give us a good serve, Jingo!

09:53.280 --> 09:54.370
Got it!

09:54.370 --> 09:54.910
Nice receive!

10:01.660 --> 10:03.330
Yeah!

10:04.290 --> 10:06.090
A setter dump!

10:06.090 --> 10:08.920
And I was just thinking how he was laying low today.

10:08.920 --> 10:10.800
Gotta say he's pretty calm.

10:10.800 --> 10:11.760
It's infuriating.

10:11.760 --> 10:28.980
One more point! One more point!

10:11.760 --> 10:14.970
Date Tech                 Aoba Jousai

10:11.760 --> 10:14.970
Date Tech                 Aoba Jousai

10:12.510 --> 10:14.510
Now Seijou is at match point.

10:24.150 --> 10:25.310
Calm down!

10:25.310 --> 10:27.570
Take it one point at a time!

10:27.570 --> 10:29.530
Right!

10:30.570 --> 10:32.440
Give us a good serve, Hanamaki!

10:32.440 --> 10:34.990
OlÃ©!

10:36.240 --> 10:40.330
Seijou has gotten better at serving as a whole.

10:36.570 --> 10:37.240
Nice!

10:37.240 --> 10:38.330
Cover it!

10:40.330 --> 10:41.540
Yeah.

10:41.540 --> 10:42.620
Left!

10:42.620 --> 10:43.370
Futakuchi!

10:43.370 --> 10:44.040
All right!

10:44.040 --> 10:45.500
Go, Futakuchi!

10:48.670 --> 10:50.380
Yeah!

10:50.710 --> 10:52.170
All right!

10:52.170 --> 10:54.430
You see our juniors?!

10:54.430 --> 10:56.840
You'd better be watching!

10:56.840 --> 11:01.220
<i>And now, their first-year setter is back in the front row.</i>

10:58.350 --> 11:01.220
All right!

11:01.220 --> 11:04.060
Give us a good serve, Onagawa!

11:04.850 --> 11:07.440
<i>Futakuchi's the ace and also good at blocking.</i>

11:07.440 --> 11:10.610
<i>It goes without saying that Aone is the core of the Iron Wall.</i>

11:10.610 --> 11:13.530
<i>And then there's the third section, Koganegawa.</i>

11:14.360 --> 11:19.370
<i>Without a doubt, right now, they're the best wall of three blockers in the prefecture.</i>

11:20.780 --> 11:21.910
Give us a good one!

11:24.540 --> 11:26.370
Sorry! It's a bit short!

11:28.670 --> 11:29.380
Iwa!

11:29.380 --> 11:29.880
Yeah!

11:32.920 --> 11:33.670
I hit it!

11:33.670 --> 11:34.510
Pants!

11:34.510 --> 11:35.550
Got it!

11:35.550 --> 11:36.550
Kogane!

11:36.550 --> 11:37.300
Right!

11:38.640 --> 11:42.640
Look, you don't need to tip it over when you do a setter dump.

11:43.270 --> 11:44.060
Huh?

11:44.060 --> 11:44.930
What?

11:47.140 --> 11:48.650
Slam it down.

11:52.980 --> 11:56.450
Whoa! This time, he smashed it down!

11:56.450 --> 11:58.450
Even if you saw it coming, it'd be impossible to dig out.

11:58.910 --> 12:03.040
Yeah! Do it again!

11:58.910 --> 12:01.410
All right! Two in a row!

12:01.410 --> 12:03.620
Date Tech                 Aoba Jousai

12:01.410 --> 12:03.620
Date Tech                 Aoba Jousai

12:04.580 --> 12:05.500
Hey.

12:06.870 --> 12:08.580
Just play normally.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.040
I'll take them on.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.260
Roger that!

12:16.010 --> 12:20.800
Oikawa set the ball away from the net to avoid it getting blocked, right?

12:21.720 --> 12:25.270
Looks like Iwaizumi wasn't too fond of that move.

12:25.270 --> 12:27.890
Well, it does make it harder to hit.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.690
<i>One more point!</i>

12:31.900 --> 12:32.900
Give us a good serve!

12:33.940 --> 12:34.860
Got it!

12:37.950 --> 12:40.110
Nice receive, Saku!

12:40.820 --> 12:42.450
But it's gonna go over the net!

12:47.830 --> 12:48.580
It's up!

12:48.580 --> 12:49.250
Just one more!

12:49.250 --> 12:50.790
Someone get it!

12:49.670 --> 12:50.790
End it here!

12:50.790 --> 12:52.210
Stop it!

12:52.210 --> 12:53.250
Don't let them have it!

12:59.760 --> 13:00.760
Iwa!

13:00.760 --> 13:02.140
Yeah!

13:03.350 --> 13:06.930
<i>Right now, I'm basically a baby as a setter.</i>

13:07.520 --> 13:12.150
<i>If there's anything that I'm not currently lacking compared to my upperclassmen,</i>

13:13.980 --> 13:15.360
<i>it's my height!</i>

13:19.360 --> 13:21.070
<i>We're not going to let it...</i>

13:26.490 --> 13:28.160
<i>end here!</i>

13:29.660 --> 13:31.170
Your resolve is weak,

13:31.750 --> 13:33.380
you first-year brat!

13:48.350 --> 13:49.640
It...

13:49.640 --> 13:52.690
It went right between his arms!

13:54.270 --> 13:55.150
Yes!

13:56.150 --> 13:58.690
That was awesome, Iwaizumi!

13:58.030 --> 14:00.860
You awesome guy!

13:58.690 --> 14:00.860
You're amazing, Iwaizumi!

14:00.860 --> 14:02.030
Nice spike.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.660
I guess I still have a lot to learn.

14:06.200 --> 14:09.620
He took those three blockers head-on.

14:10.160 --> 14:12.330
I hate to admit it, but that was awesome.

14:23.470 --> 14:26.180
Date Tech             Aoba Jousai

14:23.470 --> 14:26.180
Date Tech             Aoba Jousai

14:26.720 --> 14:28.640
Thank you very much for the match!

14:30.850 --> 14:33.980
I guess we know who we'll face next.

14:40.190 --> 14:41.320
Line up.

14:41.320 --> 14:42.030
Ugh!

14:42.320 --> 14:45.490
What do you mean, "ugh"?! Futakuchi, you asshole!

14:50.370 --> 14:52.870
You still suck, Kogane!

14:52.870 --> 14:54.500
I'm sorry!

14:54.500 --> 14:57.380
And you totally have your hands full, Mr. New Captain.

14:57.380 --> 14:59.380
Do you understand how important Moniwa was now?

14:59.380 --> 15:01.340
I've known his worth for a while.

15:01.840 --> 15:03.340
Good grief...

15:03.340 --> 15:05.260
I see nothing but room for growth!

15:06.260 --> 15:09.140
And there's definitely a lot of room to grow.

15:12.680 --> 15:13.770
Keep working hard.

15:13.770 --> 15:15.770
Work even harder than you have been.

15:15.770 --> 15:19.900
You guys can form the best Iron Wall yet.

15:21.940 --> 15:24.450
Let's go, then.

15:24.450 --> 15:25.200
<i>Huh?</i>

15:26.200 --> 15:31.080
The fact that you guys are here means you have time on your hands, right?

15:31.540 --> 15:33.370
Let's go back so you can practice with us.

15:33.370 --> 15:34.080
What?

15:34.080 --> 15:36.920
I guess we don't have much of a choice!

15:36.920 --> 15:38.540
Don't start stripping here.

15:38.540 --> 15:42.670
Kamasaki, you haven't bulked up so much that you can't jump anymore, have you?

15:42.670 --> 15:43.960
Huh? What do you mean?

15:43.960 --> 15:45.800
Well, muscles are heavy.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.630
What? Really?

15:47.630 --> 15:48.430
I'll...

15:49.300 --> 15:52.060
I'll get to the point where I can set any ball that comes my way!

15:52.060 --> 15:53.720
And I'll be able to block!

15:54.100 --> 15:58.940
So that I won't shame the title of the Iron Wall, I'll make sure I'm able to stop anyone,

15:59.230 --> 16:01.150
no matter how big or strong they are!

16:06.320 --> 16:11.740
Opponents that are hard to stop aren't always big or strong.

16:21.210 --> 16:22.460
<i>Hinata Shouyou...</i>

16:23.090 --> 16:26.630
<i>I'll make sure to stop you next time.</i>

16:55.330 --> 16:57.500
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

16:55.330 --> 16:57.500
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

17:50.670 --> 17:54.850
I-Is everyone on edge for some reason?

17:55.680 --> 17:59.640
Last time, they gave their all against Aoba Jousai,

18:00.270 --> 18:02.390
yet they still lost.

18:04.020 --> 18:05.560
Y-Yachi.

18:05.560 --> 18:06.360
Yes?!

18:07.610 --> 18:09.780
Do you have any antacids?

18:09.780 --> 18:12.070
Are you all right, Yamaguchi?!

18:12.070 --> 18:12.820
Shimizu!

18:12.820 --> 18:15.490
Sorry, I'm just a little nervous.

18:15.490 --> 18:19.750
I-I'm pretty confident when it comes to being nervous!

18:19.750 --> 18:22.290
Huh? Confident about being nervous?

18:22.580 --> 18:25.330
It's better to say something than keep it bottled up.

18:25.330 --> 18:32.260
You'll feel much better if you instead say, "I'm so nervous! What should I do?!"

18:32.260 --> 18:37.550
I often experience live-threatening fear because of my nerves, so I've done a lot of research.

18:37.550 --> 18:38.930
Life-threatening?

18:38.930 --> 18:41.020
Like sports festivals or tests!

18:41.020 --> 18:41.980
Tests?

18:44.650 --> 18:45.520
Well...

18:45.520 --> 18:46.480
Yes?

18:47.980 --> 18:49.860
In our interhigh prelims match against Seijou,

18:50.820 --> 18:52.440
when the team was in trouble,

18:53.200 --> 18:55.990
I was brought in as a pinch server for the first time.

18:57.280 --> 19:00.160
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

18:57.280 --> 19:00.160
Aoba Jousai                    Karasuno

18:58.240 --> 19:00.160
We were only down a few points.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.870
If I'd landed the serve, we might've been able to win.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.050
But I blew it.

19:13.050 --> 19:15.880
When I think about that happening again...

19:17.180 --> 19:17.930
You...

19:19.760 --> 19:22.680
You were put in charge of something that important?!

19:24.180 --> 19:25.190
Yachi?!

19:25.190 --> 19:26.560
I'm so nervous!

19:26.560 --> 19:29.400
It feels like my heart is going to come right out of my mouth!

19:29.400 --> 19:30.770
Swallow it down!

19:30.770 --> 19:32.690
Do you need antacids?

19:32.690 --> 19:34.610
A heart stimulant?! An AED?!

19:34.610 --> 19:35.400
What's going on?!

19:35.400 --> 19:36.950
Yachi's heart!

19:36.950 --> 19:39.070
Her heart!

19:37.740 --> 19:39.070
Calm down, Yamaguchi!

19:39.070 --> 19:40.410
Should we call the cops?!

19:40.410 --> 19:42.410
You mean an ambulance?

19:42.830 --> 19:44.870
Hey, where're you going?

19:43.120 --> 19:47.420
I wonder if nerves are like a cold and you get better when you give it to someone else.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.170
You all seem better than before.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.380
Why are you trying to explain this rationally?

19:55.590 --> 19:58.260
Are you freaking out before the match too, Kageyama?

20:00.800 --> 20:01.640
Yeah.

20:02.680 --> 20:04.600
Oikawa's really good.

20:05.600 --> 20:08.230
You sure can't handle the Great King, huh?

20:08.230 --> 20:09.770
Well, not like it's any different for me.

20:09.770 --> 20:12.190
You were looking forward to taking him on, weren't you?

20:12.190 --> 20:14.780
You can't control what freaks you out.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.410
"The team that's better as six is better."

20:19.410 --> 20:20.490
Huh?

20:21.240 --> 20:25.160
I overheard Iwaizumi say that to Oikawa once.

20:26.540 --> 20:30.170
The team that's better as six is better, dumbass!

20:30.170 --> 20:34.460
At the time, I was wondering why he said something so obvious.

20:35.630 --> 20:40.180
Of course a team of six good players would be good.

20:41.930 --> 20:43.890
But now I really understand him.

20:43.890 --> 20:48.440
Iwaizumi wasn't talking about 
adding everyone's strengths together.

20:48.440 --> 20:51.060
He was talking about multiplying them.

20:52.690 --> 20:57.690
No matter what team he's on, Oikawa can draw 
out the strength of each spiker better than I can.

21:04.280 --> 21:05.660
Really?

21:05.660 --> 21:07.370
Even if you're right...

21:09.710 --> 21:12.460
that only applies to teams other than us!

21:16.590 --> 21:18.760
Okay, is everyone here?

21:20.510 --> 21:22.140
It's almost time.

21:32.440 --> 21:34.270
All right, let's go!

21:34.560 --> 21:36.780
Yeah!

21:57.000 --> 21:57.000
{ED}

22:09.270 --> 22:13.400
When I was just a nobody, something lit up my eyes

22:13.400 --> 22:19.190
I was merely a guy languishing complacently in the dark, happy with what I had

22:13.400 --> 22:19.190
I was merely a guy languishing complacently in the dark, happy with what I had

22:19.190 --> 22:23.610
Now I'm torn toward the heavens even on a starless night

22:23.610 --> 22:28.660
Whether our time comes to us or not is a matter for those in another world

22:28.700 --> 22:38.880
That's right, our lungs pumping and our hearts beating is all we have in this new realm

22:28.700 --> 22:38.880
That's right, our lungs pumping and our hearts beating is all we have in this new realm

22:38.880 --> 22:44.010
We've always been dancing on an unlit stage, but now beyond that

22:44.010 --> 22:50.810
We're awaiting the rising of a sun that none have yet witnessed

22:50.810 --> 22:56.730
Now that we're deliberating at a crossroads, paths blurring together

22:50.810 --> 22:56.730
Now that we're deliberating at a crossroads, paths blurring together

22:57.270 --> 22:59.360
We can feel it

22:57.270 --> 22:59.360
We can feel it

22:59.360 --> 23:04.490
Inside this uncharted world which has yet to take on a name

23:04.490 --> 23:10.740
As I'm waiting for the dawn to reach my eyes with a familiar light

23:10.740 --> 23:17.670
I'm reminded of days I won't return to, and seeking proof of newfound existence

23:17.670 --> 23:20.500
We brace ourselves

23:26.470 --> 23:26.470
{Outro}

23:41.320 --> 23:43.280
<i>We're going to get revenge...</i>

23:43.650 --> 23:44.740
<i>...with our new fast attack!</i>

23:46.070 --> 23:46.070
{Preview}

23:46.780 --> 23:48.450
<i>I'd like another pork bowl, ma'am!</i>

23:48.450 --> 23:50.280
<i>You're eating way too much. That's your fourth one!</i>

23:50.280 --> 23:54.620
<i>In order for me to become the best Iron Wall,
 I'm gonna try to grow until I reach two meters tall!</i>

23:54.620 --> 23:57.790
<i>What you need to grow is your skills, not your height.</i>

23:57.000 --> 24:01.090
Episode Twenty: 
Sweep Clear

23:57.000 --> 24:01.090
Episode Twenty: 
Sweep Clear

23:57.790 --> 23:59.080
<i>Next time on </i>Haikyuu!!<i>:</i>

23:59.080 --> 24:00.130
