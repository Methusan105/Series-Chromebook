WEBVTT

00:03.400 --> 00:10.030
Man, it's crazy how we played more than 60 sets and only won three.

00:09.660 --> 00:11.780
Manabu! Come on, drink up.

00:10.030 --> 00:11.780
We've walked quite a difficult road.

00:11.780 --> 00:14.410
No, thanks. If I drink any more, I'll definitely feel it tomorrow.

00:13.370 --> 00:14.410
That's for sure.

00:14.410 --> 00:16.500
It won't affect us!

00:15.290 --> 00:20.380
Though if they played like they did in the Seijou match, 
we could've won a few more sets.

00:20.750 --> 00:24.590
Manabu, are you saying you're too good for my sake?

00:21.170 --> 00:26.880
The team's offense was focused around Hinata and Kageyama's deviant fast attack and their bait routine,

00:24.590 --> 00:26.340
No, um...

00:26.340 --> 00:28.420
I'm just kidding!

00:26.880 --> 00:28.840
and they executed it well.

00:29.720 --> 00:32.300
But the limits of that strategy were in sight.

00:33.260 --> 00:35.310
And they hit that limit when they lost to Seijou.

00:35.890 --> 00:38.060
That's why they started changing things up.

00:38.060 --> 00:39.770
I know.

00:40.480 --> 00:43.480
Right now, they're each making their own gear.

00:43.940 --> 00:47.740
It's still a work in progress, and they stand no 
chance against a powerhouse team from Kanto.

00:48.610 --> 00:51.700
But if those gears all line up...

00:56.740 --> 01:00.920
Hey! Don't think that you'll win against Nekoma that easily!

01:00.920 --> 01:03.330
Easily? I would never think that!

01:03.840 --> 01:06.050
But we'll be eagerly looking for the chance to win!

01:06.340 --> 01:08.630
You sure talk big now, Takeda.

01:09.550 --> 01:10.680
You too, Ukai!

01:11.260 --> 01:14.260
Karasuno               Fukurodani

01:11.260 --> 01:14.260
Karasuno               Fukurodani

01:14.600 --> 01:16.640
This is the final set.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.680
We've been losing this entire training camp.

01:18.680 --> 01:23.150
Let's try to rip at least one set away from the most powerful team at this training camp, Fukurodani,

01:23.560 --> 01:25.900
before going home!

01:26.190 --> 01:28.360
Yeah!

01:29.900 --> 01:32.910
<i>I'll show you the results of this training camp!</i>

01:34.950 --> 01:34.950
{OP}

01:44.040 --> 01:48.920
I keep running as I run out of breath

01:48.920 --> 01:53.840
With dreams on my mind and a fire in my belly

I feel like I'll be left behind in this world

01:58.770 --> 02:03.440
If I come to a standstill

02:03.900 --> 02:08.610
People ask me why I find joy in this

02:08.610 --> 02:13.200
But I don't understand it myself

02:13.660 --> 02:18.080
Running is the only thing on my mind

02:18.080 --> 02:22.250
Even if nothing goes right in the future

02:22.250 --> 02:27.880
I won't stop trying to find the best version of myself

02:27.880 --> 02:32.170
Even if someone tells me that this is as far as I go

02:32.170 --> 02:34.260
And draws the line on me

02:34.260 --> 02:38.220
I'll say no, thank you, and surge on ahead

02:38.850 --> 02:39.680
So what?

02:39.680 --> 02:41.310
Whatever the future may bring

02:41.310 --> 02:42.020
So what?

02:42.020 --> 02:43.810
However people are supposed to act

02:43.810 --> 02:44.560
So what?

02:44.560 --> 02:48.230
It doesn't really matter

02:50.230 --> 02:53.190
So I'm a believer

02:55.150 --> 03:00.950
So I'm a believer

Gears

03:13.840 --> 03:16.300
Karasuno               Fukurodani

03:13.840 --> 03:16.300
Karasuno               Fukurodani

03:14.220 --> 03:16.300
Let's have a good match!

03:16.590 --> 03:18.010
Let's start off strong!

03:18.010 --> 03:19.010
Yeah!

03:19.010 --> 03:21.720
All right! Bring it, Karasuno!

03:24.270 --> 03:26.020
Give us a good serve, Asahi!

03:32.530 --> 03:33.740
It's a bit off!

03:34.190 --> 03:35.150
Bokuto!

03:35.150 --> 03:35.700
Right!

03:36.070 --> 03:37.110
Left! Number four!

03:37.110 --> 03:38.950
Tighten up for the straight spike.

03:38.950 --> 03:40.660
It'll get through if there's even the tiniest gap.

03:44.250 --> 03:45.290
It's out!

03:46.710 --> 03:48.210
Yes!

03:47.290 --> 03:48.540
Damn, it went out of bounds.

03:48.540 --> 03:49.420
So close!

03:49.420 --> 03:51.670
Don't worry about it, Tsukishima! You almost had it!

03:49.710 --> 03:52.880
It really pisses me off how you
 guys keep improving day by day.

03:51.670 --> 03:52.300
Right.

03:52.880 --> 03:54.460
Left, left!

03:52.880 --> 03:54.960
Karasuno               Fukurodani

03:52.880 --> 03:54.960
Karasuno               Fukurodani

03:56.510 --> 03:58.090
Whoa, he got it!

03:58.090 --> 03:59.090
But it's way off course!

04:03.680 --> 04:05.930
A fast attack from there?!

04:05.930 --> 04:09.900
Even if the receive is a little off, 
they confidently pull off a fast attack.

04:10.480 --> 04:12.860
Their setter's pretty skilled too.

04:11.060 --> 04:11.980
Give us a good serve.

04:12.860 --> 04:15.190
Stop them here!

04:15.190 --> 04:17.700
Their number four is up front now.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.280
Now I can finally hit up front.

04:18.280 --> 04:19.740
Give us a good one!

04:20.780 --> 04:21.950
Nishinoya!

04:21.950 --> 04:23.450
Nice receive!

04:25.080 --> 04:26.250
Nice, Saru!

04:26.250 --> 04:27.660
Let me finish it off!

04:28.500 --> 04:31.460
Our current rotation has the tallest wall of blocks in the front row.

04:32.080 --> 04:33.670
Make sure you stop the ball!

04:37.630 --> 04:40.840
That's an insane cut shot.

04:40.840 --> 04:45.470
A strong hit that cuts in front of three blockers is very difficult to execute.

04:45.470 --> 04:48.310
It can be hard on your shoulders if they're not flexible.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.730
All right!

04:52.190 --> 04:53.650
Did you see that, Akaashi?

04:53.650 --> 04:56.690
Hey, did you see my awesome cut shot just now?

04:56.690 --> 04:58.990
I did. It was amazing.

04:58.990 --> 05:00.070
It was pure luck, though!

05:00.570 --> 05:02.570
Bokuto is so annoying.

05:02.910 --> 05:05.330
That's amazing, even if it was luck.

05:05.330 --> 05:06.620
I'd love to hit a spike like that.

05:07.290 --> 05:10.830
Bokuto from Fukurodani is a truly strange player.

05:10.830 --> 05:13.540
Hey, can I try hitting that again?

05:11.960 --> 05:16.420
Even when he's your opponent, 
you kind of want to cheer for him.

05:13.540 --> 05:14.590
I wanna do it again!

05:14.590 --> 05:16.710
The other team's completely on to you, Bokuto.

05:16.420 --> 05:19.170
Though I think that might be because he's on a completely different level.

05:16.710 --> 05:18.460
Oh crap! My bad.

05:18.460 --> 05:19.920
Maybe I'll go for a straight spike, then.

05:20.260 --> 05:21.590
Yeah...

05:22.300 --> 05:26.470
He might just be a player who lifts the spirits of both his teammates and his opponents.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.810
Karasuno               Fukurodani

05:27.100 --> 05:28.810
Karasuno               Fukurodani

05:29.310 --> 05:30.430
Yeah!

05:30.430 --> 05:31.940
Give us a good serve, Tsukishima!

05:32.560 --> 05:33.690
<i>A special attack?!</i>

05:33.690 --> 05:34.400
<i>Yep!</i>

05:35.110 --> 05:40.360
Listen closely. This attack is best described as something born from upsetting the balance of stillness and motion.

05:40.360 --> 05:43.530
Whoa! Whoa...

05:42.700 --> 05:44.950
There he goes, trying to sound all cool again.

05:44.950 --> 05:47.160
Do you have any clue what he's talking about?

05:47.160 --> 05:48.580
I have an idea.

05:48.580 --> 05:52.250
This attack isn't something you 
use to run away from the enemy.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.380
With perfect timing, a perfect set, a perfect position for spiking...

05:58.380 --> 06:01.840
Just when everyone thinks a powerful spike is incoming...

06:01.840 --> 06:07.390
And more than anything, the moment when you think 
you can land a powerful shot is the perfect opportunity!

06:08.010 --> 06:09.220
I got this!

06:09.810 --> 06:10.850
Nice receive!

06:13.100 --> 06:16.270
<i>Like you're laughing at them, really go for it!</i>

06:19.530 --> 06:20.480
Hinata just...

06:22.950 --> 06:23.950
tipped it over!

06:26.120 --> 06:31.250
When the tip succeeds, there's a great feeling 
that's totally different than when you land a spike.

06:32.160 --> 06:36.420
You know how a few people will dive for the falling ball?

06:36.420 --> 06:37.500
Yeah.

06:37.500 --> 06:44.590
You're usually eye level with them or higher, but when they try to reach for the ball, miss, and then look up...

06:47.890 --> 06:49.720
<i>It's the best feeling.</i>

06:53.980 --> 06:56.900
A tip?!

06:57.560 --> 07:00.110
You're the one who taught it to him.

07:03.490 --> 07:06.240
You actually used your head?

07:06.240 --> 07:07.660
You're gonna get a fever.

07:07.660 --> 07:10.950
You're the only one who doesn't get to say stuff like that to me.

07:10.950 --> 07:11.950
Hmph!

07:11.950 --> 07:14.750
I won't let them score another point!

07:14.750 --> 07:16.870
I think it's impossible to completely shut them out.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.170
Back me up once in a while, Akaashi!

07:19.170 --> 07:21.170
Damn you, Shorty!

07:21.170 --> 07:23.260
We're not gonna lose!

07:23.840 --> 07:25.840
Karasuno               Fukurodani

07:23.840 --> 07:25.840
Karasuno               Fukurodani

07:24.630 --> 07:25.840
Number two!

07:27.640 --> 07:28.340
All right!

07:29.100 --> 07:30.300
Ready, and...

07:30.970 --> 07:34.730
They all seem to be enjoying themselves.

07:31.560 --> 07:32.470
I touched it!

07:32.470 --> 07:33.430
Got it!

07:34.730 --> 07:37.020
I wonder if Bokuto has something to do with it.

07:40.020 --> 07:42.440
Wow, a setter dump!

07:42.440 --> 07:44.690
Kageyama is doing well too!

07:44.690 --> 07:47.490
His jump serves have been on point.

07:47.490 --> 07:53.450
Yeah, he's really calm and collected today.

07:53.450 --> 07:56.790
It's scary like the calm before the storm.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.460
Give us another good serve, Tsukishima!

08:00.250 --> 08:06.470
<i>I feel like everything I ate this morning is gone from my stomach, yet I'm still not hungry.</i>

08:07.380 --> 08:11.470
<i>My body's more responsive than usual,
 and I can clearly see what everyone else is doing.</i>

08:12.350 --> 08:15.220
<i>Even I can tell I'm playing well today.</i>

08:17.520 --> 08:18.600
All right!

08:17.890 --> 08:19.690
<i>The same goes for everyone else.</i>

08:18.600 --> 08:19.690
Nice, Daichi!

08:19.690 --> 08:20.650
<i>Is it because of the barbecue?</i>

08:22.980 --> 08:24.730
<i>Hinata's doing well too.</i>

08:24.730 --> 08:26.280
<i>He's making no unnecessary movements.</i>

08:26.860 --> 08:27.990
<i>We just might</i>

08:28.740 --> 08:31.070
<i>be able to do the new fast attack.</i>

08:32.910 --> 08:33.740
<i>But...</i>

08:35.450 --> 08:37.370
Nice receive, Asahi!

08:40.540 --> 08:42.170
<i>Is he planning on doing the new fast attack?</i>

08:42.920 --> 08:47.210
<i>If we mess it up, we could destroy the good mood the team has developed.</i>

08:47.840 --> 08:51.140
<i>We should hold off until the chance of success is higher.</i>

08:51.470 --> 08:52.390
<i>You're not gonna do it?</i>

09:08.610 --> 09:09.530
<i>The ball comes...</i>

09:11.530 --> 09:12.490
<i>and then...</i>

09:13.820 --> 09:14.700
<i>it stops.</i>

09:30.220 --> 09:31.470
Wait! What the hell was that?!

09:31.470 --> 09:32.930
If we're gonna do that, tell me beforehand!

09:32.930 --> 09:36.010
I just felt like we could pull it off! Didn't you feel it too?!

09:36.010 --> 09:38.850
I did, but it was too sudden!

09:36.350 --> 09:38.850
What the hell? Is that weird fast attack back?

09:38.850 --> 09:39.930
Not quite.

09:38.850 --> 09:41.730
I've gotta mentally prepare and stuff!

09:41.730 --> 09:45.440
That was different from the fast attack they did before.

09:41.730 --> 09:44.810
It's fine since we totally nailed it, right?!

09:44.810 --> 09:45.820
Wrong!

09:45.820 --> 09:47.110
C'mon! Let's do it again!

09:48.280 --> 09:49.070
The first gear

09:50.280 --> 09:51.280
is in place.

09:53.320 --> 10:00.080

09:53.320 --> 10:00.080

10:11.420 --> 10:12.380

10:13.550 --> 10:14.260

10:18.100 --> 10:18.600
Karasuno                    Fukurodani

10:18.100 --> 10:18.600
Karasuno                    Fukurodani

10:18.600 --> 10:19.220
Karasuno                    Fukurodani

10:18.600 --> 10:19.220
Karasuno                    Fukurodani

10:19.220 --> 10:19.350
Karasuno                    Fukurodani

10:19.220 --> 10:19.350
Karasuno                    Fukurodani

10:19.350 --> 10:19.470
Karasuno                    Fukurodani

10:19.350 --> 10:19.470
Karasuno                    Fukurodani

10:19.470 --> 10:19.600
Karasuno                    Fukurodani

10:19.470 --> 10:19.600
Karasuno                    Fukurodani

10:19.600 --> 10:21.060
Karasuno                    Fukurodani

10:19.600 --> 10:21.060
Karasuno                    Fukurodani

10:23.810 --> 10:26.480
All right!

10:26.810 --> 10:27.770
All right!

10:26.810 --> 10:29.360
What the heck was that?! It was awesome!

10:29.360 --> 10:31.320
Nice job, Hinata, Kageyama!

10:31.320 --> 10:34.410
Hey, Akaashi. Was it really that amazing?

10:34.410 --> 10:36.160
Could we do it too?

10:36.160 --> 10:39.290
That's something we should never try.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.370
Hinata hit it like it was nothing,

10:42.370 --> 10:46.080
but I think that set is really hard to hit unless you're used to it.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.250
Not to mention,

10:47.920 --> 10:52.460
making a set float at the point of 
impact is incredible. I couldn't do it.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.180
<i>You're not gonna do it?</i>

10:55.550 --> 10:58.430
<i>He dragged me along again. Dammit.</i>

10:56.140 --> 10:58.430
What? You wanna start somethin'?

10:58.800 --> 11:01.140
That was awesome! So cool!

11:01.140 --> 11:02.520
It stopped right before my eyes!

11:02.520 --> 11:03.890
It was like, "shoop"!

11:03.890 --> 11:06.100
I was totally sure it was gonna finally work!

11:06.100 --> 11:08.400
But when it actually stopped in front of my eyes, it freaked me out!

11:08.940 --> 11:11.070
You really <i>are</i> amazing!

11:13.240 --> 11:15.150
Wh-What're you saying, you moron...

11:15.150 --> 11:17.070
Amazing! You're so amazing!

11:17.570 --> 11:20.740
The look on Kageyama's face defies description.

11:17.870 --> 11:20.080
You're so awesome, Kageyama!

11:20.740 --> 11:23.040
What's up with his facial muscles?

11:23.040 --> 11:27.040
It's not often that Hinata praises Kageyama in a straightforward manner.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.630
I'm glad we actually believed in this and waited.

11:29.630 --> 11:30.290
Yeah.

11:30.710 --> 11:33.260
Anyway, next time, make sure you—

11:32.170 --> 11:33.260
You did it!

11:33.260 --> 11:35.220
You did it! You did it!

11:36.090 --> 11:38.890
Nice spike, Hinata, Kageyama!

11:39.850 --> 11:41.680
<i>They finally succeeded after three weeks.</i>

11:42.140 --> 11:46.640
<i>Ever since that fight, Hinata and Kageyama haven't been on speaking terms.</i>

11:46.640 --> 11:50.690
<i>Yet they both worked hard on improving.</i>

11:50.690 --> 11:51.820
<i>And now...</i>

11:52.820 --> 11:55.900
<i>the deviant duo is back in action!</i>

12:03.790 --> 12:05.040
One more time!

12:06.290 --> 12:07.750
I'm so jealous!

12:07.750 --> 12:09.290
Let me look cool too!

12:09.290 --> 12:10.500
We can't let them beat us.

12:10.500 --> 12:11.630
Let's keep it up!

12:12.040 --> 12:13.630
Hey, hey, hey!

12:13.630 --> 12:15.710
Don't get cocky, you guys!

12:15.710 --> 12:17.760
Hey, hey, hey!

12:16.010 --> 12:20.050
All right!

12:18.380 --> 12:20.050
Shouyou...

12:20.510 --> 12:22.220
always does something new.

12:24.560 --> 12:29.190
If Shorty was on our team, 
would you be a little more motivated?

12:29.190 --> 12:31.440
It'd be impossible to be on the same team as him.

12:31.440 --> 12:32.730
Huh? Why?

12:33.610 --> 12:38.070
I wouldn't be able to keep up with him 
unless I kept coming up with something new.

12:38.070 --> 12:41.990
No matter how cleverly I ditched practice, I'm pretty sure he'd notice.

12:42.740 --> 12:47.830
That first-year setter prodigy hesitated for just a second and Shouyou figured it out.

12:47.830 --> 12:49.710
That'd be exhausting.

12:49.710 --> 12:51.500
I see.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.970
Then would you be properly motivated 
if he was your opponent during practice?

12:58.970 --> 12:59.970
What do you mean?

12:59.970 --> 13:06.770
Because when you watch him play, 
your face looks like it does after you buy a new game.

13:09.310 --> 13:11.020
No, it doesn't.

13:11.020 --> 13:12.650
Actually, what does that face even look like?

13:12.650 --> 13:13.810
Really excited.

13:13.810 --> 13:15.860
What the heck? I don't know what you're talking about.

13:15.860 --> 13:16.690
I don't make that face.

13:16.690 --> 13:17.610
You do.

13:17.610 --> 13:18.780
I do not.

13:20.570 --> 13:21.160
You do.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.160
I do not.

13:22.570 --> 13:24.910
U-Um, Ukai?

13:26.040 --> 13:31.250
To be honest, at first glance, I can't tell the difference between that and the old deviant fast attack.

13:31.250 --> 13:31.870
Oh.

13:32.750 --> 13:36.920
In the previous fast attack, the set would 
go right through Hinata's point of impact.

13:34.380 --> 13:37.460
m 0 0 l 150 0 150 150 0 150

13:34.380 --> 13:37.460
<b>Point of
 Impact</b>

13:36.920 --> 13:39.880
Conversely, with this new fast attack,

13:37.460 --> 13:37.500
m 0 0 l 150 0 150 150 0 150

13:37.460 --> 13:37.500
<b>Point of
 Impact</b>

13:39.880 --> 13:45.100
they're trying to make it so that the spiker's highest point of impact is in the same place as the ball's point of arrival.

13:46.350 --> 13:50.140
Once the ball's forward momentum dies,

13:50.810 --> 13:54.690
there's a brief moment that you wouldn't
 have if the ball was going straight through.

13:55.360 --> 13:58.440
That one moment existing is the difference.

13:58.440 --> 14:01.150
It means Hinata has more options while mid-air.

14:01.150 --> 14:02.150
Oh!

14:04.240 --> 14:07.910
I gotta bring the old man to the spring tourney prelims.

14:08.540 --> 14:11.210
I'll show him their fast attack up close!

14:13.330 --> 14:14.790
Nice receive!

14:15.130 --> 14:17.340
<i>Kill the ball's momentum.</i>

14:17.340 --> 14:18.500
<i>Kill it!</i>

14:26.760 --> 14:29.850
<i>Shit! And everything looked the same as last time too!</i>

14:30.850 --> 14:32.730
All right!

14:32.730 --> 14:33.850
Oh my.

14:33.850 --> 14:35.480
We got lucky!

14:34.480 --> 14:38.820
Did he lose his incredible concentration from earlier?

14:39.190 --> 14:41.070
Shake it off, Kageyama!

14:41.070 --> 14:42.570
That <i>really</i> pisses me off!

14:42.570 --> 14:45.990
Why's that? Besides, what else was I supposed to say?!

14:45.990 --> 14:49.280
Well, it's not something you can always expect to go perfectly...

14:49.660 --> 14:51.290
And what better time...

14:51.290 --> 14:53.000
...for the upperclassmen to shine!

14:53.000 --> 14:55.960
Karasuno               Fukurodani

14:53.000 --> 14:55.960
Karasuno               Fukurodani

14:54.580 --> 14:55.960
One blocker!

14:56.880 --> 14:57.460
I touched it!

15:00.000 --> 15:00.880
Got it!

15:06.930 --> 15:08.180
<i>There's that weird sound again!</i>

15:08.180 --> 15:10.310
<i>But a double hit wasn't called.</i>

15:10.310 --> 15:11.560
The libero's set...

15:13.140 --> 15:16.020
leads to the ace's back row attack!

15:18.400 --> 15:19.440
The second gear

15:20.070 --> 15:21.070
is in place!

15:23.360 --> 15:25.200
It's out?!

15:25.200 --> 15:26.320
That was so close!

15:26.320 --> 15:29.740
Sorry, my set was a bit low! Damn it!

15:29.740 --> 15:31.410
I-It was great!

15:31.410 --> 15:34.120
I think that was more a mistake on my end.

15:34.120 --> 15:37.620
Please say it sucks if it sucks!

15:37.620 --> 15:39.040
Oh, okay...

15:39.040 --> 15:41.840
I-I'd be so happy if the set was a bit higher.

15:39.380 --> 15:41.840
They changed this much in a week?

15:41.840 --> 15:43.460
I know that!

15:41.840 --> 15:43.460
Terrifying.

15:45.130 --> 15:47.260
That's it! Keep it up!

15:50.510 --> 15:56.310
<i>We still lack the experience to be able to go head-to-head with a powerhouse school while they're on guard.</i>

15:56.310 --> 15:57.310
Got it!

15:57.310 --> 15:58.270
Left! Left!

15:58.270 --> 16:00.810
Karasuno               Fukurodani

15:58.270 --> 16:00.810
Karasuno               Fukurodani

15:58.650 --> 15:59.940
Two blockers!

15:58.940 --> 16:00.810
<i>In order for us to win,</i>

16:00.810 --> 16:01.770
We have a chance here!

16:01.440 --> 16:02.730
<i>even if we suck...</i>

16:01.770 --> 16:02.730
We can score!

16:03.150 --> 16:04.110
Got it!

16:05.150 --> 16:07.110
<i>...all we should do is hone our new weapons!</i>

16:08.360 --> 16:08.820
Now!

16:09.450 --> 16:13.450
<i>Multiple spikers almost simultaneously 
make their approach from several directions!</i>

16:14.450 --> 16:16.410
<i>A synchronized attack at first tempo!</i>

16:17.040 --> 16:18.870
<i>The blockers can't narrow in on a target!</i>

16:19.500 --> 16:22.380
<i>Everyone dives in, believing that the set will come to them!</i>

16:34.060 --> 16:36.730
All right!

16:37.310 --> 16:40.190
I nail spike... Seriously feel good...

16:40.190 --> 16:41.190
He's crying.

16:40.190 --> 16:41.190
All right!

16:41.190 --> 16:42.610
He's babbling.

16:42.610 --> 16:46.190
I mean, it's been a while since nailing a spike has felt this satisfying.

16:46.570 --> 16:50.410
Dammit, they're attacking from every which way...

16:50.410 --> 16:52.070
Nice set, Kageyama!

16:52.070 --> 16:53.160
Thank you!

16:53.160 --> 16:54.370
Nice spike, Tanaka!

16:54.740 --> 16:55.700
Thanks!

16:56.620 --> 16:58.960
Keep coming up with something new, huh?

16:58.960 --> 17:00.540
Stay focused!

17:00.540 --> 17:01.880
The third gear

17:01.880 --> 17:03.210
is in place!

17:03.880 --> 17:07.300
That was a synchronized attack at first tempo.

17:07.300 --> 17:08.840
It went so smoothly!

17:08.840 --> 17:09.340
Yeah.

17:10.010 --> 17:14.600
Against their three blockers, our attack had four people advancing at once if you include the back row attack.

17:14.600 --> 17:15.930
They couldn't follow all of them.

17:20.310 --> 17:21.440
Is something wrong?

17:21.440 --> 17:22.150
No.

17:22.980 --> 17:25.360
There's just something I want to try out now.

17:37.040 --> 17:37.910
Damn it!

17:43.330 --> 17:44.880
Yes!

17:45.380 --> 17:47.250
Karasuno's at the top of their game.

17:47.250 --> 17:51.090
The messy attacks they were trying 
on the first day are finally succeeding.

17:52.430 --> 17:53.800
All right!

17:53.800 --> 17:56.510
Karasuno               Fukurodani

17:53.800 --> 17:56.510
Karasuno               Fukurodani

17:55.050 --> 17:56.510
This is going great.

17:57.060 --> 17:59.980
We're actually neck-and-neck with 
Fukurodani at the end of the match.

17:59.980 --> 18:00.730
Yeah!

18:01.060 --> 18:02.770
Don't get overconfident.

18:02.770 --> 18:04.100
The real battle begins now.

18:04.100 --> 18:05.190
Yes, sir!

18:05.480 --> 18:07.520
It's true that you shouldn't let your guard down.

18:07.520 --> 18:12.320
But it's also true that the gears you guys have 
created are starting to mesh with one another.

18:12.740 --> 18:16.620
In the course of fighting out this set, 
please work on honing them even further!

18:16.620 --> 18:17.990
Yessir!

18:18.700 --> 18:25.000
Also, our plan of not letting their ace have free reign is going well.

18:25.540 --> 18:28.800
Well, except for that ridiculous cut shot.

18:29.880 --> 18:32.510
But that was because Tsukishima got a hand on a spike earlier.

18:32.510 --> 18:33.880
Oh, right.

18:34.510 --> 18:37.220
If we can keep number four under control, 
then victory is in sight.

18:37.220 --> 18:38.100
Let's finish this!

18:38.100 --> 18:40.100
Yessir!

18:40.100 --> 18:46.560
We're having a difficult time, but let's stay calm. We can't let Karasuno's attacks faze us.

18:46.560 --> 18:47.190
Yeah!

18:47.190 --> 18:47.690
Right.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.610
Were you listening, Bokuto?

18:51.610 --> 18:53.740
Yeah, of course I was listening!

18:53.740 --> 18:55.950
C'mon, let's do this already.

18:58.660 --> 19:00.540
Do you think that's...

19:06.960 --> 19:09.170
Karasuno                 Fukurodani

19:06.960 --> 19:09.170
Karasuno                 Fukurodani

19:07.750 --> 19:09.170
All right!

19:09.460 --> 19:11.170
Damn it! I'm sorry!

19:11.170 --> 19:13.050
That was our chance to turn things around too!

19:13.050 --> 19:14.420
Don't worry about it!

19:14.420 --> 19:15.760
Nice try, Noya!

19:15.760 --> 19:18.850
All right, I'll leave them in the shadows with my serve!

19:18.850 --> 19:20.310
Give us a good one, Bokuto!

19:22.060 --> 19:23.980
Bokuto, stay calm.

19:23.980 --> 19:24.730
I <i>am</i> calm!

19:25.060 --> 19:27.940
This isn't good. He's losing his temper.

19:28.900 --> 19:31.480
All right! Here I go!

19:34.950 --> 19:38.030
Damn it! I'm sorry!

19:38.030 --> 19:39.530
Just calm down.

19:39.530 --> 19:40.410
Don't worry about it.

19:40.410 --> 19:42.620
I'm sorry!

19:40.410 --> 19:47.120
Karasuno                 Fukurodani

19:40.410 --> 19:47.120
Karasuno                 Fukurodani

19:40.700 --> 19:43.580
Hey, Karasuno caught up with them again.

19:43.580 --> 19:44.580
Yeah.

19:44.580 --> 19:47.120
Are they actually gonna turn the tables at the eleventh hour?

19:47.540 --> 19:49.960
Their number four can spike from any point on the court.

19:49.960 --> 19:52.800
Let's aim for him with our serves to restrict his movement a little.

19:52.800 --> 19:53.840
Got it.

19:56.680 --> 19:58.760
<i>Crap! I aimed for the corner too hard!</i>

19:59.090 --> 20:00.180
You jerk!

20:00.180 --> 20:02.890
<i>Whoa, it barely made it in. I'm so lucky!</i>

20:03.470 --> 20:04.810
Give it to me!

20:04.810 --> 20:06.810
I'll finish this in one hit!

20:07.810 --> 20:11.860
<i>There are few outcomes when setting to Bokuto while he's a bit angry.</i>

20:07.810 --> 20:11.770
Seconds

20:07.810 --> 20:11.770
Seconds

20:11.440 --> 20:30.920
Seconds

20:11.440 --> 20:30.920
Seconds

20:12.440 --> 20:15.820
<i>A: If he scores normally, then there's no problem.</i>

20:13.780 --> 20:15.110
All right!

20:15.820 --> 20:22.910
<i>B: If he messes up or gets blocked again, he may start to feel even worse.</i>

20:22.910 --> 20:24.830
<i>C: If I don't give him the ball...</i>

20:24.830 --> 20:26.330
Hmph! I don't care anymore!

20:26.330 --> 20:28.000
<i>...he may become uncooperative.</i>

20:28.000 --> 20:30.460
<i>C is the most annoying.</i>

20:31.670 --> 20:32.290
Bokuto!

20:32.960 --> 20:33.880
Three blockers!

20:33.880 --> 20:35.170
All right!

20:36.720 --> 20:38.220
Got it!

20:38.220 --> 20:39.680
Give it to me again, Akaashi!

20:41.510 --> 20:42.390
Here.

20:42.390 --> 20:43.680
All right!

20:43.680 --> 20:44.970
Let's stop him this time!

20:44.970 --> 20:46.060
Ready, and...

20:52.980 --> 20:54.860
All right!

20:54.360 --> 21:01.570
Karasuno                 Fukurodani

20:54.360 --> 21:01.570
Karasuno                 Fukurodani

20:54.860 --> 20:57.280
Wow, Karasuno turned it around!

20:57.280 --> 21:00.740
Isn't this the first time they've been in the lead all week?

21:00.740 --> 21:01.570
I think you're right!

21:01.570 --> 21:04.790
W-Was that a block?

21:04.790 --> 21:10.960
No. It didn't go over the net, so it was a failed spike.

21:16.920 --> 21:19.090
<i>Does this mean what I think it means?</i>

21:19.090 --> 21:21.090
<i>Oh boy. It's happening, isn't it?</i>

21:21.090 --> 21:22.510
<i>Really? This quickly?</i>

21:22.510 --> 21:24.350
<i>Wow, already?</i>

21:24.350 --> 21:25.680
<i>That was fast.</i>

21:26.060 --> 21:28.100
<i>Jeez, here it comes.</i>

21:28.100 --> 21:29.310
Akaashi...

21:32.560 --> 21:34.730
Don't set for me anymore today!

21:34.730 --> 21:37.570
<i>There it is. Bokuto's depressed mode.</i>

21:38.490 --> 21:39.070
What the...

21:41.700 --> 21:42.660
Okay.

21:42.660 --> 21:43.620
Huh?

21:43.620 --> 21:46.740
But in exchange, please calm down.

21:49.290 --> 21:50.910
Could this be our chance?

21:50.910 --> 21:53.080
Yeah, we can take this set!

21:53.420 --> 21:56.420
I don't know what's going on,
 but their ace doesn't seem to be doing well!

21:56.420 --> 21:57.630
Let's keep it up!

21:57.630 --> 21:58.920
Yeah!

21:59.260 --> 22:02.380
Hinata, we're gonna use that fast attack again.

22:03.300 --> 22:06.850
I'll give you the set you want, so have faith in me and jump.

22:06.850 --> 22:07.720
Okay!

22:08.810 --> 22:11.060
<i>We're going to take our new weapons</i>

22:11.850 --> 22:13.650
<i>and defeat Fukurodani!</i>

22:16.020 --> 22:16.020
{ED}

22:28.990 --> 22:34.540
We climb the mountain in our way

22:35.080 --> 22:41.130
Losing more than just time in the process

22:41.130 --> 22:47.140
Tasting freedom makes us want to fly

22:47.260 --> 22:53.180
And notice the feelings welling up inside

22:53.480 --> 22:56.610
It's almost in our reach

22:56.610 --> 22:59.690
The closer we get, the more it shines

22:59.690 --> 23:02.490
And stretches out in front of our eyes

23:02.490 --> 23:05.860
That panorama created just for us

23:05.860 --> 23:12.120
Until I reach the top and come back down, my lungs will keep breathing

23:12.120 --> 23:18.380
But now I've been possessed by the desire to climb that summit once again

23:18.380 --> 23:24.220
We cast aside all our doubt and set flight to the skies

23:24.220 --> 23:31.390
Our flailing hands reach out and grab hold of the moment

23:32.770 --> 23:34.390
That special moment

23:35.850 --> 23:40.360
Come to us climbers

23:40.940 --> 23:43.110
Come to us right now

23:46.070 --> 23:46.070
{Preview}

23:46.820 --> 23:49.070
<i>It looks like we can finally win against Fukurodani!</i>

23:49.070 --> 23:51.870
<i>Their ace was saying stuff like, "Don't set for me anymore!"</i>

23:51.870 --> 23:54.080
<i>Do you think the winner gets to eat more meat?</i>

23:54.080 --> 23:56.540
<i>Wait, won't that mean we get to eat less if we lose?!</i>

23:56.540 --> 23:58.080
<i>We're absolutely gonna win this!</i>

23:57.040 --> 24:01.090
