00:01.920 --> 00:02.940
Gather 'round!

00:03.310 --> 00:05.600
We face off against Nekoma first today.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.400
How did we do yesterday?

00:08.390 --> 00:11.550
This will be our third set overall with Nekoma.

00:11.550 --> 00:17.290
Yesterday, we played them twice, losing 25-17 and 25-19.

00:17.290 --> 00:20.730
Simply put, we haven't taken a single set off them yet.

00:20.730 --> 00:25.330
But if we calm down and go out there in full force, 
they should be opponents we can fight on equal footing.

00:25.990 --> 00:28.800
Hinata and Kageyama, this is your first time playing them in a while, isn't it?

00:29.250 --> 00:31.060
Go show 'em what you've got!

00:31.060 --> 00:32.260
Yes, sir!

00:40.680 --> 00:42.010
Okay, we're good to go.

00:43.430 --> 00:45.310
Give us a good serve, Fukunaga!

00:46.190 --> 00:50.110
I'll be the first to stop that fast attack of yours.

00:52.330 --> 00:53.720
Come on! Bring it!

00:55.030 --> 00:55.030
{OP}

01:04.080 --> 01:08.970
I keep running as I run out of breath

I feel like I'll be left behind in this world

01:18.800 --> 01:23.480
If I come to a standstill

01:23.940 --> 01:28.650
People ask me why I find joy in this

01:28.650 --> 01:33.230
But I don't understand it myself

01:33.700 --> 01:38.110
Running is the only thing on my mind

01:38.110 --> 01:42.290
Even if nothing goes right in the future

01:42.290 --> 01:47.920
I won't stop trying to find the best version of myself

01:47.920 --> 01:52.220
Even if someone tells me that this is as far as I go

01:52.220 --> 01:54.300
And draws the line on me

01:54.300 --> 01:58.240
I'll say no, thank you, and surge on ahead

01:58.890 --> 01:59.730
So what?

01:59.730 --> 02:01.350
Whatever the future may bring

02:01.350 --> 02:02.060
So what?

02:02.060 --> 02:03.850
However people are supposed to act

02:03.850 --> 02:04.590
So what?

02:04.590 --> 02:08.290
It doesn't really matter

02:10.270 --> 02:13.220
So I'm a believer

02:15.190 --> 02:21.000

02:25.500 --> 02:31.290
Episode Five: 
"Greed"

02:33.270 --> 02:36.960
I drank way too much with the 
teachers and coaches last night.

02:37.660 --> 02:39.510
What time is it?

02:40.650 --> 02:41.930
Nice receive!

02:45.230 --> 02:46.520
All right!

02:45.540 --> 02:47.350
Damn, that's amazing.

02:47.630 --> 02:48.760
Shake it off, Lev!

02:48.760 --> 02:49.750
You almost had it.

02:49.750 --> 02:50.310
Right!

02:50.310 --> 02:55.020
Karasuno's number ten really does close his eyes when he hits that fast attack.

02:51.210 --> 02:53.070
Give us another good serve, Tanaka!

02:55.020 --> 02:55.950
Yes.

02:55.950 --> 02:56.700
Cover me!

02:56.700 --> 03:01.990
The true nature of that superhuman fast attack is the amazingly sophisticated techniques of the setter.

02:57.570 --> 02:59.320
Center!

02:59.320 --> 03:00.460
Two blockers!

03:03.570 --> 03:04.910
Nice receive, Daichi!

03:07.120 --> 03:08.410
<i>He flew from A to C.</i>

03:16.250 --> 03:17.670
All right!

03:17.670 --> 03:20.640
H-He stopped it.

03:20.640 --> 03:23.080
And it didn't take him many tries either!

03:23.080 --> 03:27.130
Well, Nekoma's always been pretty good at reacting to that fast attack.

03:27.130 --> 03:32.390
On top of that, their new middle blocker is
 really tall and has an amazing reaction time.

03:33.100 --> 03:35.080
Give us a good one, Kenma!

03:40.700 --> 03:43.510
Hey, we're gonna do more of the normal fast attacks.

03:43.510 --> 03:44.790
The floaty ones.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.920
Hey, are you listening?

03:47.920 --> 03:48.890
Yeah.

03:51.450 --> 03:52.540
Lev.

03:55.390 --> 04:01.760
They're probably going to do a lot more normal fast attacks from here on, so please switch over to read blocking.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.980
What's that again?

04:03.980 --> 04:07.250
It's where you jump after seeing where the set goes.

04:07.250 --> 04:08.930
Oh, right! Got it!

04:09.610 --> 04:11.100
Give us a good one!

04:12.020 --> 04:12.710
Ryuu!

04:12.710 --> 04:13.480
Got it!

04:16.250 --> 04:18.480
<i>It's where you jump after seeing where the set goes.</i>

04:23.170 --> 04:24.910
That's one touch!

04:25.340 --> 04:27.570
I thought Hinata had successfully faked him out there!

04:27.570 --> 04:29.660
Even if he's one step behind, he can block really high!

04:29.660 --> 04:30.910
We can score here!

04:34.720 --> 04:35.790
<i>These guys...</i>

04:35.790 --> 04:38.000
All right!

04:36.200 --> 04:37.180
Damn it!

04:38.000 --> 04:40.760
Karasuno                  Nekoma

04:38.000 --> 04:40.760
Karasuno                  Nekoma

04:39.080 --> 04:40.760
Calm down, guys.

04:41.160 --> 04:44.310
They already had a careful eye on our fast attacks.

04:44.310 --> 04:48.780
For the time being, let's mainly have Azumane and Tanaka attacking from the left against Nekoma.

04:48.780 --> 04:49.720
Yes, sir.

04:48.780 --> 04:49.720
All right!

04:52.110 --> 04:53.900
We've only just begun!

04:52.580 --> 04:55.850
<i>Is that really enough for me to say? Or am I being too spineless?</i>

04:53.900 --> 04:54.540
Here.

04:54.540 --> 04:55.850
Thanks.

04:56.250 --> 04:57.350
Here, Tsukishima.

04:56.580 --> 04:58.270
Let's calm down and get that point.

04:57.350 --> 04:58.270
Oh, thanks.

04:58.560 --> 05:02.740
<i>Can you evolve by becoming more defensive, Keishin?</i>

05:02.740 --> 05:03.060
Here.

05:03.060 --> 05:04.040
Thanks.

05:04.910 --> 05:05.950
Here you go, Azumane.

05:07.340 --> 05:08.420
<i>Crap...</i>

05:09.280 --> 05:10.540
<i>What's going on with me?</i>

05:11.280 --> 05:13.880
<i>Nekoma, Lev...</i>

05:13.880 --> 05:16.660
<i>They're good. They're so good!</i>

05:18.420 --> 05:22.130
<i>I have to get better, or there's no way we'll win!</i>

05:25.120 --> 05:26.110
Cover it!

05:26.110 --> 05:27.550
Left!

05:27.550 --> 05:28.870
Two blockers!

05:28.870 --> 05:29.470
Got it!

05:30.970 --> 05:32.920
It's up! Nice, Kageyama!

05:32.920 --> 05:33.680
Nice save!

05:33.990 --> 05:35.920
Got it! Let's finish this off!

05:35.920 --> 05:37.100
Sorry! It's a bit short!

05:37.420 --> 05:38.150
Asahi!

05:38.150 --> 05:38.810
Spike it!

05:38.810 --> 05:39.760
Yeah!

05:41.160 --> 05:41.980
Huh?

05:56.980 --> 06:00.170
H-H-Ho-Ho-Hol-Hold—

06:00.830 --> 06:01.880
I'm sorry!

06:01.880 --> 06:03.830
I was only looking at the ball! I'm sorry!

06:03.830 --> 06:05.570
Are you okay? I'm sorry!

06:05.570 --> 06:07.550
I-I'm perfectly fine...

06:05.570 --> 06:11.740
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

06:07.960 --> 06:09.820
Hey, be careful.

06:09.820 --> 06:12.510
Shouyou's gonna be the one 
who goes flying in any collision.

06:12.930 --> 06:14.810
Make sure to look around you, idiot!

06:14.810 --> 06:17.000
Why do you think we all call things out, dumbass?!

06:17.000 --> 06:18.730
Right... I'm sorry.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.730
Moron! Hinata, you moron!

06:19.050 --> 06:20.810
Now, now. Calm down, Kageyama.

06:20.810 --> 06:23.190
<i>I'm sure Hinata acted completely on instinct there,</i>

06:23.190 --> 06:27.740
<i>but it looked like he was trying to steal the set from the ace.</i>

06:30.580 --> 06:33.620
<i>Is this time for the fledgling crow to evolve?</i>

06:34.070 --> 06:37.620
<i>And will that be a blessing or a curse for his team?</i>

06:38.010 --> 06:41.810
<i>No matter which, evolution will not 
come to those who don't seek change.</i>

06:42.750 --> 06:45.340
<i>If that is what you wish for,</i>

06:46.280 --> 06:52.350
<i>even if you are the star of the court, the hero, or the ace who brings forth victory,</i>

06:53.320 --> 06:58.000
<i>you need to greedily declare that </i>you<i> are at the top.</i>

06:59.920 --> 07:01.250
Hey, Kageyama.

07:01.250 --> 07:02.020
What?

07:03.500 --> 07:06.270
For the fast attack that goes whoosh,

07:09.490 --> 07:11.910
I'll stop closing my eyes.

07:11.910 --> 07:18.910

07:33.890 --> 07:34.900
What?

07:36.800 --> 07:38.310
What we're doing now isn't working.

07:38.960 --> 07:42.030
We need a fast attack where I decide how to hit the ball.

07:42.030 --> 07:45.480
You learned the normal fast attack because that was something you couldn't manage.

07:46.610 --> 07:51.600
I don't know what's going on with you right now, 
but if you have something to say, I'll listen to it later.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.710
However, if you're saying you're gonna do that right now,

07:54.710 --> 07:58.110
I won't set the ball to someone who I know will miss.

08:02.920 --> 08:04.590
Give us a good serve!

08:05.510 --> 08:06.460
Asahi!

08:07.300 --> 08:08.290
Sorry! Cover it!

08:08.290 --> 08:11.520
<i>I couldn't really understand that conversation, but...</i>

08:08.290 --> 08:09.560
Got it!

08:09.560 --> 08:10.630
Left!

08:11.520 --> 08:17.490
I wasn't imagining the tension between Hinata and Kageyama, right?

08:17.490 --> 08:18.350
You weren't.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.230
I touched it! We can score here!

08:21.760 --> 08:24.400
But it's not just those two.

08:24.400 --> 08:29.530
Ever since Hinata and Azumane bumped 
into each other, everyone's been on edge.

08:30.740 --> 08:32.360
Yes!

08:32.360 --> 08:35.070
Karasuno                  Nekoma

08:32.360 --> 08:35.070
Karasuno                  Nekoma

08:32.810 --> 08:34.690
All right!

08:34.690 --> 08:35.710
Let's go!

08:38.630 --> 08:40.410
<i>What we're doing now isn't working.</i>

08:40.740 --> 08:44.370
<i>Hinata just blurted out what we all had realized.</i>

08:47.800 --> 08:51.190
<i>Our collision was the result of a looming sense of dread.</i>

08:49.430 --> 08:51.190
All right! Here I go!

08:52.050 --> 08:56.300
<i>At this rate, Hinata and his growing greed...</i>

08:55.260 --> 08:56.300
I'll show you how it's done!

08:57.420 --> 08:58.510
<i>will eat me up.</i>

09:01.610 --> 09:05.260
It appears that your players have had a change in mindset.

09:07.370 --> 09:11.480
<i>It's true that hitting a wall is the perfect chance for 
them to grow, but how am I supposed to explain that?</i>

09:08.590 --> 09:09.510
Gather 'round!

09:11.960 --> 09:16.200
You guys are the weakest team here, right?

09:18.840 --> 09:20.910
<i>Well, he's not wrong...</i>

09:21.590 --> 09:26.720
If we played any of them in an official match right now, 
we'd be in a world of trouble.

09:26.720 --> 09:32.840
Do you see them as just an enemy, or do you see them as masters to absorb new techniques from?

09:33.330 --> 09:36.840
The fact that you're weak just means that there is potential for growth.

09:37.520 --> 09:39.430
What could be more fun than that?

09:41.180 --> 09:42.480
Thank you, sir!

09:42.480 --> 09:43.850
Sir!

09:44.540 --> 09:47.440
You really sounded like a teacher with that trustworthy speech!

09:47.440 --> 09:48.460
Thanks a lot!

09:48.460 --> 09:51.070
I mean, I <i>am</i> a teacher, so...

09:54.860 --> 09:56.990
It wouldn't hurt to at least try.

09:56.990 --> 10:02.450
I mean, he was able to do a normal fast attack on the fly the last time we faced Nekoma.

10:02.940 --> 10:07.170
At the time, there was a possibility the normal fast attack would work,

10:07.170 --> 10:09.960
and I thought that was the only chance we had.

10:11.960 --> 10:14.880
Before I knew it, we'd lost the final set against Seijou.

10:17.030 --> 10:22.300
By the time I noticed what was going on, the ball was on the floor behind me.

10:24.800 --> 10:25.810
Sorry about that.

10:27.820 --> 10:30.300
He read me like a book.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.350
It was my fault we lost,

10:33.060 --> 10:35.280
so I hate the fact that you apologized to me.

10:37.350 --> 10:40.950
I want to fight for myself in mid-air, right to the very end!

10:46.220 --> 10:52.630
From our match against Seijou, I started to understand how a setter draws out 100% of the spikers' potential.

10:53.880 --> 10:56.840
That fast attack is your best weapon.

10:57.420 --> 11:03.060
Any slight lapse in that fast attack becomes a fatal mistake.

11:04.390 --> 11:07.560
How you want to hit it doesn't matter.

11:13.640 --> 11:16.600
<i>Kageyama didn't dismiss him with an emotional outburst.</i>

11:16.600 --> 11:18.740
<i>He merely stated facts.</i>

11:19.510 --> 11:20.870
Sorry, Hinata.

11:20.870 --> 11:26.660
I think Kageyama is right this time.

11:27.790 --> 11:29.940
That fast attack is amazing enough already.

11:29.940 --> 11:33.990
Perfecting our other attacks with that at the core is probably what's best for us.

11:35.700 --> 11:38.680
Yeah, I agree with Sugawara.

11:38.680 --> 11:39.380
Mr. Ukai.

11:40.410 --> 11:44.970
You say you want to fight on your own, but that deviant fast attack depends on a split-second decision.

11:45.730 --> 11:51.450
I honestly think it's pretty hard trying to figure out what to do in that split second mid-air.

11:52.220 --> 11:58.320
But when I'm doing well, I can see it in 
slow motion, just like what Tanaka said.

11:58.930 --> 12:03.990
There are times I can see the opponents' block real clear in mid-air, like in slow motion.

12:04.310 --> 12:07.240
Almost like light is shining through it.

12:08.950 --> 12:12.800
Well, there are times where you can more easily see the blocks.

12:13.740 --> 12:15.920
In the practice match against Seijou...

12:16.870 --> 12:17.920
That last point...

12:18.720 --> 12:19.710
The Great King...

12:20.420 --> 12:22.130
I could see Oikawa's face.

12:22.850 --> 12:23.880
I could see his eyes.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.140
<i>Face? Eyes?</i>

12:26.140 --> 12:29.130
Oh, I get it. You <i>felt</i> like you could.

12:29.130 --> 12:32.060
The first time I nailed that fast attack in the three-on-three,

12:32.730 --> 12:34.400
I could see the other side.

12:35.050 --> 12:37.360
I could see the view from the peak.

12:37.900 --> 12:41.170
So you mean you <i>felt</i> like that's what you saw, right—

12:49.900 --> 12:52.000
Oh, there you are. We're starting.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.070
Oh, I'll be right there.

12:55.960 --> 12:58.420
Fukurodani               Karasuno

12:55.960 --> 12:58.420
Fukurodani               Karasuno

12:57.900 --> 12:58.420
Narita.

12:58.900 --> 12:59.670
Yes?

12:59.670 --> 13:01.470
Switch with Hinata for the next match.

13:01.470 --> 13:02.630
Huh? Uh, yes, sir!

13:05.110 --> 13:10.280
Despite what you think you want to accomplish, you need to chill out today.

13:10.280 --> 13:14.090
I don't think that trying anything out 
in the current conditions will succeed,

13:14.090 --> 13:17.770
and I can't risk anyone getting hurt 
with collisions during play like earlier.

13:23.710 --> 13:25.440
All right!

13:25.440 --> 13:26.320
Let's score!

13:25.440 --> 13:26.700
Don't sweat it!

13:26.320 --> 13:27.310
Get the next one!

13:26.700 --> 13:28.370
Bring it!

13:27.310 --> 13:28.370
One more on the dot!

13:31.170 --> 13:33.020
All right!

13:33.020 --> 13:33.740
Shrug it off!

13:33.740 --> 13:35.310
Nice spike, Lev!

13:35.310 --> 13:36.090
I got it!

13:36.090 --> 13:37.590
Cover! Cover!

13:37.590 --> 13:38.290
Give us a good serve!

13:38.710 --> 13:40.900
Give us another good serve!

13:42.500 --> 13:44.000
Thank you for the matches!

13:44.000 --> 13:45.220
Thank you!

13:45.860 --> 13:47.580
We'll see you the week after next,

13:47.580 --> 13:49.640
at the training camp during summer vacation.

13:49.640 --> 13:51.430
Yes, sir! We look forward to the opportunity!

13:52.130 --> 13:53.890
That's where it really begins.

13:55.020 --> 13:59.280
It's the last and most important long-term training camp before the spring tournament preliminaries.

13:59.280 --> 14:00.110
Yes.

14:00.790 --> 14:04.360
Just know that you're going to be joining me for drinks every night for a week.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.570
Yes, sir!

14:06.350 --> 14:07.490
Thank you very much.

14:06.670 --> 14:08.530
I'm mentioning this a bit late,

14:07.490 --> 14:08.530
It was my pleasure.

14:08.870 --> 14:11.590
but looks like all your third-years stuck around too.

14:09.580 --> 14:12.640
I'll start packing the gear into the back, so keep it coming!

14:11.590 --> 14:12.640
Yeah.

14:12.640 --> 14:17.000
You guys ended up going against last year's winners on the second day of the interhigh prelims, right?

14:12.640 --> 14:14.130
Right!

14:17.510 --> 14:18.540
I heard that from Hinata.

14:18.540 --> 14:19.520
Yeah.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.290
We stopped at the quarterfinals.

14:21.290 --> 14:23.980
Tokyo's quarterfinals are amazing.

14:23.980 --> 14:26.220
There's no point if we don't win it all.

14:26.740 --> 14:27.670
You're right.

14:29.450 --> 14:30.640
See you next time, Hinata.

14:31.150 --> 14:32.670
I'll stop you then too.

14:32.670 --> 14:33.970
I'm not gonna lose!

14:33.970 --> 14:37.470
I may only be 163 cm tall, but I'll kick your 194-cm ass!

14:54.740 --> 14:57.830
This training camp was really productive.

14:58.280 --> 15:00.970
I think we found a lot of areas for improvement.

15:00.970 --> 15:05.940
Well, we're gonna have to take them on one at a time.

15:05.940 --> 15:07.060
Indeed.

15:07.060 --> 15:09.820
Let's go home and carefully think about them.

15:09.820 --> 15:11.610
Go home, huh...

15:11.610 --> 15:12.300
Ukai?

15:12.950 --> 15:16.830
You just reminded me that a rather annoying relative is coming home.

15:20.340 --> 15:22.980
All right, everyone. Good work!

15:23.300 --> 15:24.480
Thank you, sir!

15:24.480 --> 15:30.950
So, as I mentioned, there will be inspections in the gym tomorrow, so we don't have practice.

15:31.410 --> 15:35.510
You've all gone a long time without a day off, so please enjoy it.

15:38.240 --> 15:38.950
Kageyama.

15:40.960 --> 15:43.130
Set for me.

15:48.310 --> 15:48.760
Huh?

15:49.180 --> 15:51.060
You two aren't going home yet?

15:51.060 --> 15:54.470
Yachi, if you don't mind, could you throw us some balls?

15:54.470 --> 15:56.380
Huh?! Can I do that?

15:56.380 --> 15:59.400
You just have to throw the ball above Kageyama's head.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.730
S-Sure! I'll give it a try.

16:04.710 --> 16:05.900
Let's do this!

16:06.700 --> 16:07.150
Here.

16:16.580 --> 16:20.040
<i>He gets distracted by the ball and can't jump his highest.</i>

16:20.770 --> 16:21.810
One more time!

16:46.380 --> 16:47.560
One more time!

16:50.510 --> 16:53.840
Instead of practicing an attack
 we're not sure you can even do,

16:53.840 --> 16:59.080
you should be working as much as you can on the attacks we've been using, as well as serving and blocking!

16:59.880 --> 17:01.010
But...

17:02.630 --> 17:06.720
if this fast attack doesn't work, 
there's no point in me being on the court!

17:06.720 --> 17:10.810
And I told you, how you want to hit 
it doesn't matter for that fast attack!

17:10.810 --> 17:13.060
I'll give you sets that won't be stopped by blocks!

17:13.060 --> 17:16.340
But then I'll never get better!

17:17.670 --> 17:20.270
The prelims for the spring tournament start next month!

17:20.270 --> 17:21.510
They're right around the corner.

17:21.510 --> 17:22.850
What do you think'll work for us?

17:23.260 --> 17:26.740
A perfected fast attack or an absolutely useless one?!

17:26.740 --> 17:27.690
Well?!

17:27.690 --> 17:29.400
P-Please don't fight, guys.

17:29.680 --> 17:31.660
<i>Damn it!</i>

17:30.110 --> 17:31.660
Calm down, Kageyama.

17:31.660 --> 17:35.110
<i>What I'm saying is true, so why...</i>

17:31.660 --> 17:33.230
You too, Hinata...

17:36.170 --> 17:38.030
<i>Why won't he give up?!</i>

17:39.340 --> 17:42.780
I want to be able to fight for myself!

17:43.850 --> 17:47.800
Your selfishness is going to destroy the team's balance!

17:49.240 --> 17:50.420
L-Let's all...

17:51.970 --> 17:55.270
Let's all be friends, o-okay?!

17:55.270 --> 17:59.640
I'll set for anyone I deem essential to winning.

18:00.860 --> 18:05.100
But right now, I don't think you are.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.550
My feelings on the matter haven't changed.

18:11.440 --> 18:15.490
Kageyama!

18:17.160 --> 18:19.180
Damn it! Let go!

18:19.180 --> 18:21.580
I won't let go until you set for me!

18:23.600 --> 18:24.680
Do it!

18:25.610 --> 18:27.680
Someone... Help!

18:27.680 --> 18:28.590
Get the hell off me!

18:28.590 --> 18:30.830
They blocked that fast attack!

18:30.830 --> 18:33.240
Today, and when we played Seijou!

18:33.240 --> 18:36.300
Are you blaming my sets for that?!

18:36.300 --> 18:38.380
No, I'm not!

18:38.380 --> 18:40.820
They were perfect! Spot-on!

18:40.820 --> 18:42.260
But they still got blocked!

18:42.260 --> 18:45.770
If I don't improve, it's not going to work on better opponents either!

18:46.350 --> 18:47.430
Hey!

18:47.970 --> 18:50.840
Cut this shit out, you two!

19:01.850 --> 19:05.370
I-I'm just going to the bus stop over there, so here is fine.

19:06.270 --> 19:07.040
Thanks.

19:07.660 --> 19:09.050
I'm sorry, Yachi.

19:09.050 --> 19:10.500
N-No, it's nothing!

19:12.140 --> 19:15.010
It's fine... I'm totally fine.

19:15.660 --> 19:17.830
<i>But you're...</i>

19:19.470 --> 19:23.050
In my first and last tournament in junior high,

19:23.360 --> 19:25.140
we were destroyed by Kageyama.

19:25.850 --> 19:29.020
I vowed to get revenge, and when I got to high school, there he was.

19:29.430 --> 19:32.630
He was even worse than I could've imagined, and we went through a lot,

19:33.250 --> 19:37.080
but once we started playing some matches, I felt like we understood each other.

19:40.120 --> 19:42.300
It wasn't like I'd finally made a friend.

19:42.300 --> 19:44.070
We were partners.

19:48.740 --> 19:50.000
Well, see ya.

19:50.000 --> 19:50.910
Yeah...

20:06.920 --> 20:08.050
What?

20:08.050 --> 20:10.060
They got into a fight?

20:10.830 --> 20:14.450
There's been tension between them ever since the training camp.

20:14.450 --> 20:18.280
I wonder if they're gonna be okay, 
considering the prelims are coming up soon.

20:18.280 --> 20:22.880
This isn't their first fight, though, right?

20:23.900 --> 20:28.100
Come to think of it, they were fighting even before they turned in their applications.

20:28.100 --> 20:29.040
What? Seriously?

20:29.540 --> 20:32.690
The first day, they knocked off the Vice Principal's toupée,

20:32.690 --> 20:34.960
and they even got shut out of the gym by Daichi.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.040
It sure was something.

20:36.480 --> 20:41.220
Well, that also means they've worked past all that stuff.

20:41.220 --> 20:42.510
Right? That's why...

20:43.110 --> 20:45.710
I think we should just believe in them and wait.

20:46.390 --> 20:48.850
<b>Foot of the Slope</b>

20:47.930 --> 20:48.850
Thanks for shopping.

20:55.340 --> 20:58.060
<i>Considering he didn't look when attacking before,</i>

20:58.060 --> 21:01.740
<i>asking him to start to get better is pretty pointless.</i>

21:02.410 --> 21:04.060
I could see the other side.

21:04.730 --> 21:07.080
I could see the view from the peak.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.740
<i>Those eyes of his...</i>

21:09.260 --> 21:13.460
<i>How long you're at the highest point of a jump is literally only a second.</i>

21:14.150 --> 21:18.420
<i>Even if you're able to see the block,
 it shouldn't be anything more than a blur.</i>

21:18.970 --> 21:23.900
<i>But I've heard that every once in a while there are moments where spikers can clearly see the blockers' fingers,</i>

21:23.900 --> 21:26.930
<i>or even what's behind them.</i>

21:28.010 --> 21:29.760
<i>Can Hinata actually see that?</i>

21:33.580 --> 21:36.890
<i>A fast attack that comes from a superhuman set...</i>

21:37.960 --> 21:42.620
<i>If Hinata could decide where he 
wants to hit that while in mid-air...</i>

21:44.900 --> 21:47.220
<i>Nah, there's no way that's possible.</i>

21:47.220 --> 21:48.870
<i>It's pointless to even think about.</i>

21:49.730 --> 21:50.780
<i>But maybe...</i>

21:52.870 --> 21:54.250
<i>If he could actually do it,</i>

21:55.150 --> 21:58.350
<i>that duo would even surpass</i>

21:59.330 --> 22:01.290
<i>the Little Giant in mid-air combat.</i>

22:05.990 --> 22:07.280
Welcome—

22:07.280 --> 22:09.530
Oh, it's you, Hinata.

22:10.620 --> 22:14.380
Coach, how exactly do I need to practice to improve?

22:14.930 --> 22:14.930
{ED}

22:27.900 --> 22:33.470
We climb the mountain in our way

22:33.990 --> 22:40.040
Losing more than just time in the process

22:40.040 --> 22:46.050
Tasting freedom makes us want to fly

22:46.170 --> 22:52.110
And notice the feelings welling up inside

22:52.390 --> 22:55.520
It's almost in our reach

22:55.520 --> 22:58.600
The closer we get, the more it shines

22:58.600 --> 23:01.390
And stretches out in front of our eyes

23:01.390 --> 23:04.760
That panorama created just for us

23:04.760 --> 23:11.030
Until I reach the top and come back down, my lungs will keep breathing

23:11.030 --> 23:17.290
But now I've been possessed by the desire to climb that summit once again

23:17.290 --> 23:23.140
We cast aside all our doubt and set flight to the skies

23:23.140 --> 23:30.300
Our flailing hands reach out and grab hold of the moment

23:31.660 --> 23:33.300
That special moment

23:34.770 --> 23:39.280
Come to us climbers

23:39.830 --> 23:42.020
Come to us right now

23:45.020 --> 23:45.020
{Preview}

23:45.750 --> 23:47.900
<i>Hinata and Kageyama are fighting, huh?</i>

23:47.900 --> 23:49.420
<i>You can really smell the teen spirit.</i>

23:49.420 --> 23:51.820
<i>I can't say the same for you, Asahi.</i>

23:51.820 --> 23:53.360
<i>Huh? Then what do I smell like?</i>
