00:05.070 --> 00:06.950
Oh man!

00:06.950 --> 00:09.610
Setting off in the middle of the night is pretty exciting!

00:09.610 --> 00:12.370
Oh, right. You guys were late last time.

00:12.370 --> 00:14.490
Being an idiot must be nice.

00:14.490 --> 00:15.790
You can fall asleep anywhere.

00:15.790 --> 00:16.750
What'd you say?!

00:17.290 --> 00:21.130
Anyway, we plan on getting there around dawn again.

00:21.580 --> 00:25.210
Ukai and I will take turns driving.

00:25.210 --> 00:26.590
Sorry if I nod off.

00:26.590 --> 00:27.380
We're counting on you, sir!

00:27.380 --> 00:28.590
Sir!

00:28.970 --> 00:30.840
It's the middle of the night, so not so loud.

00:30.840 --> 00:32.800
Oh, sorry. It's a habit.

00:33.220 --> 00:35.010
Do you guys have everything?

00:35.010 --> 00:37.520
Make sure you double-check.

00:35.520 --> 00:40.190
<i>Hinata and Kageyama haven't really talked to each other lately. I wonder if they'll be okay.</i>

00:38.730 --> 00:40.190
I wonder if I can.

00:40.730 --> 00:41.980
All right, Ryuu!

00:41.730 --> 00:44.730
All right, we're heading out.

00:41.980 --> 00:43.770
Let's show 'em what we're made of!

00:43.770 --> 00:45.530
Hell yeah, Noya! Let's do this!

00:44.730 --> 00:47.030
Just shut up and get on the damn bus.

00:47.030 --> 00:47.030
{OP}

00:56.080 --> 01:00.960
I keep running as I run out of breath

01:00.960 --> 01:05.880
With dreams on my mind and a fire in my belly

01:01.000 --> 01:05.880

01:05.880 --> 01:10.800
I feel like I'll be left behind in this world

01:10.800 --> 01:15.470
If I come to a standstill

01:15.930 --> 01:20.640
People ask me why I find joy in this

01:20.640 --> 01:25.230
But I don't understand it myself

01:25.690 --> 01:30.110
Running is the only thing on my mind

01:30.110 --> 01:34.280
Even if nothing goes right in the future

01:34.280 --> 01:39.910
I won't stop trying to find the best version of myself

01:39.910 --> 01:44.210
Even if someone tells me that this is as far as I go

01:44.210 --> 01:46.290
And draws the line on me

01:46.290 --> 01:50.210
I'll say no, thank you, and surge on ahead

01:50.880 --> 01:51.720
So what?

01:51.720 --> 01:53.340
Whatever the future may bring

01:53.340 --> 01:54.050
So what?

01:54.050 --> 01:55.850
However people are supposed to act

01:55.850 --> 01:56.600
So what?

01:56.600 --> 02:00.270
It doesn't really matter

02:02.270 --> 02:05.230
So I'm a believer

02:07.190 --> 02:12.990
So I'm a believer

02:16.990 --> 02:16.990
{Part A}

02:17.700 --> 02:20.330
Hey, hey! Where's the Skytree?

02:17.990 --> 02:21.950
Episode Seven: 
Moonrise

02:17.990 --> 02:21.950
Episode Seven: 
Moonrise

02:20.330 --> 02:21.950
Huh? The Skytree?

02:21.950 --> 02:24.750
Oh! Is that Tokyo Tower?!

02:24.750 --> 02:25.670
Huh?

02:25.670 --> 02:29.380
That's just a normal transmission tower.

02:29.380 --> 02:32.880
What the hell? Are there no transmission towers in Miyagi?

02:32.880 --> 02:34.880
Actually, I'm getting some déjà vu here.

02:34.880 --> 02:39.680
To those out in the countryside, 
all steel towers in Tokyo look like Tokyo Tower!

02:39.680 --> 02:41.220
That's a bit insulting.

02:41.220 --> 02:43.520
Also, we're in Saitama.

02:43.520 --> 02:46.440
<i>So that's </i>not<i> Tokyo Tower?</i>

02:47.110 --> 02:49.690
We're playing at a different school than last time, huh?

02:49.690 --> 02:52.690
Apparently, all the summer training camps are held at Shinzen.

02:52.690 --> 02:54.400
It's nice and cool here.

02:55.610 --> 02:57.320
There are tons of bugs, though.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.740
Hinata!

02:59.030 --> 03:00.740
Have you grown any taller?!

03:00.740 --> 03:01.950
Shut up, Lev.

03:01.950 --> 03:04.790
<i>That's</i> how you greet me?

03:04.790 --> 03:06.830
Also, no one grows in just two weeks!

03:06.830 --> 03:08.790
I grew two millimeters.

03:11.670 --> 03:12.550
All right.

03:12.550 --> 03:15.880
We're gonna switch out people constantly this time around, so be prepared.

03:15.880 --> 03:17.010
Yes, sir!

03:17.010 --> 03:19.220
Karasuno               Fukurodani

03:17.010 --> 03:19.220
Karasuno               Fukurodani

03:19.510 --> 03:21.930
Our goal is zero penalties!

03:28.440 --> 03:29.560
Noya!

03:29.560 --> 03:30.360
Yeah!

03:30.360 --> 03:31.690
Nice receive!

03:31.690 --> 03:33.070
<i>A chance for a fast attack!</i>

03:34.530 --> 03:36.610
That weird fast attack is incoming!

03:36.610 --> 03:38.820
Leave it there, leave it there,

03:39.200 --> 03:40.910
leave it there!

03:46.960 --> 03:49.130
<i>It was too short!</i>

03:51.380 --> 03:54.300
What the heck? That wasn't like you at all.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.470
I'm sorry.

03:56.130 --> 03:57.220
<i>Damn it.</i>

03:57.220 --> 03:59.140
<i>It feels different when I'm in an actual match.</i>

04:01.100 --> 04:03.470
All right, give us another good serve!

04:01.760 --> 04:03.470
<i>Surprised?</i>

04:03.470 --> 04:05.020
<i>I'm sure you've realized it.</i>

04:05.770 --> 04:08.730
<i>Kageyama's set is completely different now.</i>

04:10.520 --> 04:11.360
Got it!

04:15.570 --> 04:17.110
<i>This time, it went too far.</i>

04:21.280 --> 04:22.240
<i>His left hand?!</i>

04:22.240 --> 04:24.160
<i>He immediately tried to save it with his left hand!</i>

04:28.370 --> 04:29.710
Nice, Hinata!

04:29.710 --> 04:33.170
He used to fret so much when the timing was off!

04:33.170 --> 04:34.880
Nice, Shouyou!

04:34.880 --> 04:37.630
<i>The set dropped again.</i>

04:39.380 --> 04:40.590
<i>He's...</i>

04:41.050 --> 04:42.800
<i>...different than before.</i>

04:44.060 --> 04:45.140
Don't let it get to you!

04:45.140 --> 04:46.560
We couldn't do much about that one!

04:46.560 --> 04:48.310
We'll get the next one!

04:50.100 --> 04:52.100
<i>Hinata and Kageyama</i>

04:52.100 --> 04:55.070
Fukurodani                                 Karasuno

04:52.100 --> 04:55.070
Fukurodani                                 Karasuno

04:52.650 --> 04:55.070
<i>aren't the only ones who've changed.</i>

05:03.370 --> 05:04.910
It's out!

05:07.290 --> 05:10.710
<i>Azumane looks so intense when he clicks his tongue like that.</i>

05:10.710 --> 05:12.580
That's fine! Keep it up!

05:18.300 --> 05:20.340
Indeed, this is truly delightful!

05:20.340 --> 05:22.090
This is ever so delightfully...

05:25.850 --> 05:27.890
not in sync at all.

05:28.520 --> 05:33.480
Did Karasuno just try to do a synchronized attack?

05:28.810 --> 05:29.980
Sorry!

05:35.060 --> 05:35.860
Sorry! Cover it!

05:35.860 --> 05:36.900
Leave it to me!

05:39.110 --> 05:41.950
Jumping off from the back zone?
 Is the libero doing a jumping set?

05:47.030 --> 05:48.370
<i>I jumped too far!</i>

05:48.740 --> 05:50.710
Hey, what's up with you guys today?

05:50.710 --> 05:51.710
Are you all right?

05:51.710 --> 05:53.330
Dammit!

05:53.330 --> 05:56.090
Karasuno               Fukurodani

05:53.330 --> 05:56.090
Karasuno               Fukurodani

05:54.040 --> 05:56.090
I wonder what happened to Karasuno.

05:56.090 --> 05:58.050
Maybe they're in some kind of rut.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.010
I'd say it's the opposite.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.970
Because they're crows, they're omnivorous.

06:05.470 --> 06:07.930
Whether it be deep in the mountains

06:07.930 --> 06:10.810
or in the middle of Kabukicho,

06:10.810 --> 06:13.810
they eat anything edible

06:13.810 --> 06:17.520
and take advantage of those stronger than them to survive.

06:17.940 --> 06:23.530
It looks like they're in the middle 
of evolving at an incredible speed.

06:18.270 --> 06:19.730
Nice receive!

06:19.730 --> 06:21.110
Left! Left!

06:21.110 --> 06:22.110
Bokuto!

06:26.820 --> 06:28.410
Yes!

06:29.450 --> 06:32.660
<i>Though it seems there might be one exception.</i>

06:34.120 --> 06:36.540
Karasuno               Fukurodani

06:34.120 --> 06:36.540
Karasuno               Fukurodani

06:34.960 --> 06:36.540
Thank you!

06:39.460 --> 06:43.800
The penalty for this camp is apparently something you only see at Shinzen.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.970
A refreshing sprint up the hill 
behind the school to the forest!

06:48.850 --> 06:49.850
All right.

06:49.850 --> 06:50.770
Ready...

06:50.770 --> 06:51.680
Go!

07:03.860 --> 07:04.900
Here.

07:05.700 --> 07:06.820
Thanks.

07:06.820 --> 07:08.120
Sugawara, here.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.030
Give us a good serve!

07:09.660 --> 07:12.200
Shinzen and Ubugawa are still playing their first set?

07:12.200 --> 07:12.660
Yeah.

07:15.870 --> 07:18.580
Whoa! That serve is really something!

07:19.090 --> 07:20.040
Left!

07:22.050 --> 07:24.130
Whoa, he got totally shut out!

07:24.130 --> 07:26.130
Serve and block.

07:26.130 --> 07:31.220
Break up the opponent with the serve, figure out where they're going to attack, and then take 'em out with a block.

07:31.220 --> 07:34.600
That's the most ideal way to score, second only to a service ace.

07:35.770 --> 07:37.980
Serve and block...

07:37.980 --> 07:39.810
Damn you and your pouty lips.

07:39.810 --> 07:41.190
Broccoli...

07:41.190 --> 07:43.690
Quit it. You're being disrespectful to food.

07:43.690 --> 07:45.190
What?!

07:48.450 --> 07:50.070
We were utterly destroyed.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.490
It's actually sort of refreshing.

07:52.490 --> 07:56.910
I haven't done that many sprints since Coach Ukai was around.

07:58.210 --> 08:02.960
Let's go borrow Mr. Ukai's tablet and
 review videos of synchronized attacks.

08:02.960 --> 08:03.460
All right.

08:03.460 --> 08:04.260
Sure thing.

08:04.260 --> 08:05.460
I'm gonna go practice serving.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.090
I still need a lot of work.

08:07.090 --> 08:09.180
<i>Serving! I'll practice some too.</i>

08:10.010 --> 08:11.470
Oh, Tsukki!

08:11.470 --> 08:13.510
I'm gonna go hit some serves. Want to—

08:13.510 --> 08:15.430
I'm gonna go take a bath and go to bed.

08:15.430 --> 08:17.270
I see.

08:17.270 --> 08:18.560
Um...

08:18.560 --> 08:19.270
What?

08:19.900 --> 08:23.690
I was just wondering if you were gonna practice anything on your own...

08:23.690 --> 08:26.070
We practice more than enough already.

08:27.740 --> 08:30.200
Practicing as hard as you can isn't always a good idea, you know.

08:30.870 --> 08:32.990
R-Right...

08:34.200 --> 08:36.700
You're right, but...

08:42.670 --> 08:45.170
Hey, dude from Karasuno! Wait up!

08:45.170 --> 08:46.590
You with the glasses!

08:47.420 --> 08:49.300
Can you block some balls for us?

08:53.720 --> 08:55.810
Oh, actually, I'm done for the night.

08:55.810 --> 08:57.020
If you'll excuse me.

08:57.020 --> 08:57.680
What?!

08:58.100 --> 09:01.520
It's meaningless to practice spiking without blockers.

09:01.520 --> 09:03.400
I'm begging you!

09:03.400 --> 09:05.230
Why does it have to be me?

09:05.230 --> 09:06.610
Why not someone from Fukurodani?

09:06.900 --> 09:11.860
Bokuto's spike practice is endless, 
so they all hurry up and leave to escape from it.

09:11.860 --> 09:15.450
And I'm busy training this guy over here.

09:15.450 --> 09:19.330
I'll block for him! C'mon!

09:19.330 --> 09:20.210
Shut up!

09:20.540 --> 09:25.000
If you want to stay on the roster, 
you need to actually be able to receive the ball!

09:26.750 --> 09:28.170
He may not look it,

09:28.760 --> 09:34.050
but this guy's one of the top five spikers in the country, so I think he'd be good practice for you.

09:35.100 --> 09:38.560
So he somehow didn't make it into the top three, huh?

09:38.560 --> 09:39.310
Shake it off, buddy.

09:39.310 --> 09:41.560
Don't build me up just to knock me down!

09:42.060 --> 09:48.280
Besides, couldn't you use a bit more practice blocking, seeing as you're a middle blocker and all?

10:03.870 --> 10:05.210
<i>We need to practice.</i>

10:06.210 --> 10:10.300
<i>If we don't manage to make this somewhat useful by next month, we'll be in trouble.</i>

10:11.670 --> 10:13.800
Oh, do you guys want to practice your fast attack?

10:14.180 --> 10:16.600
Balls? Want some balls?

10:16.600 --> 10:20.060
<i>Why is she making it sound like she's offering us a drink?</i>

10:20.520 --> 10:22.640
I-If you'd please!

10:22.640 --> 10:23.730
Please.

One more!

10:49.170 --> 10:50.420
One more!

10:52.970 --> 10:53.760
<i>A straight spike!</i>

10:53.760 --> 10:55.970
<i>He's so smart and calm!</i>

10:56.300 --> 10:57.220
<i>But...</i>

10:58.970 --> 10:59.930
Yes!

10:59.930 --> 11:02.140
You know you just beat a single blocker, right?

11:02.140 --> 11:03.390
Stop raining on my parade!

11:04.560 --> 11:06.940
Well, how about two, then?

11:06.940 --> 11:09.020
Bring it on!

11:09.020 --> 11:10.150
<i>Is he dead?</i>

11:10.150 --> 11:11.730
Here we go!

11:13.650 --> 11:16.410
Four-eyes, make sure you to watch for that straight spike!

11:24.370 --> 11:25.210
Yay!

11:25.210 --> 11:26.960
Dammit!

11:28.540 --> 11:32.920
Specky, you're good at anticipating my moves,

11:32.920 --> 11:35.260
but your blocks are pretty weak.

11:35.800 --> 11:38.550
I get worried that I might break your arm in two or something.

11:38.550 --> 11:40.470
You gotta rush in and stop the ball. Rush in!

11:40.800 --> 11:43.930
I'm still a growing boy!

11:43.930 --> 11:47.140
I have a ways to go in both strength and height.

11:48.100 --> 11:53.690
If you take it too easy, Shorty will steal the spotlight.

11:53.690 --> 11:55.150
You play the same position, right?

11:56.950 --> 11:57.860
Huh?

11:58.160 --> 12:01.080
I don't think I can do anything about that.

12:01.080 --> 12:05.080
He's clearly far more talented than I am.

12:07.160 --> 12:07.540
Oh!

12:07.960 --> 12:09.630
Are you practicing spikes again?!

12:09.630 --> 12:11.710
Want me to block?! Do ya?!

12:11.710 --> 12:14.800
Hey, Lev! Stop rolling around on the ground! Practice receiving!

12:14.800 --> 12:15.760
Ugh! Yaku!

12:15.760 --> 12:16.630
Don't "ugh" me!

12:16.630 --> 12:19.260
Get up already. You had a long enough rest.

12:17.050 --> 12:19.760
Well, it looks like I'll be in the way, so if you'll excuse me.

12:19.260 --> 12:22.930
Yeah, I'm totally set to go for some blocking practice!

12:19.760 --> 12:20.930
Hey!

12:21.600 --> 12:24.970
Looks like you hit on a sensitive subject, Kuroo.

12:22.930 --> 12:24.970
Oh? Then let's see what you've got.

12:24.970 --> 12:26.600
You pissed him off.

12:26.890 --> 12:30.400
You're not living up to your reputation as a master of provocation, Kuroo.

12:30.400 --> 12:33.190
Who could've imagined that, though?

12:33.190 --> 12:33.940
Imagined what?

12:33.980 --> 12:42.780
{=0}<b>Unknown</b>

12:33.980 --> 12:42.780
{=0}<b>Unknown</b>

12:34.360 --> 12:38.780
Karasuno's Shorty is definitely strange and a threat,

12:38.780 --> 12:41.070
but in terms of technique and experience, he's like a baby bird.

12:41.070 --> 12:42.780
Plus he's really short.

12:43.240 --> 12:47.500
Four-eyes is that tall and has those brains, and yet...

12:47.500 --> 12:52.460
He looks at Shorty not as an equal but
 as someone that he's no match against.

12:54.210 --> 12:56.760
<i>Shit, I left my pads behind.</i>

12:57.630 --> 12:59.590

13:00.760 --> 13:02.050
One more! One more!

13:02.340 --> 13:04.760
Wasn't the timing a bit too early there?

13:04.760 --> 13:05.510
You think so?

13:06.180 --> 13:08.310
Then for the next one, I'll delay it by one tempo.

13:09.690 --> 13:10.770
Here we go!

13:13.810 --> 13:15.570
Sorry. One more.

13:15.020 --> 13:16.940
This is just a high school club.

13:15.570 --> 13:16.230
Right.

13:16.230 --> 13:16.940
Let's go!

13:18.110 --> 13:20.110
Why do you try so hard?

13:20.110 --> 13:21.490
Trying that hard...

13:25.620 --> 13:27.580
only makes it hurt more.

13:36.340 --> 13:38.050
<b>Cafeteria</b>

13:37.050 --> 13:38.050
Hey, Tsukishima.

13:38.760 --> 13:40.510
Eat up! Or you're not gonna last!

13:40.800 --> 13:43.510
Well, at least your <i>stomach</i> is big, Nishinoya.

13:43.510 --> 13:44.470
What was that?!

13:44.800 --> 13:47.680
You cheeky brat! Your true self will pay!

13:44.800 --> 13:45.510
Here.

13:45.510 --> 13:47.680
Th-Thank you!

13:47.680 --> 13:50.640
Hey! Stop!

13:49.890 --> 13:53.020
Hey, Daichi's gonna get mad!

13:50.640 --> 13:52.020
You're gonna break them!

13:59.440 --> 14:00.860
Karasuno                  Nekoma

13:59.440 --> 14:00.860
Karasuno                  Nekoma

14:01.280 --> 14:01.740
Go!

14:06.030 --> 14:06.580
Go!

14:11.540 --> 14:12.080
Go!

14:19.550 --> 14:20.460
Here you go, Hinata.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.420
Thanks!

14:21.420 --> 14:22.840
Everyone!

14:23.260 --> 14:27.300
The parents from Shinzen High gave us some watermelons!

14:31.390 --> 14:33.690
Whoa! That's awesome, Lev!

14:37.560 --> 14:38.770
Can I get one more?

14:38.770 --> 14:39.480
Sure.

14:39.480 --> 14:40.280
Thanks.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.570
Huh? You only wanted one slice, Tsukishima?

14:43.570 --> 14:45.450
Yeah. Thanks for the food.

14:45.450 --> 14:48.660
I ate way too much once and got a stomachache.

14:48.660 --> 14:50.080
I have to apologize.

14:51.040 --> 14:51.870
For what?

14:51.870 --> 14:56.130
I think I might've pissed off Four-eyes a bit yesterday.

14:56.130 --> 14:56.880
What?

14:58.420 --> 15:02.840
Wow, I'm a bit surprised Tsukishima actually 
helped out with your practice, regardless of why.

14:59.630 --> 15:01.300
Hinata, you suck.

15:02.840 --> 15:04.840
So, what did you say to him?

15:04.840 --> 15:08.550
I provoked him, saying that he'd lose out to Shorty.

15:08.930 --> 15:13.270
Yeah, he does have a bit of an inferiority complex when it comes to Hinata...

15:13.270 --> 15:16.270
<i>Rocking the house is Hinata's job.</i>

15:16.270 --> 15:22.190
<i>My job is to hold down the fort as much as possible while he's in the back row.</i>

15:22.940 --> 15:24.700
<i>It's no different from the norm.</i>

15:26.030 --> 15:29.370
I'm not sure if this is relevant, 
but my sister told me something.

15:29.910 --> 15:31.120
By the way...

15:31.120 --> 15:32.080
Huh?

15:32.080 --> 15:35.080
A name I heard at the training camp caught my attention.

15:35.870 --> 15:38.630
Is there someone named Tsukishima on your team?

15:40.840 --> 15:42.590
Yeah.

15:42.590 --> 15:46.180
He wears glasses and is a pompous little brat.

15:46.180 --> 15:49.680
Do you know if he has an older brother?

15:49.680 --> 15:50.470
Huh?

15:50.470 --> 15:51.810
Like I'd know.

15:51.810 --> 15:53.890
He doesn't really talk about himself.

15:53.890 --> 15:56.520
When I went to Karasuno...

15:56.520 --> 15:59.480
When the boys' volleyball team 
was at their strongest, you know?

15:59.480 --> 16:01.730
You mean when the Little Giant went?

16:01.730 --> 16:07.820
Right. Back then, I think there was a tall guy named Tsukishima on the volleyball team.

16:08.110 --> 16:08.780
Huh?

16:08.780 --> 16:10.370
Tsukishima has an older brother?

16:10.370 --> 16:12.410
Oh, I'm not sure about that.

16:12.780 --> 16:16.210
Maybe it's just someone who happens to have the same last name.

16:16.210 --> 16:18.670
Hey, we're about to start!

16:18.670 --> 16:19.880
Okay, let's go.

16:19.880 --> 16:20.420
Yeah.

16:20.420 --> 16:21.790
Oh, sorry. One sec.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.340
Karasuno                  Nekoma

16:26.800 --> 16:28.340
Karasuno                  Nekoma

16:28.340 --> 16:29.300
Go!

16:33.930 --> 16:35.310
This is rough...

16:35.310 --> 16:38.230
I can still do at least ten more!

16:38.230 --> 16:39.730
How about we win instead?!

16:46.610 --> 16:50.660
Yamaguchi, your serves look a lot better compared to before.

16:50.660 --> 16:52.320
Th-Thank you very much.

16:52.910 --> 16:55.790
I have to improve my success rate.

16:56.080 --> 16:58.660
Doesn't it bother you, Azumane?

16:58.660 --> 16:59.500
Doesn't what?

17:00.370 --> 17:03.750
The feeling that someone with immense talent is creeping up behind you.

17:04.880 --> 17:08.050
Well, I definitely can't relax at all.

17:08.050 --> 17:12.590
I'm sure Hinata is still focused on becoming the ace.

17:12.590 --> 17:13.970
Probably so.

17:14.760 --> 17:18.390
Maybe that's why he said what we were doing wasn't working.

17:18.390 --> 17:21.690
But it seems like him saying that got all of us fired up too.

17:21.690 --> 17:26.650
If you're not careful, he might get too focused and end up biting you again.

17:28.610 --> 17:32.660
Oh, you mean when we collided when going for a spike.

17:33.660 --> 17:35.160
We're in the same boat.

17:35.160 --> 17:39.120
Our positions kind of make Hinata our rival,

17:39.120 --> 17:44.460
so we probably notice more than everyone else how much he's grown from the baby bird he used to be.

17:45.790 --> 17:48.760
I don't plan on losing to him, though.

17:52.510 --> 17:53.430
Left! Left!

17:55.850 --> 17:57.220
All right!

17:55.850 --> 17:57.890
Karasuno                         Ubugawa

17:55.850 --> 17:57.890
Karasuno                         Ubugawa

17:57.890 --> 18:01.140
Why'd you just give up?! 
Even if you're a decoy, you need to jump!

18:01.140 --> 18:02.690
Aren't you observant?

18:02.690 --> 18:03.850
Sorry, dude.

18:04.190 --> 18:05.690
Tsukishima, it's your serve next.

18:05.020 --> 18:07.400
What do you think of Tsukishima?

18:05.690 --> 18:06.690
Right.

18:08.440 --> 18:10.570
I think he's taking this seriously. Why do you ask?

18:10.570 --> 18:11.400
Give us a good one!

18:11.400 --> 18:14.700
I feel like Tsukishima is fine with just getting a passing grade.

18:14.700 --> 18:17.080
He never tries to get a perfect score.

18:17.410 --> 18:18.870
It's coming left! Left!

18:17.910 --> 18:20.660
I'm not asking for him to become more passionate,

18:18.870 --> 18:19.700
Cover it!

18:19.700 --> 18:20.660
Number four!

18:20.660 --> 18:24.540
but if he not going to give his all, 
I'm gonna have to switch up the starters.

18:23.120 --> 18:24.540
Nice receive!

18:24.830 --> 18:25.630
Center!

18:24.830 --> 18:25.630
Left!

18:25.630 --> 18:28.250
I need players who can win.

18:28.670 --> 18:31.210
He's valuable as the tallest member of the team.

18:30.130 --> 18:31.210
All right!

18:31.210 --> 18:36.850
If he could become the cornerstone of our blocking, our defense would improve considerably.

18:36.850 --> 18:38.220
I see.

18:38.220 --> 18:39.850
Cover it!

18:38.220 --> 18:40.430
Karasuno                 Ubugawa

18:38.220 --> 18:40.430
Karasuno                 Ubugawa

18:40.430 --> 18:41.390
Leave it to me!

18:40.430 --> 18:41.390
Got it!

18:43.560 --> 18:44.100
Sorry!

18:44.100 --> 18:44.810
My bad!

18:45.600 --> 18:48.020
Everyone's really giving it their all.

18:48.020 --> 18:51.820
They're all more motivated than they've ever been,

18:51.820 --> 18:53.990
but sometimes it can get a bit scary.

18:54.950 --> 18:59.120
Collisions like that one before could lead to huge injuries.

18:59.120 --> 19:00.700
It's coming on the left! Number one!

19:03.290 --> 19:05.710
I'm counting on you, Asahi!

19:06.210 --> 19:07.460
<i>It's a bit short.</i>

19:12.880 --> 19:14.340
<i>It's my ball!</i>

19:27.270 --> 19:29.310
<i>Better than expected.</i>

19:29.310 --> 19:35.780
<i>Whether you're on the same team or not,
 the tension you feel as rivals is essential for growth.</i>

19:31.480 --> 19:33.400
Nice spike, Asahi!

19:33.400 --> 19:34.990
That was awesome!

19:34.990 --> 19:35.780
Thanks.

19:35.780 --> 19:39.870
<i>However, if the team became lawless, everything would be for naught.</i>

19:40.660 --> 19:44.870
<i>Karasuno's ace managed to hold them together.</i>

19:46.080 --> 19:48.080
Looks like I didn't need to worry.

19:59.090 --> 20:00.260
Are you all right, Tsukki?

20:02.350 --> 20:03.470
You can go on ahead.

20:04.140 --> 20:05.480
I'm fine.

20:07.390 --> 20:08.810
Okay.

20:08.810 --> 20:10.730
I'll be going, then.

20:18.820 --> 20:20.990
Time for personal practice!

20:22.370 --> 20:24.040
Another day of total and utter defeat.

20:27.870 --> 20:30.540
He's as standoffish as usual.

20:30.540 --> 20:31.840
Tsukishima?

20:31.840 --> 20:32.710
Yeah.

20:32.710 --> 20:39.380
I feel like he could, you know... 
do all sorts of things if he actually tried.

20:39.380 --> 20:40.840
All sorts of things?

20:40.840 --> 20:43.600
You know... all sorts.

20:43.600 --> 20:46.270
He's not living up to his 188-cm potential!

20:46.270 --> 20:47.890
Hey, Specky.

20:48.770 --> 20:51.230
Wanna come help us with spike practice again?

20:51.230 --> 20:53.860
Sorry, but I'll pass.

20:53.860 --> 20:55.110
Oh, really?

20:55.110 --> 20:55.940
Kuroo.

20:55.940 --> 20:56.900
Dammit...

20:56.900 --> 20:58.610
I haven't even said anything yet!

20:59.820 --> 21:03.620
Why? Also, you know Fukurodani's ace?

21:03.620 --> 21:04.700
I don't.

21:04.700 --> 21:06.870
Why would you decline?! That's such a waste!

21:06.870 --> 21:08.330
So annoying.

21:08.330 --> 21:11.330
Unlike you, I don't have endless stamina.

21:11.330 --> 21:12.460
What the heck?!

21:12.880 --> 21:15.500
What's his problem?

21:15.500 --> 21:19.800
Fukurodani's ace went out of his way to invite him to practice, but he declined!

21:19.800 --> 21:21.550
That's unbelievable!

21:21.550 --> 21:23.720
You know, Hinata...

21:24.390 --> 21:27.310
What would you say to him right now?

21:27.310 --> 21:28.100
Huh?

21:28.390 --> 21:33.230
Like what you said to Kageyama and Yachi.

21:35.520 --> 21:37.110
I wouldn't say anything.

21:38.440 --> 21:41.860
Because I don't know if Tsukishima wants to play volleyball or not.

21:41.860 --> 21:45.370
Trying to motivate someone who doesn't care doesn't do anything.

21:46.370 --> 21:49.870
Dammit! And he's so tall too!

21:49.870 --> 21:53.670
If I was that tall, I'd do all kinds of things!

21:53.670 --> 21:55.170
I don't...

21:57.090 --> 21:59.840
I don't think he hates volleyball.

22:00.670 --> 22:03.010
If he did, he wouldn't have come to Karasuno.

22:03.890 --> 22:04.930
What about you, Yamaguchi?

22:06.140 --> 22:09.270
What would you say to Tsukishima?

22:16.150 --> 22:16.150
{ED}

22:29.080 --> 22:34.620
We climb the mountain in our way

22:35.170 --> 22:41.210
Losing more than just time in the process

22:41.210 --> 22:47.220
Tasting freedom makes us want to fly

22:47.350 --> 22:53.270
And notice the feelings welling up inside

22:53.560 --> 22:56.690
It's almost in our reach

22:56.690 --> 22:59.770
The closer we get, the more it shines

22:59.770 --> 23:02.570
And stretches out in front of our eyes

23:02.570 --> 23:05.950
That panorama created just for us

23:05.950 --> 23:12.200
Until I reach the top and come back down, my lungs will keep breathing

23:12.200 --> 23:18.460
But now I've been possessed by the desire to climb that summit once again

23:18.460 --> 23:24.300
We cast aside all our doubt and set flight to the skies

23:24.300 --> 23:31.470
Our flailing hands reach out and grab hold of the moment

23:32.850 --> 23:34.480
That special moment

23:35.940 --> 23:40.440
Come to us climbers

23:40.980 --> 23:43.190
Come to us right now

23:46.110 --> 23:46.110
{Preview}

23:46.660 --> 23:49.660
<i>Lev, teach me how to spit watermelon seeds really far!</i>

23:49.660 --> 23:51.370
<i>First, curl up your mouth like a blowgun.</i>

23:51.790 --> 23:53.540
<i>The angle you're gonna spit at is 45 degrees.</i>

23:53.540 --> 23:54.000
<i>I see!</i>

23:54.000 --> 23:56.460
<i>And then bend your body as if it were a whip...</i>

23:57.210 --> 23:58.380
<i>I accidentally swallowed them!</i>

23:57.500 --> 24:01.130
Episode Eight: 
Illusionary Hero

23:57.500 --> 24:01.130
Episode Eight: 
Illusionary Hero

23:58.380 --> 23:59.380
