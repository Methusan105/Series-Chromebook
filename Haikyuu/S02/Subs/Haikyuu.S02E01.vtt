00:44.150 --> 00:45.980

00:48.740 --> 00:50.110
<i>The view from the summit—</i>

00:50.990 --> 00:54.830

00:56.700 --> 00:57.370

01:00.460 --> 01:02.210

I won't stop trying to find the best version of myself

Even if someone tells me that this is as far as I go

02:09.150 --> 02:11.240

02:11.240 --> 02:15.160
I'll say no, thank you, and surge on ahead

Whoo!

03:08.170 --> 03:10.670
Wh-Whoo...

03:11.380 --> 03:12.880
Get used to it already.

03:13.630 --> 03:15.090

03:16.130 --> 03:16.930

Got it!

03:40.660 --> 03:41.580
It's coming again.

03:53.090 --> 03:55.970
It's funny how you keep falling for that.

03:55.970 --> 03:57.430

03:57.430 --> 03:58.720

04:25.790 --> 04:26.620
Yeah!

04:27.290 --> 04:32.340
Rolling... Thunder!

04:33.590 --> 04:37.130
Sorry! I was completely open too!

04:35.920 --> 04:37.130
So annoying...

04:38.170 --> 04:40.890
All right, let's switch gears!

04:41.300 --> 04:42.430

04:43.430 --> 04:44.930

05:11.330 --> 05:13.540
Okay, that's enough for today.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.750
Let us play one more set, please!

05:15.750 --> 05:17.050
Huh?

05:17.050 --> 05:18.210
Please!

05:19.920 --> 05:23.720
Guys, playing until you drop isn't the answer.

05:23.720 --> 05:26.350

05:42.240 --> 05:43.490
Set for me!

05:43.490 --> 05:44.780
Sure.

05:44.780 --> 05:46.700
You guys are still gonna practice?

05:47.160 --> 05:50.660
Hey! We've still got to clean up, so that's enough for today!

05:47.160 --> 05:52.920
<i>They're all definitely realizing their own potential, but what our team lacks is experience.</i>

05:50.660 --> 05:51.790

05:53.250 --> 05:55.590
Hey, make sure you cool down properly.

05:53.710 --> 05:56.630
<i>They definitely haven't had enough 
practice matches against other teams.</i>

05:56.630 --> 05:57.380
Ow!

05:57.920 --> 06:01.510
<i>I can't count on the neighborhood association always being available. What should I do?</i>

06:06.970 --> 06:07.850

06:07.850 --> 06:09.930

06:18.520 --> 06:19.610

Here! A tissue!

06:32.790 --> 06:34.250
A practice match?

06:34.250 --> 06:35.420
Yeah!

06:35.420 --> 06:38.340
But we won't be playing just Nekoma this time.

06:40.250 --> 06:42.470
The Fukurodani Academy Group.

06:42.470 --> 06:46.220
It's a group of schools from the 
Kanto region that includes Nekoma.

06:46.220 --> 06:49.930
Apparently, they hold practice matches regularly.

06:49.930 --> 06:57.400
Thanks to Coach Nekomata, 
we'll be able to take part this time.

06:58.690 --> 07:04.240
Groups like that are created through relationships built up over years,

07:04.240 --> 07:08.030
so it's not easy to get in without connections.

07:08.030 --> 07:10.330
We'll have to make sure to thank Coach Nekomata.

07:10.910 --> 07:14.460
And Mr. Takeda here,
 who I'm sure kept persistently asking him.

07:14.460 --> 07:16.620
No, I didn't really...

07:16.620 --> 07:18.670
Coach Ukai's name helped a lot.

07:18.670 --> 07:19.790
Thank you!

07:24.470 --> 07:30.390
Over the years, we've lost connections with other schools in the prefecture that we used to be friendly with.

07:31.720 --> 07:37.810
There are many schools where the coaches that were once close to Coach Ukai are now gone.

07:38.270 --> 07:40.940
We shouldn't pass up this opportunity.

07:40.940 --> 07:42.400
Yeah!

07:45.280 --> 07:48.780
I'm going to be able to see that setup up-close again.

07:51.870 --> 07:53.870
Maybe I caught a cold.

07:53.870 --> 07:54.910
I'm getting chills.

07:54.910 --> 07:57.250
Hey! We have a tournament soon!

07:57.250 --> 08:00.710
This time, I'm gonna protect us 'til we win!

08:01.040 --> 08:04.420
Yeah... It might actually be a little cold today.

08:04.420 --> 08:05.720
You too, Yaku?!

08:07.010 --> 08:10.050
We're gonna take down that City Boy Alliance!

08:10.050 --> 08:11.510
City Boy...

08:11.510 --> 08:12.470
...Alliance?

08:12.470 --> 08:17.940
I'm feeling hot! I'm burning up!

08:16.230 --> 08:17.940
Yamamoto, shut it.

08:23.860 --> 08:27.280
I'm gonna break through their blocks this time for sure!

08:29.320 --> 08:36.080
Um, the only thing is, their prelims for the interhigh start this weekend, so it won't be right away.

08:36.080 --> 08:39.290
Also, at this point, we've only received the invitation.

08:39.710 --> 08:45.710
There are some things we have to work out, but I'll give you the details another time.

08:45.710 --> 08:47.920
Anyway, it seems like you all...

08:47.920 --> 08:48.760
Of course!

08:49.260 --> 08:50.510
We'll go!

08:54.310 --> 08:57.680
I've got a faculty meeting, so I've got to get going.

08:57.680 --> 09:00.060
Ukai, I'll leave the rest to you.

09:00.060 --> 09:00.600
Sure.

09:00.600 --> 09:01.690
Thank you, sir!

09:02.100 --> 09:03.810
It's going to get busy.

09:03.810 --> 09:04.940
Yeah.

09:04.940 --> 09:06.280
You'll be busy too, Shimizu.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.030
It'll be your first series of away games with us.

09:10.740 --> 09:12.360
I'll do my best too.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.450
C'mon! Hurry and clean up, and then go home!

09:17.450 --> 09:19.710
Yessir!

09:24.960 --> 09:27.170
The food was great!

09:28.130 --> 09:29.130
I wonder who it is.

09:29.130 --> 09:30.880
Is she a third-year?

09:30.880 --> 09:32.380
So pretty...

09:32.380 --> 09:34.390
What's up? Something happening?

09:41.560 --> 09:42.690
Shimizu?!

09:45.020 --> 09:47.820
Hinata knows the hot third-year?!

09:47.820 --> 09:50.860
Wh-What are you do... do...

09:50.860 --> 09:52.240
Hey, Hinata?

09:53.240 --> 09:57.370
Do you know any first-years who haven't joined a club?

We're going for a run.

10:59.510 --> 11:02.600
Hey... Ushiwaka's on the youth world team.

11:02.600 --> 11:03.890
What?

11:03.890 --> 11:05.270
Youth world team?

11:05.270 --> 11:08.610
Simply put, he's representing Japan in the under 19 age group.

11:09.320 --> 11:13.190
Only one high school can represent Miyagi at spring nationals.

11:13.190 --> 11:15.070
For us to go to there,

11:16.200 --> 11:19.280
we'll have to defeat Ushiwaka and Oikawa.

11:26.370 --> 11:27.540
All right!

13:46.470 --> 13:48.720
Wakano 3-chome?

13:49.270 --> 13:52.600
Isn't Wakano near Shiratorizawa?

13:52.600 --> 13:54.690
Shiratorizawa? Like the school Ushiwaka goes to?

13:55.020 --> 13:56.650
Did you need something from me?

14:34.810 --> 14:36.900
We came from Karasuno!

14:36.900 --> 14:39.480
Would you mind if we did some scouting at Shiratorizawa?

14:40.480 --> 14:42.070
<i>Is he serious?!</i>

14:42.070 --> 14:44.530
<i>Aren't you supposed to scout in secret?</i>

14:45.610 --> 14:47.240
Karasuno...

14:47.240 --> 14:49.870
The team that uses that weird fast attack?

Do as you like.

15:28.780 --> 15:30.990
You're just slow!

15:36.750 --> 15:38.880
<i>Unsurprisingly, he keeps a quick pace.</i>

15:38.880 --> 15:41.670
Holy crap! I'm super excited!

16:12.450 --> 16:14.290
Hey. Don't get lost.

16:14.290 --> 16:15.040
I won't!

16:15.370 --> 16:17.080
We've lost sight of Ushijima!

16:17.080 --> 16:18.370
Then we're lost!

16:24.590 --> 16:27.510
This looks like it might be the volleyball team's gym.

16:27.510 --> 16:28.470
Yeah.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.850
Hey, can you see Ushiwaka?

16:39.850 --> 16:41.560
Shut up! And stop pushing me!

16:44.400 --> 16:45.030
Huh?

16:45.480 --> 16:47.440
Isn't that another school?

16:47.440 --> 16:49.740
Is it a practice match? Who're they playing?

16:50.070 --> 16:52.450
Aren't those college students?

16:52.450 --> 16:53.490
College?!

16:53.490 --> 16:58.370
Well, no other high school in the prefecture stands a chance against Shiratorizawa.

16:58.370 --> 17:02.880
They'd have to go outside the prefecture or have a 
college team come in for it to even count as practice.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.420
Curse you, Japan!

17:05.750 --> 17:06.920
Took you long enough.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.380
I'm Kageyama from Karasuno High School.

17:10.380 --> 17:12.010
Would you mind if I had a look?

17:12.430 --> 17:13.640
Kageyama...

17:14.260 --> 17:15.720
From Kitagawa First, right?

17:16.640 --> 17:17.810
Yes.

17:17.810 --> 17:19.430
I applied to this school but wasn't accepted.

17:19.430 --> 17:20.520
That's not surprising.

17:21.980 --> 17:24.980
I remember seeing one of your junior high matches.

17:26.280 --> 17:29.400
We have no need for setters who can't devote themselves to their aces.

17:31.910 --> 17:34.910
It's true. You're not the type that'd be devoting!

17:34.910 --> 17:35.580
What?!

17:36.240 --> 17:39.160
But the same would go for the Great King too, wouldn't it?

17:39.160 --> 17:41.250
And he's the best setter in the prefecture.

17:41.250 --> 17:43.790
Oikawa has nothing to do with this!

17:44.250 --> 17:45.290
Oikawa...

17:45.960 --> 17:48.340
He is an efficient player.

17:48.340 --> 17:50.260
He should have come to our school.

17:52.010 --> 17:55.220
By that, do you mean Oikawa would be able to devote himself to you?

17:55.970 --> 18:01.560
No matter where he is, Oikawa is a setter that can bring out the absolute best in his team.

18:01.560 --> 18:04.690
If the team's absolute best is still bad, there is nothing more to be done.

18:04.690 --> 18:06.900
If it is good, he will make it as good as possible.

18:07.610 --> 18:09.570
That is where his abilities lie.

18:10.900 --> 18:14.990
A sapling must have good soil in order to grow strong.

18:15.620 --> 18:18.620
Good fruit cannot be harvested from barren soil.

18:19.450 --> 18:21.000
Barren soil?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.330
What do you mean?

18:24.250 --> 18:28.880
Other than Oikawa, everyone at Aoba Jousai is bad.

18:30.550 --> 18:31.590
Bad...

18:38.640 --> 18:41.060
If Seijou is barren soil,

18:41.060 --> 18:44.810
does that make us concrete or something?

18:53.450 --> 18:58.280
<i>He usually gets intimidated by tough-looking 
opponents when he first meets them, and yet...</i>

18:59.240 --> 19:01.790
I apologize if I hit a nerve,

19:02.370 --> 19:06.420
but someone on a team that cannot even make it to
 the prefecture finals because they lost to Aoba Jousai

19:06.420 --> 19:09.000
can say all they want, but I will make nothing of it.

19:19.850 --> 19:21.010
<i>He...</i>

19:30.400 --> 19:33.610
I'm Hinata Shouyou, from the concrete.

19:38.450 --> 19:40.080
I'm gonna crush you

19:40.870 --> 19:42.290
and go to nationals.

20:07.690 --> 20:10.110
Hey, are you from another school?

20:10.110 --> 20:12.400
You're not allowed to be here.

20:12.900 --> 20:16.030
Thank you for showing us around.

20:16.030 --> 20:17.200
Excuse us.

20:19.110 --> 20:19.870
Um...

20:20.870 --> 20:23.870
If Oikawa's the best setter in the prefecture,

20:24.540 --> 20:27.210
then I'll be the one to surpass him for that title.

20:30.500 --> 20:31.670
Excuse us.

20:36.760 --> 20:43.260
<i>Stamina, speed, agility, jumping, the will to fight...</i>

20:45.060 --> 20:46.520
<i>Hinata Shouyou.</i>

20:48.100 --> 20:49.690
<i>Kageyama Tobio.</i>

20:59.530 --> 21:01.570
Well, in reality,

21:01.950 --> 21:06.290
it's true that we can't beat Seijou, who can't beat Shiratorizawa.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.870
It doesn't matter if we can defeat them both.

21:09.540 --> 21:10.790
Glad to see we're on the same page.

21:11.630 --> 21:13.460
That's why we're going to Tokyo.

21:13.460 --> 21:17.300
To get better, it's best if we play a lot against strong teams, right?

21:27.350 --> 21:28.560
Let's see here...

21:28.560 --> 21:29.140
Ahem.

21:30.020 --> 21:32.600
About that trip to Tokyo...

21:33.230 --> 21:35.860
For now, we're planning to have it next month.

21:36.860 --> 21:40.360
For trips like this, we'll need 
permission from your guardians.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.610
I'll pass out the paperwork later.

21:42.610 --> 21:46.240
As for consent from the school, it's basically all good.

21:47.120 --> 21:48.370
However,

21:48.830 --> 21:50.540
as I'm sure you are aware,

21:51.080 --> 21:54.630
you have final exams starting next month.

21:57.670 --> 21:59.050
You <i>are</i> aware, right?

22:00.170 --> 22:03.640
So, and I think you know what I'm getting at,

22:04.010 --> 22:06.390
if you fail any subjects,

22:06.810 --> 22:09.720
supplementary classes will be held that weekend.

22:11.890 --> 22:14.650
Which means you won't be able to go on the trip.

22:16.020 --> 22:16.020
{ED}

22:28.990 --> 22:34.540
We climb the mountain in our way

22:35.080 --> 22:41.130
Losing more than just time in the process

22:41.130 --> 22:47.140
Tasting freedom makes us want to fly

22:47.260 --> 22:53.180
And notice the feelings welling up inside

22:53.480 --> 22:56.610
It's almost in our reach

22:56.610 --> 22:59.690
The closer we get, the more it shines

22:59.690 --> 23:02.490
And stretches out in front of our eyes

23:02.490 --> 23:05.860
That panorama created just for us

23:05.860 --> 23:12.120
Until I reach the top and come back down, my lungs will keep breathing

23:12.120 --> 23:18.380
But now I've been possessed by the desire to climb that summit once again

23:18.380 --> 23:24.220
We cast aside all our doubt and set flight to the skies

23:24.220 --> 23:31.390
Our flailing hands reach out and grab hold of the moment

23:32.770 --> 23:34.390
That special moment

23:35.850 --> 23:40.360

23:40.940 --> 23:43.110

23:54.250 --> 23:56.370
