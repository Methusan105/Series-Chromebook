00:00:02.752 --> 00:00:05.422
<i>I'm still thinking about
why I'm going to be executed.</i>

2
00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:07.549
<i>This is all your fault!</i>

3
00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:09.843
<i>I don't want to regret the way I lived.</i>

4
00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:14.597
<i>But what if the person you saved
takes someone else's life later?</i>

5
00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:18.435
<i>You're going to die
in front of a crowd of people.</i>

6
00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:22.272
<i>A secret execution
has been imposed on you.</i>

7
00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:25.525
<i>I'm destined to die. right?</i>

8
00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:31.364
<i>Are you saying that my mother and I
have been cursed by people with hearts?</i>

9
00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.366
<i>What's the right way to die?</i>

10
00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.454
<i>The value of life becomes ambiguous.</i>

11
00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:40.749
<i>I won't understand the value
of someone important to me.</i>

12
00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.209
<i>I'm scared of that.</i>

13
00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:46.421
<i>This is all your fault!</i>

14
00:00:46.504 --> 00:00:49.924
<i>You're going to die
in front of a crowd of people.</i>

15
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:51.426
<i>Save others.</i>

16
00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:53.970
<i>That means I can't die.</i>

17
00:00:55.096 --> 00:01:00.018
<i>So I've never regretted saving you.</i>

18
00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:02.270
<i>That makes us accomplices.</i>

19
00:01:02.353 --> 00:01:05.273
<i>I will never lose again.</i>

20
00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:07.984
<i>I will win.</i>

21
00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:11.654
<i>On the other side...
go apologize to my brothers.</i>

22
00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:14.157
<i>You're strong enough to save others.</i>

23
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.160
<i>Are you prepared. Itadori?</i>

24
00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:19.704
<i>People will die. It's inevitable.</i>

25
00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:22.415
<i>But I want their deaths
to be justified. at least.</i>

26
00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:27.128
<i>If you're killed by a curse.
are you going to blame it on your grandpa?</i>

27
00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:30.799
<i>When I die. I hope many people
will come and pay their last respects.</i>

28
00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:34.719
<i>Someone cried over a life I took.</i>

29
00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:37.722
<i>Those people die because of you!</i>

30
00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:56.921
Malaysia.

31
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.926
That's right. Malaysia.

32
00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:04.262
I should go to Kuantan.

33
00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:08.099
I'll build a house on an empty beach.

34
00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:12.186
<i>The books that I bought but never read
have piled up like a mountain.</i>

35
00:05:13.187 --> 00:05:18.860
<i>I want to read them slowly
as if I'm retrieving the time lost.</i>

36
00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:25.199
<i>No. I should go to save Fushiguro now.</i>

37
00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:30.330
<i>Where are Maki and Naobito?</i>

38
00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:31.873
<i>What happened to them?</i>

39
00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:39.589
<i>I'm tired. I'm really tired.</i>

40
00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:42.550
<i>Yes. I'm tired.</i>

41
00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:47.889
<i>I've done enough.</i>

42
00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.783
{\an8}I didn't know you were here.

43
00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:18.581
I've been here the whole time.

44
00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:29.258
I didn't know you were here.

45
00:08:31.093 --> 00:08:33.513
I've been here the whole time.

46
00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:35.890
Would you like to have a chat with me?

47
00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:39.519
After all. you've played
with me many times.

48
00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.444
<i>Haibara.</i>

49
00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:52.573
<i>in the end. what did I want to do?</i>

50
00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:56.827
<i>I once ran away.</i>

51
00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:59.914
<i>But I came back for a vague reason
like a sense of achievement.</i>

52
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:09.966
<i>No.</i>

53
00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:12.802
<i>that's not right.</i>

54
00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.227
<i>No. Haibara.</i>

55
00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:25.314
<i>I can't say such things.</i>

56
00:09:26.023 --> 00:09:28.442
<i>This could become a curse on him.</i>

57
00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:34.740
Nanamin...

58
00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:48.754
<i>No.</i>

59
00:09:53.342 --> 00:09:54.260
<i>No...</i>

60
00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:03.561
Itadori.

61
00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:22.496
I'll leave the rest to you.

62
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.195
What are you?

63
00:10:56.906 --> 00:11:00.951
What are you. Mahito?

64
00:11:01.035 --> 00:11:04.080
You don't have to shout. I can hear you!

65
00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:06.457
Yuji Itadori!

66
00:11:21.597 --> 00:11:23.474
Save me...

67
00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:34.360
{\an8}Save me.

68
00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:40.366
Soul Multiplicity.

69
00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:43.035
Body Repel.

70
00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:18.737
If I had stood firmer.

71
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:20.823
I could've punched through your face.

72
00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:29.623
How can you... so many times...

73
00:12:30.332 --> 00:12:33.711
How can you play
with so many people's lives?

74
00:12:38.924 --> 00:12:42.761
If I count and kill looking troubled.
would you be satisfied?

75
00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.222
I'll do that next time.

76
00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:50.436
Since you're a shallow guy.
I'll give you a shallow answer.

77
00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:53.522
Yuji Itadori.

78
00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:58.110
Save me...

79
00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:03.324
You are me.

80
00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:08.370
Don't get mad over everything.

81
00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:10.372
This is just a curse talking nonsense.

82
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.461
But still.

83
00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:18.714
as long as you don't acknowledge that...

84
00:13:22.426 --> 00:13:24.386
you are destined to lose to me.

85
00:13:25.137 --> 00:13:29.016
You talk too much...

86
00:13:29.099 --> 00:13:30.226
Are those your last words?

87
00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:33.103
<i>I'll leave the rest to you.</i>

88
00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:36.106
<i>Nanamin would never</i>

89
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.193
<i>lose his cool in anger.</i>

90
00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:41.654
<i>I want to prove...</i>

91
00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:43.405
<i>-You're...
-I'm...</i>

92
00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:48.661
<i>-a Jujutsu sorcerer.
-a Jujutsu sorcerer.</i>

93
00:15:45.527 --> 00:15:47.947
Not bad. keep it up.

94
00:15:50.532 --> 00:15:52.451
The second round!

95
00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:04.505
{\an8}23:19 SHIBUYA STATION
DOGENZAKA TICKET GATE

96
00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:14.510
Oh no.

97
00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:18.055
<i>If I take a risk
and mess up the timing. I could die.</i>

98
00:18:18.138 --> 00:18:21.350
<i>For now. I'll mainly attack
with transfigured humans.</i>

99
00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:22.726
How terrifying.

100
00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:25.229
<i>He has more moves than before.</i>

101
00:18:34.571 --> 00:18:35.447
{\an8}A student?!

102
00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:37.449
{\an8}Hey. hurry over here.

103
00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:39.993
{\an8}There are tons of monsters there.
It's too dangerous!

104
00:18:40.077 --> 00:18:41.578
<i>That guy is</i>

105
00:18:42.079 --> 00:18:43.247
<i>up there?</i>

106
00:18:45.165 --> 00:18:46.416
I'm sorry.

107
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.419
No place in Shibuya is safe now.

108
00:18:49.503 --> 00:18:50.629
You should keep away...

109
00:18:52.589 --> 00:18:55.008
<i>Damn it. he...</i>

110
00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:05.769
Hey. you.

111
00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.691
Don't you think you lack some imagination?

112
00:19:10.774 --> 00:19:11.692
Stop.

113
00:19:11.775 --> 00:19:15.279
Are you an idiot? It's up to you.

114
00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.825
{\an8}<i>This is more effective
against Itadori's soul.</i>

115
00:19:19.908 --> 00:19:25.998
{\an8}<i>And. we'll get
one more trump card to crush you.</i>

116
00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.458
-What?
-Wait...

117
00:19:29.918 --> 00:19:35.549
Alright. swallow...

118
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.219
{\an8}21:30 SHIBUYA STATION. BASEMENT FOUR

119
00:19:39.303 --> 00:19:41.054
{\an8}I have enough in stock.

120
00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:43.849
{\an8}As for the humans except the ones below.
deal with them as you please.

121
00:19:43.932 --> 00:19:47.227
Then let's continue with
the Killing Itadori Show.

122
00:19:48.645 --> 00:19:49.563
No!

123
00:19:49.646 --> 00:19:50.564
Jogo.

124
00:19:51.815 --> 00:19:53.567
Then come get me.

125
00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:59.406
{\an8}I'll head down. and you go up.

126
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.742
{\an8}Come back when I call for you.

127
00:20:02.409 --> 00:20:04.328
{\an8}I know that already.

128
00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:06.205
{\an8}That's true.

129
00:20:08.165 --> 00:20:09.374
{\an8}SPLIT INTO TWO!

130
00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:10.459
{\an8}Bye-bye.

131
00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:13.962
BUMP

132
00:20:16.965 --> 00:20:18.175
He escaped.

133
00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:25.807
Mahito!

134
00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:27.059
{\an8}23:16 DOGENZAKA KOJI

135
00:20:27.142 --> 00:20:28.727
{\an8}You saw that?

136
00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:29.978
{\an8}Crazy. right?

137
00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:33.398
{\an8}I was wandering there not long ago.

138
00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:35.859
Patchwork...

139
00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:37.152
Is it you?

140
00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:40.906
The Special Grade cursed spirit
that messed with our idiot?

141
00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:42.908
Oh my.

142
00:20:43.408 --> 00:20:45.077
Am I a celebrity?

143
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.580
Yeah. you're the famous one
who ran away cowardly.

144
00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.541
Not bad.

145
00:20:52.167 --> 00:20:54.002
Killing you would be worthwhile.

146
00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:57.422
I haven't shown
anything good today anyway.

147
00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:03.262
<i>I remember his technique is
related to souls.</i>

148
00:21:03.345 --> 00:21:05.430
<i>And I can't touch his hands.</i>

149
00:21:06.848 --> 00:21:09.768
At least. I have to exorcise a coward.

150
00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:11.770
<i>I have to recall</i>

151
00:21:12.354 --> 00:21:16.149
<i>the core of cursed energy
that I grasped back then.</i>

152
00:21:18.735 --> 00:21:19.736
Terrible aim.

153
00:21:29.162 --> 00:21:30.122
Hairpin.

154
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:39.631
Very impressive.

155
00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:43.176
But this is basically
ineffective against me.

156
00:21:43.927 --> 00:21:47.931
<i>Judging by the way she talks.
she's probably close with that guy.</i>

157
00:21:48.932 --> 00:21:51.768
<i>I'll show her corpse to Yuji Itadori</i>

158
00:21:51.852 --> 00:21:54.855
<i>to break his soul.</i>

159
00:23:26.863 --> 00:23:28.031
<i>Psychological test.</i>

160
00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:29.699
<i>Who do you remember most vividly?</i>

161
00:23:29.783 --> 00:23:32.160
<i>The one you liked the most
or the one you hated the most?</i>

162
00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:34.204
<i>Stay tuned for the results.</i>

163
00:23:34.287 --> 00:23:35.872
<i>Next episode. Right and Wrong. Part 2.</i>

164
00:23:36.456 --> 00:23:40.460
<i>If your mind is filled with old memories.
it means you're a nerd.</i>
