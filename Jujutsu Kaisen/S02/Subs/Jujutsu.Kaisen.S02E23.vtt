1
00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:46.981
Do you still remember...

2
00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:51.611
the method to make
Cursed Spirits disappear?

3
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.699
No matter what methods are used.

4
00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:00.870
humans will advance to a higher stage.

5
00:02:02.664 --> 00:02:06.292
<i>Next. I should buy Larue some time.</i>

6
00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:10.964
The next stage for humans

7
00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:14.092
is to detach from Cursed Energy.

8
00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.930
Wrong. it's about optimizing
Cursed Energy.

9
00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:27.355
No. I don't understand either of those.

10
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.358
I thought that
when Toji Zenin died 12 years ago.

11
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:33.862
the "detachment" plan
was already abandoned.

12
00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:36.781
I've discussed this with you...

13
00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:39.200
Alright. never mind.

14
00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:42.328
Let's go back to the origin.

15
00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:46.624
Besides. your plan has a major flaw.

16
00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:49.043
<i>Compared to Japan.</i>

17
00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:52.255
<i>there are far fewer Sorcerers
and Cursed Spirits abroad.</i>

18
00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:58.303
Tengen's barrier will be indispensable
for the "Optimization" plan.

19
00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.764
If you want to use Tengen.

20
00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.474
then only people in this country

21
00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:06.769
can optimize Cursed Energy
and become Sorcerers.

22
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:12.442
<i>Cursed Energy will almost
be monopolized by Japan.</i>

23
00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:14.986
<i>Not to mention that country.</i>

24
00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.946
<i>no country in the whole world
will remain silent.</i>

25
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:20.700
<i>Living humans will become
an energy source.</i>

26
00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:24.954
<i>It's easy to imagine what kind
of misfortune will happen. isn't it?</i>

27
00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:31.461
That's not the ideal world
I have depicted.

28
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.089
So what?

29
00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.343
Our goals were different from the start.

30
00:03:39.093 --> 00:03:41.095
What I pursue is not a world
without Cursed Spirits

31
00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:44.098
nor a peaceful world.

32
00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:47.727
Non-Sorcerers. Sorcerers. Cursed Spirits.

33
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.605
All of these are a "possibility."

34
00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:53.483
a possibility of "humans"
as a form of "Cursed Energy."

35
00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:59.364
However. it's certainly
not limited to this.

36
00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:04.869
I have also tried
to create humans by myself.

37
00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:11.584
But that doesn't work.

38
00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:13.378
What I have created

39
00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:16.297
is ultimately limited
by my own possibilities.

40
00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.675
The answer is always

41
00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:22.011
the entity with a black glow amidst chaos.

42
00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.180
Do you understand?

43
00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:25.515
What I should create

44
00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:29.352
is chaos that cannot be controlled by me.

45
00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:33.356
The Cursed Technique has been extracted.

46
00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:37.694
There should be a Cursed Spirit
called Mahito.

47
00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:40.154
The one that can interfere with souls
using Cursed Techniques.

48
00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.990
He just swallowed him.

49
00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:43.283
Seriously?

50
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.745
"Idle Transfiguration."

51
00:05:09.767 --> 00:05:12.520
Tengen's barrier... No.

52
00:05:12.603 --> 00:05:13.646
This is...

53
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.857
the long-range activation
of a Cursed Technique.

54
00:05:16.357 --> 00:05:19.444
I want to thank you. Yuji Itadori.

55
00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:22.196
From the moment
Cursed Spirits are absorbed

56
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.490
through Cursed Spirit Manipulation.

57
00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:28.161
the precision of the technique
won't improve again.

58
00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:31.247
Mahito has grown after battling with you.

59
00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:34.917
Actually. I also wanted Jogo.

60
00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.711
But I didn't get it.

61
00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:38.671
What have you done?

62
00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:42.550
I have used "Idle Transfiguration"
from a distance

63
00:05:42.633 --> 00:05:45.136
on two kinds of non-Sorcerers
that I marked in advance.

64
00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:57.899
TSUMIKI FUSHIGURO

65
00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:14.999
<i>There are those like Yuji Itadori
who swallow Cursed Objects.</i>

66
00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:19.670
<i>And those like Junpei Yoshino
who have Cursed Techniques</i>

67
00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:22.507
<i>but not the brain of Sorcerers.</i>

68
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.260
I adjusted both of their brains
to the ones of the Sorcerers.

69
00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:29.388
The former gained strength
to become a vessel.

70
00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:33.518
The latter learned
how to utilize Cursed Techniques.

71
00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:36.354
Then...

72
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.277
I have lifted the seal
on those Cursed Objects.

73
00:06:44.278 --> 00:06:45.613
<i>When I was marking them.</i>

74
00:06:45.696 --> 00:06:49.408
<i>some people were unconscious
due to my Cursed Energy.</i>

75
00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:51.244
<i>They should be waking up soon.</i>

76
00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:56.833
To make them understand
Cursed Energy better.

77
00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.835
I will make them kill each other.

78
00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:02.755
Those are the children and
Cursed Objects I have carefully selected.

79
00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:04.632
You can imagine it

80
00:07:04.715 --> 00:07:07.552
as a thousand malicious Yuji Itadoris
being released.

81
00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:11.264
A thousand? That's not much.

82
00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:14.183
Moreover. you underestimate
human rationality.

83
00:07:14.892 --> 00:07:18.896
Do you think that with the power granted.
humans will start killing each other?

84
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.774
Order is essential to everything.

85
00:07:22.358 --> 00:07:25.945
How could I possibly have missed
such basic prior preparation?

86
00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:28.823
Your questions are straying
further from the point.

87
00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:34.495
How infuriating. Let's beat him up.

88
00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.831
But I can't move now.

89
00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.548
What's wrong. Uraume?

90
00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:49.093
Using Reverse Cursed Technique
to regenerate the body...

91
00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:50.178
Is this...

92
00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:51.429
Poison?

93
00:07:52.513 --> 00:07:56.184
Piercing Blood contains my blood.
Of course. it's poisonous.

94
00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:59.687
Wait. we don't have Mai's support.

95
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.106
The enemy might have other accomplices.

96
00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:05.443
Aoi. the girl with a gun.

97
00:08:05.526 --> 00:08:08.738
and the girl in the suit are all under
the protection of my companions.

98
00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:10.323
After all. they're unfit to fight now.

99
00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:12.283
Can you still move?

100
00:08:12.366 --> 00:08:16.829
Yeah. I can regulate
my body temperature. It's okay.

101
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.083
I'll pass.

102
00:08:21.709 --> 00:08:23.586
I haven't finished speaking yet.

103
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.380
The Cursed Objects I gave to those people

104
00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:29.967
are the remnants of the Sorcerers
I've made contracts with

105
00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:31.552
since a thousand years ago.

106
00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:36.140
But it's not just Sorcerers
who have made contracts with me...

107
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:41.270
Even though those contracts
had already expired

108
00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:42.730
when I obtained this body.

109
00:08:44.732 --> 00:08:45.733
Could it be...

110
00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:50.279
It's the world of the future.

111
00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:44.417
Goodbye. Yuji Itadori.

112
00:09:46.877 --> 00:09:49.171
Mr. Gojo!

113
00:09:52.049 --> 00:09:54.135
I'm looking forward to your performance.

114
00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:57.930
Did you hear that. Sukuna?

115
00:09:58.014 --> 00:09:58.931
It's starting.

116
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:01.559
The height of sorcery...

117
00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:07.106
The Heian period is about to return.

118
00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:29.670
<i>This is the footage taken by a team
at another interview site</i>

119
00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:34.383
<i>when all this happened
in Tokyo a few days ago.</i>

120
00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:35.968
<i>Please watch it.</i>

121
00:10:38.512 --> 00:10:42.141
<i>The power outage has lasted for about
ten minutes... More than ten minutes.</i>

122
00:10:42.224 --> 00:10:45.269
- Seems like something big happened.
- <i>Currently there's a massive power outage.</i>

123
00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:46.854
Isn't this fake news?

124
00:10:46.937 --> 00:10:50.524
- But they've been reporting it all day.
- <i>Authorities can't be reached.</i>

125
00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:53.194
I'll be home late.
Just microwave something for dinner.

126
00:10:53.277 --> 00:10:55.279
- Okay.
- <i>What exactly happened is still unknown.</i>

127
00:10:55.863 --> 00:10:58.532
District 23 is almost all gone.

128
00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:00.201
Including the Chief Cabinet Secretary.

129
00:11:00.284 --> 00:11:02.703
the condition of all
the Prime Minister's deputies is unknown.

130
00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:06.916
A political vacuum. literally.

131
00:11:07.541 --> 00:11:09.377
No matter how.

132
00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.338
a plan to evacuate five million residents
should be formulated.

133
00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:15.925
Love hotels. campsites.
and abandoned villages.

134
00:11:16.008 --> 00:11:17.885
<i>Even the most basic public facilities.</i>

135
00:11:17.968 --> 00:11:20.221
<i>Get anything we can use.</i>

136
00:11:20.304 --> 00:11:23.808
<i>More importantly.
how do we explain it to the residents?</i>

137
00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:26.394
<i>We don't even know the cause.
What should we tell them?</i>

138
00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:31.315
<i>Furthermore. the government has not
made any public statements yet.</i>

139
00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.692
<i>Whether it's just
a power substation malfunction.</i>

140
00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:35.486
<i>a terrorist attack.</i>

141
00:11:35.569 --> 00:11:38.155
<i>or some kind of natural disaster
like an earthquake...</i>

142
00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:39.949
Too many conspiracy theorists
have emerged.

143
00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:42.576
Stop scrolling on your phone and help me.

144
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.328
Got it.

145
00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:47.164
<i>The only places confirmed to be safe</i>

146
00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:50.751
<i>are the towns and villages of
Okutama. Ome. Akiruno. Hachioji.</i>

147
00:11:51.335 --> 00:11:53.254
<i>part of Machida. and various islands.</i>

148
00:11:53.337 --> 00:11:55.047
<i>Only safe for now. I suppose.</i>

149
00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:58.134
<i>More than ten million
Cursed Spirits were released.</i>

150
00:11:58.217 --> 00:12:01.595
<i>Should we designate the entire
metropolitan area as an evacuation zone?</i>

151
00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:04.014
<i>Then list it as a prohibited area.</i>

152
00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:05.766
<i>It's simply hell.</i>

153
00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:08.769
<i>But how do we tell the public?</i>

154
00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:09.854
<i>Who should come forward?</i>

155
00:12:09.937 --> 00:12:12.690
<i>Compared to that.
the issue is how to make the statement.</i>

156
00:12:12.773 --> 00:12:14.775
<i>We still haven't reached
the deputy commissioner yet?</i>

157
00:12:17.027 --> 00:12:18.529
<i>No.</i>

158
00:12:18.612 --> 00:12:20.781
<i>We can't get in touch
with the secretary either.</i>

159
00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:25.286
<i>What should we do now?</i>

160
00:12:25.369 --> 00:12:26.787
<i>Calm down.</i>

161
00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:28.789
<i>The higher-ups have
their own considerations.</i>

162
00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:32.793
<i>We should just contact
each provincial office.</i>

163
00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:35.629
{\an8}The yen keeps depreciating.

164
00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:37.923
{\an8}Isn't that beneficial for exports?

165
00:12:38.507 --> 00:12:40.050
The economic groups are furious?

166
00:12:40.134 --> 00:12:43.012
Once everyone is dead.
those lobbying groups will be meaningless.

167
00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:46.307
<i>Relocate the office to Osaka.</i>

168
00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:49.310
<i>At this rate. tons of Cursed Spirits
will be everywhere.</i>

169
00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:53.230
<i>But now. most Sorcerers are
protecting the people</i>

170
00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:54.523
<i>in the metropolitan area.</i>

171
00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:56.442
<i>With such a large-scale power vacuum.</i>

172
00:12:56.525 --> 00:12:58.319
<i>there could be
a foreign military intervention.</i>

173
00:12:58.402 --> 00:12:59.528
<i>Yes.</i>

174
00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.322
<i>Eh? No.</i>

175
00:13:01.405 --> 00:13:02.615
<i>Yes.</i>

176
00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:04.325
<i>I understand.</i>

177
00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:09.580
We need to disclose
the existence of Cursed Spirits.

178
00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.666
We're making it public?

179
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.126
<i>Seriously?</i>

180
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:18.380
<i>Declare that the Cursed Spirits
will only appear in Tokyo.</i>

181
00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:21.300
<i>To draw the Cursed Energy
emitted by ordinary people to Tokyo.</i>

182
00:13:21.383 --> 00:13:24.261
<i>so that the Cursed Spirits
will only be limited to Tokyo?</i>

183
00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:28.891
<i>That's why when KIX was completed.
I recommended transferring it to Itami.</i>

184
00:13:28.974 --> 00:13:31.227
<i>Isn't that just right?</i>

185
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:34.688
<i>If Kasumigaseki was still operating.
we wouldn't make this kind of judgment.</i>

186
00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:40.736
<i>Uh... We'll repeat that for you once more.</i>

187
00:13:40.819 --> 00:13:43.364
<i>The power outage is continuing.</i>

188
00:13:43.447 --> 00:13:45.115
<i>We're still unable to contact
various units.</i>

189
00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:46.951
<i>Also. due to the lack
of any public statement.</i>

190
00:13:47.034 --> 00:13:49.119
<i>the cause remains unclear.</i>

191
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.039
{\an8}<i>How long will this situation last...</i>

192
00:13:52.122 --> 00:13:59.129
{\an8}ABNORMALITIES IN THE CITY CENTER?
DAMAGE CONTINUES TO ESCALATE

193
00:13:59.213 --> 00:14:02.716
{\an8}<i>What? What's going on?</i>

194
00:14:07.137 --> 00:14:14.144
PLEASE WAIT A MOMENT

195
00:14:16.146 --> 00:14:17.147
What's going on?

196
00:14:17.898 --> 00:14:18.899
Making a movie?

197
00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:25.030
<i>The barrier centered on
the Imperial Palace.</i>

198
00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:26.282
<i>rebuilt during the Meiji era.</i>

199
00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:28.742
<i>and the other barrier centered
above the Tombs of the Star</i>

200
00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:31.745
<i>at the candidate site for the capital
at the end of the Edo period.</i>

201
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:34.790
<i>Expand those two barriers
to the prefectural borders.</i>

202
00:15:43.525 --> 00:15:48.781
Come over... It's dangerous here.

203
00:15:58.415 --> 00:16:01.043
Take a hot bath.

204
00:16:06.173 --> 00:16:08.676
You can sing too.

205
00:16:14.723 --> 00:16:15.933
What about my mom?

206
00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:21.563
Your mom and dad.

207
00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:25.776
your sister. brother.
and your teacher are all here.

208
00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:31.156
I don't have a brother.

209
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.992
And I hate teachers.

210
00:16:33.075 --> 00:16:36.996
I don't have a brother.

211
00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:41.333
And I hate teachers.

212
00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:45.337
Are you okay? Want a drink?

213
00:16:50.592 --> 00:16:53.095
Give me.

214
00:17:28.172 --> 00:17:29.006
Sorry.

215
00:17:30.674 --> 00:17:31.675
Did I scare you?

216
00:17:35.012 --> 00:17:36.013
Are you hurt?

217
00:17:39.183 --> 00:17:40.976
Are you with someone?

218
00:17:42.519 --> 00:17:44.646
Where's your father or mother?

219
00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:47.232
I don't know.

220
00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:50.903
<i>All commercial buildings are in this area.</i>

221
00:17:50.986 --> 00:17:52.613
<i>She probably doesn't live around here.</i>

222
00:17:54.364 --> 00:17:55.783
You've walked a long way. right?

223
00:17:58.994 --> 00:18:02.039
I see. that's hard.

224
00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:11.799
Can you see it?

225
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.302
Don't do that. Rika.

226
00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:17.346
It's gone too far.

227
00:18:20.015 --> 00:18:22.017
Sorry. I hesitated at the time.

228
00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:25.729
I thought with this situation.

229
00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:28.816
why not just play the long game and wait?

230
00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:31.527
Have you noticed?

231
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.613
I'm not really on your side.

232
00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:38.200
I'm just an ordinary beauty.

233
00:18:38.283 --> 00:18:40.285
hoping that the Cursed Spirits
would disappear.

234
00:18:41.829 --> 00:18:43.997
Although it doesn't count as an apology.

235
00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:47.042
my friends and I will take responsibility

236
00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:49.419
and send back the children
who were present.

237
00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:52.714
And it's about time

238
00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:55.717
for me to face Tengen.

239
00:18:59.596 --> 00:19:00.764
What are your plans?

240
00:19:08.564 --> 00:19:10.399
<i>Good work. Okkotsu.</i>

241
00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:12.734
You're not sincere anyway.

242
00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:14.653
Let's get to the point.

243
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:20.242
Now. you should understand
that I follow orders.

244
00:19:22.244 --> 00:19:26.248
<i>Killing Cursed Spirits
doesn't prove anything.</i>

245
00:19:27.791 --> 00:19:30.544
Well. you can set up
a Binding Vow or whatever.

246
00:19:31.378 --> 00:19:34.047
It doesn't matter
whether he's Mr. Gojo's student.

247
00:19:35.215 --> 00:19:39.678
<i>He cut off Inumaki's arm in Shibuya.</i>

248
00:19:41.305 --> 00:19:45.559
I will kill Yuji Itadori.

249
00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:50.856
Jujutsu Headquarters Notice

250
00:19:50.939 --> 00:19:55.736

He will be permanently expelled
from the realm of sorcery.

254
00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:09.374
Unsealing him will be considered
a criminal act.

255
00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:15.881

261
00:22:08.035 --> 00:22:10.954
