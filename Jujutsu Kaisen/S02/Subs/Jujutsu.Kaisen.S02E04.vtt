WEBVTT

00:01.140 --> 00:03.560
Let's go home, Riko-chan.

00:04.150 --> 00:05.100
Yeah!

00:16.160 --> 00:17.580
Riko-chan?

00:19.120 --> 00:21.080
Okay, job's done.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.410
You're free to go now.

00:24.170 --> 00:26.330
Why are you here?

00:27.040 --> 00:28.590
Why?

00:28.960 --> 00:31.170
Oh, that's what you mean.

00:32.050 --> 00:34.930
Because I killed Satoru Gojo.

00:34.930 --> 00:36.390
Is that so?

00:36.390 --> 00:37.430
Die!

01:12.170 --> 01:13.960
Don't be so impatient.

01:13.960 --> 01:16.970
<b>Episode 28
Hidden Inventory 4</b>

01:26.100 --> 01:31.110
<b>JUJUTSU KAISEN
Hidden Inventory/Premature Death</b>

02:56.190 --> 02:58.110
The Tombs of the Star 
and the Forbidden Vault

02:58.110 --> 02:59.700
use barriers that conceal.

03:00.030 --> 03:02.200
So they can't place guards at the entrances.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.580
As long as you know where the doors are,

03:05.580 --> 03:07.160
they're full of holes.

03:07.620 --> 03:10.410
Sorcerers are busy during this time of year,

03:10.410 --> 03:13.830
and Jujutsu High is brimming 
with Fly Heads right now.

03:13.830 --> 03:16.300
It's pure chaos outside.

03:16.690 --> 03:20.220
And since I have no cursed energy, 
I'm like the invisible man.

03:20.580 --> 03:23.180
There was one problem, though.

03:23.750 --> 03:25.180
If I wield a cursed tool,

03:25.580 --> 03:29.270
the cursed energy from it will stop 
me from being an invisible man.

03:36.770 --> 03:38.610
Now, there's more to this story.

03:40.360 --> 03:43.950
See, I keep a cursed spirit 
capable of storing objects around.

03:43.950 --> 03:46.620
So I usually put my cursed tools 
in it when I'm walking around.

03:48.120 --> 03:49.700
You don't have to say it.

03:49.700 --> 03:51.410
Yes, that means the cursed energy from

03:51.410 --> 03:54.250
the cursed spirit should stop me 
from being an invisible man.

03:56.960 --> 04:01.420
So I make the cursed spirit smaller,
until it can fit inside my body.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.550
Then I keep it inside my stomach.

04:05.550 --> 04:08.640
After all, the organs of the invisible 
man are invisible, too, right?

04:08.980 --> 04:11.640
That's how I'm able to 
pass through any barrier

04:11.640 --> 04:14.100
while still carrying 
all kinds of cursed tools.

04:17.770 --> 04:21.940
That's also why I didn't use 
a cursed tool at first.

04:23.780 --> 04:25.820
A surprise attack on the Six Eyes

04:25.820 --> 04:28.410
would be pointless if I wasn't invisible.

04:28.800 --> 04:32.000
I could've killed the Star Plasma Vessel first,

04:32.000 --> 04:34.540
but the risk of the Six Eyes seeing me was too—

04:34.540 --> 04:35.460
Enough.

04:35.460 --> 04:37.250
You have a Heavenly Pact, right?

04:37.250 --> 04:38.960
I know revealing information about

04:38.960 --> 04:42.420
your ability increases its fundamental 
strength, just like for a sorcerer.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.930
That's not what I want to know.

04:46.590 --> 04:49.470
How did you know which doors 
led to the Tombs of the Star?

04:49.890 --> 04:53.180
We didn't leave even 
the slightest residuals.

04:53.540 --> 04:56.870
Humans leave plenty of 
traces aside from residuals.

04:56.870 --> 04:59.320
Like scents, footprints, and so on.

04:59.320 --> 05:01.780
My pact enhances all five of my senses, too.

05:02.070 --> 05:04.860
There should have been 
another woman on the way here.

05:04.860 --> 05:06.240
What happened to her?

05:06.240 --> 05:07.240
Hm?

05:07.660 --> 05:10.080
Oh, that maid?

05:10.080 --> 05:11.620
She's probably dead.

05:11.620 --> 05:13.950
I didn't care if she lived or died, though.

05:13.950 --> 05:15.660
If she's lucky, she might still be alive.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.580
Is that so?

05:17.580 --> 05:20.460
You really should... die!

06:01.480 --> 06:03.900
<i>That Rainbow Dragon has 
the toughest hide there is!</i>

06:12.140 --> 06:14.100
Curse Manipulation...

06:14.970 --> 06:16.230
Riffraff.

06:29.250 --> 06:31.070
Hey, am...

06:31.070 --> 06:33.830
Am... Am I...

06:33.830 --> 06:35.410
pretty?

06:36.650 --> 06:38.250
<i>A potential apparition?</i>

06:38.250 --> 06:40.040
<i>It deploys a simple domain that</i>

06:40.040 --> 06:43.760
<i>enforces non-violence on both of us 
until I answer its question, then?</i>

06:44.380 --> 06:46.590
Ah, well...

06:46.590 --> 06:48.420
Then I'll just come out and say

06:48.420 --> 06:49.690
you're not my type.

06:55.470 --> 06:57.180
So that's how it is.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.150
Idiot.

07:05.150 --> 07:06.360
It's over.

07:06.940 --> 07:08.110
For you!

07:11.700 --> 07:13.370
<i>Curse Manipulation.</i>

07:13.820 --> 07:15.950
<i>It's a technique that lets me 
absorb cursed spirits</i>

07:15.950 --> 07:18.370
<i>that have surrendered, 
and freely manipulate them.</i>

07:18.370 --> 07:21.330
<i>If there's roughly a two-grade 
difference in our levels,</i>

07:21.330 --> 07:22.750
<i>I skip making them submit</i>

07:22.750 --> 07:24.920
<i>and absorb them unconditionally.</i>

07:26.340 --> 07:29.780
<i>His cursed spirit may have a unique ability, 
but it's not that strong itself.</i>

07:30.340 --> 07:32.930
<i>I can absorb it. That'll lock down his armory.</i>

07:33.930 --> 07:35.800
<i>Then I can just brute-force him—</i>

08:03.290 --> 08:06.460
I didn't cut you badly enough to kill you.

08:06.780 --> 08:09.000
I would've killed you if 
you were a shikigami user,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.380
but since it's Curse Manipulation,

08:11.720 --> 08:15.810
there's no telling what might happen to the 
cursed spirits you've absorbed after you die.

08:17.150 --> 08:19.780
I'd rather avoid extra trouble here.

08:20.310 --> 08:22.020
You have the blessing of parentage.

08:22.770 --> 08:25.770
But even with that blessing,

08:26.100 --> 08:30.320
you were all beaten by a monkey like me 
who can't even use cursed techniques.

08:31.050 --> 08:33.570
If you want to live a long life, 
never forget that.

08:37.550 --> 08:40.040
Oh, speaking of blessings...

08:40.040 --> 08:42.000
That's right. I almost forgot.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.210
I named him Megumi.

Thank you, Founder.

09:35.270 --> 09:36.600
You're so generous.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.690
He's not the founder.

09:38.690 --> 09:39.690
Huh?

09:40.900 --> 09:42.310
Do you mean it?

09:42.310 --> 09:46.070
I know it was a necessary expense, 
but you've already helped us out a lot, too.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.740
I thought you'd complain a bit more.

09:50.330 --> 09:54.030
We hired you for the assassination 
expecting that it would fail.

09:54.030 --> 09:55.990
Our Star Religious Group 
was founded in the Nara Era,

09:55.990 --> 09:59.210
when Tengen-sama began preaching

09:59.210 --> 10:01.580
about the moral foundation 
of jujutsu sorcerers,

10:01.580 --> 10:04.160
a minority, as Buddhism 
spread throughout Japan.

10:04.790 --> 10:08.300
Jujutsu society and religious corporations 
are at complete odds with each other.

10:08.300 --> 10:10.550
That strain is what gave birth

10:10.550 --> 10:14.890
to our modern Star Religious Group, 
the Time Vessel Association.

10:14.890 --> 10:18.310
That is also why we have devoted 
ourselves to remaining non-sorcerers.

10:18.880 --> 10:22.150
Jujutsu sorcerers are granted 
many privileges above the law,

10:22.150 --> 10:25.070
but they're still fundamentally forbidden 
to lay a hand on non-sorcerers.

10:25.480 --> 10:28.110
However, the time had finally arrived.

10:28.570 --> 10:32.360
The time of the taboo 
recorded in our scriptures!

10:32.740 --> 10:34.450
Our Star Religious Group has evolved to

10:34.450 --> 10:36.660
a monotheistic religion 
worshiping one absolute god!

10:36.660 --> 10:40.710
And it was now time for our object of 
worship to assimilate with that impurity!

10:42.620 --> 10:45.590
If our believers saw us simply sit back 
and watch the assimilation happen,

10:45.590 --> 10:47.340
our Association would crumble.

10:48.050 --> 10:52.590
Yet if we took excessive action, 
jujutsu sorcerers would crush us.

10:52.880 --> 10:56.350
So we were truly desperate.

10:56.350 --> 10:58.560
And how did it all turn out?

10:58.560 --> 11:00.980
We thought we were going to lose everything,

11:00.980 --> 11:03.100
and now we have it all!

11:03.400 --> 11:06.570
Of course that would 
loosen our purse strings.

11:08.530 --> 11:14.110
Human society might be what crumbles 
if Tengen-sama loses control, though.

11:16.070 --> 11:19.700
If we should perish along with our star, 
then that is all there is to it.

11:31.360 --> 11:34.760
Were you referring to Okinawa 
when you said they helped us?

11:34.760 --> 11:35.630
Yeah.

11:35.970 --> 11:39.180
Why didn't you kill the maid then?

11:39.180 --> 11:40.590
I know I told you,

11:40.820 --> 11:44.310
"Take her someplace far away, 
and kill her at some point."

11:44.850 --> 11:49.070
Because I had a good idea of what 
you were planning at the time.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.140
I made the call that the relief 
from the maid's successful rescue

11:52.140 --> 11:55.990
would wear him down more than 
heightened tensions from failure.

11:56.490 --> 12:01.940
You often ignore the lines of communication 
and toss out whatever I was planning, right?

12:02.620 --> 12:04.580
It all worked out in the end.

12:04.580 --> 12:07.830
And stop running your mediator ragged.

12:07.830 --> 12:10.590
Yeah, but why Okinawa?

12:12.590 --> 12:14.880
I had a laugh at that myself.

12:14.880 --> 12:18.050
Normally, you'd use a car 
to transport a captive, right?

12:18.050 --> 12:21.260
Public transportation carries 
too many risks, after all.

12:21.640 --> 12:25.810
But get this. The president 
owned his own private jet.

12:26.440 --> 12:28.690
Even so...

12:30.690 --> 12:33.650
Rich people think on a different scale, man.

12:33.650 --> 12:35.990
Well, let's go eat with their money.

12:35.990 --> 12:38.620
Take me to one of the 
restaurants you use for clients.

12:39.580 --> 12:40.620
No way.

12:40.620 --> 12:42.620
You never pay for a guy, anyway.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.410
I've already decided I'll only see you

12:46.410 --> 12:49.630
either for work or in Hell.

13:06.800 --> 13:07.850
Huh?

13:10.940 --> 13:13.650
Hey, it's been a while.

13:14.900 --> 13:16.150
For real?

13:16.400 --> 13:18.110
For real, real.

13:19.070 --> 13:21.370
I'm alive and kicking!

13:21.780 --> 13:23.560
Reverse cursed technique!

13:24.200 --> 13:25.830
Bingo!

13:25.830 --> 13:28.430
When you stabbed me through the throat,

13:28.430 --> 13:29.960
I gave up on counterattacking

13:29.960 --> 13:32.790
and poured all my focus into 
the reverse cursed technique.

13:33.420 --> 13:35.460
Cursed energy is negative energy.

13:35.460 --> 13:38.680
While it can enhance the body, 
it can't regenerate it.

13:38.680 --> 13:43.260
So you multiply that negative energy 
against itself to create positive energy.

13:43.260 --> 13:45.020
That's the reverse cursed technique.

13:45.020 --> 13:46.850
Easier said than done!

13:46.850 --> 13:49.220
I hadn't been able to do 
that up until now myself!

13:49.220 --> 13:52.810
And I couldn't understand anything 
the one person who could do it said!

13:51.060 --> 13:52.810
<i>He's blabbing on and on...</i>

13:53.190 --> 13:56.530
<i>He's high.</i>

13:57.070 --> 13:59.480
But I finally grasped it 
on the verge of death!

13:59.480 --> 14:01.480
The true essence of cursed energy!

14:01.480 --> 14:05.080
The reason you're going to lose is 
because you didn't chop my head off,

14:05.080 --> 14:08.750
and because you didn't use that cursed 
tool when you stabbed my head.

14:09.250 --> 14:10.750
I'm going to lose?

14:13.540 --> 14:15.540
Our fight is just getting started.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.960
Oh? Is it?

14:17.960 --> 14:19.470
Yeah...

14:19.470 --> 14:21.260
Maybe so!

14:34.610 --> 14:36.150
<i>Cursed Technique Reversal:</i>

14:38.280 --> 14:39.150
<i>Red.</i>

14:54.460 --> 14:55.910
Monster.

15:03.050 --> 15:04.760
<i>No bones are broken.</i>

15:05.260 --> 15:08.680
<i>That shock wave was an 
application of Limitless,</i>

15:08.680 --> 15:10.720
<i>the cursed technique reversal, Red, huh?</i>

15:11.730 --> 15:15.190
<i>So he poured the positive energy generated 
by the reverse cursed technique</i>

15:15.190 --> 15:19.990
<i>into the Limitless 
technique ingrained into him.</i>

15:20.530 --> 15:22.570
<i>One, the power to stop:</i>

15:22.570 --> 15:24.740
<i>the neutral application 
of the Limitless technique.</i>

15:26.170 --> 15:28.410
<i>Two, the power to attract:</i>

15:28.410 --> 15:31.120
<i>the amplified application of 
the Limitless technique, Blue.</i>

15:32.200 --> 15:34.580
<i>And three, the power to repel:</i>

15:34.580 --> 15:36.420
<i>the reversal of his cursed technique, Red.</i>

15:39.460 --> 15:42.330
<i>All things I can handle.</i>

15:44.300 --> 15:45.300
<i>Something's off.</i>

15:51.180 --> 15:52.430
<i>Something's off.</i>

15:55.460 --> 15:57.440
No, this is fine.

15:59.730 --> 16:00.980
I'll kill you.

16:21.160 --> 16:23.470
<i>Sorry, Amanai.</i>

16:23.970 --> 16:27.470
<i>I'm not even angry over you right now.</i>

16:28.680 --> 16:30.680
<i>I bear no grudge against anyone.</i>

16:33.010 --> 16:37.700
<i>It's just that the world feels 
so, so wonderful right now.</i>

16:54.940 --> 16:57.960
"Throughout Heaven and Earth, 
I alone am the honored one."

17:01.640 --> 17:04.670
<i>The merit of having a technique 
that's passed down for generations</i>

17:04.670 --> 17:06.260
<i>is having a user's manual.</i>

17:07.180 --> 17:08.720
<i>The demerit is that</i>

17:08.720 --> 17:11.640
<i>information about the
technique is easily leaked.</i>

17:11.640 --> 17:14.600
<i>You were a member of 
the Zen'in clan, weren't you?</i>

17:15.120 --> 17:18.480
<i>That's why you know so much 
about the Limitless technique.</i>

17:20.150 --> 17:23.320
<i>However, even in the Gojo clan,</i>

17:23.320 --> 17:25.610
<i>only a scant few know about this.</i>

17:36.680 --> 17:38.710
<i>Take the amplified and the reversal,</i>

17:38.710 --> 17:41.540
<i>then smash together those 
two different expressions</i>

17:41.580 --> 17:44.210
<i>of infinity to create and 
push out imaginary mass.</i>

17:44.550 --> 17:46.970
<i>Hollow Purple.</i>

17:56.100 --> 17:57.560
<i>Something's off.</i>

17:59.190 --> 18:01.480
<i>"I refuse to do any work for free."</i>

18:01.810 --> 18:05.110
<i>Normally I would've said that 
and hightailed it out of there.</i>

18:06.070 --> 18:10.820
<i>Yet the freshly awakened wielder of the 
Limitless technique was right before my eyes.</i>

18:11.360 --> 18:14.450
<i>He was probably the strongest jujutsu 
sorcerer of the modern age.</i>

18:15.200 --> 18:17.200
<i>I wanted to reject him.</i>

18:17.200 --> 18:19.290
<i>I wanted to bring him to his knees.</i>

18:19.760 --> 18:23.040
<i>I wanted to take down the 
pinnacle of the jujutsu world</i>

18:23.040 --> 18:24.670
<i>and the Zen'in clan that rejected me.</i>

18:25.750 --> 18:30.630
<i>I twisted myself to try to affirm myself.</i>

18:31.930 --> 18:34.680
<i>That was the moment I lost.</i>

18:44.400 --> 18:46.690
<i>I thought you had abandoned that pride.</i>

18:47.980 --> 18:54.280
<i>I thought you had chosen to live without 
respecting yourself or anyone else.</i>

18:58.700 --> 19:01.200
Any last words?

19:04.130 --> 19:05.670
Nah.

19:17.060 --> 19:19.270
Two or three years from now,

19:19.270 --> 19:21.940
my kid will be sold off to the Zen'in clan.

19:22.730 --> 19:24.600
Do what you will with that.

21:24.220 --> 21:26.270
Mommy!

21:26.640 --> 21:28.640
Hug me!

22:07.630 --> 22:09.430
You're late, Suguru.

22:09.860 --> 22:12.100
No, I guess you got here fast.

22:12.530 --> 22:16.390
There are several Star Religious 
Group facilities in the city, after all.

22:17.740 --> 22:20.360
Satoru? Is that you?

22:21.170 --> 22:22.820
What happened?

22:23.360 --> 22:25.490
I see you already saw Shoko.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.910
Yeah, she healed me.

22:28.390 --> 22:29.870
I'm fine now.

22:32.950 --> 22:36.380
No, me being safe doesn't 
help anything here.

22:36.740 --> 22:38.300
I screwed up.

22:38.300 --> 22:39.750
You're not at fault.

22:40.760 --> 22:41.880
Let's head back.

22:42.380 --> 22:46.010
Suguru, should we kill these guys?

22:46.780 --> 22:49.720
The way I feel right now, 
I doubt I'd feel anything about it.

22:52.260 --> 22:54.690
No. There's no point.

22:55.520 --> 22:59.060
It looks like there are only 
common believers here.

22:59.460 --> 23:02.950
The masterminds who know about our 
world have probably fled already.

23:03.740 --> 23:05.780
And unlike with the bounty,

23:05.780 --> 23:08.490
they won't be able to 
talk their way out of this.

23:08.490 --> 23:10.910
The organization had 
problems to begin with.

23:11.270 --> 23:12.880
It'll be dissolved soon enough.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.170
No point, huh?

23:16.540 --> 23:19.670
Does there really need 
to be any point to it?

23:31.350 --> 23:33.180
It's very important that there is.

23:33.850 --> 23:36.810
Especially for a jujutsu sorcerer.

23:40.270 --> 23:42.800
I wonder if whoever came up with the phrase

23:42.800 --> 23:45.070
"a surprising side" 
thought of people as cubes,

23:45.070 --> 23:47.400
and if whoever came up with the insult

23:47.400 --> 23:49.830
"shallow" thought of people as flat surfaces?

23:49.830 --> 23:51.540
Next time, "Premature Death."

23:49.900 --> 23:54.820
<b>Next Episode
Premature Death</b>

23:51.540 --> 23:54.580
Either way, people do have two sides to them.
