00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.787
There are so many of them.

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:40.123
<i>I can't just watch it happen.</i>

5
00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:42.459
<i>But I don't have time to save everyone.</i>

6
00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.419
<i>Damn. What should I do...</i>

7
00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:47.922
<i>The station...
Mr. Gojo is right there before me.</i>

8
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:49.215
Spicy cod roe.

9
00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:50.300
That voice...

10
00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:53.887
-Inumaki!
-Salmon.

11
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.804
I'll leave it to you!

12
00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:55.889
Salmon.

13
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:06.066

<i>Yuji Itadori.</i>

18
00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:35.256
<i>I will avenge my brothers.</i>

19
00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:39.761
<i>Convergence.</i>

20
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:44.057
<i>Blood Manipulation. Convergence.</i>

21
00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:48.978
<i>This technique compresses blood
and condenses it to its limit.</i>

22
00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:55.526
<i>The condensed blood is released
through a single point.</i>

23
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.528
<i>The blood enhanced by cursed energy</i>

24
00:03:57.612 --> 00:04:02.116
<i>is shot at supersonic speed.</i>

25
00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:05.620
<i>Blood Manipulation secret technique...</i>

26
00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:07.622
<i>Its name is...</i>

27
00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:10.375
<i>Piercing Blood.</i>

28
00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.558
<i>A double impact.
What a strange technique.</i>

29
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.701
I have...

30
00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.620
a question for you.

31
00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:52.333
Did my brothers leave any final words?

32
00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:54.168
Your brothers?

33
00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:58.089
The two men that you killed.

34
00:05:00.758 --> 00:05:02.760
No. nothing.

35
00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:05.263
But...

36
00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:08.683
They cried.

37
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.689
Eso. Kechizu.

38
00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:20.153
Just watch.

39
00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:22.739
This is...

40
00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:25.950
your elder brother!

41
00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:45.196
<i>Damn it.</i>

42
00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.783
<i>He's taking a distance again.</i>

43
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.786
<i>His blood beam is too fast.</i>

44
00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:53.704
<i>I only have a 50% chance of dodging it.</i>

45
00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:56.207
{\an8}<i>If I guess wrong and get hit on the head.</i>

46
00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.334
<i>I will die.</i>

47
00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.421
<i>Then at least...</i>

48
00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:12.849
<i>I control the timing of the launch.</i>

49
00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:14.725
<i>He's luring me to attack.</i>

50
00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:16.436
<i>I am all in.</i>

51
00:07:36.497 --> 00:07:37.874
<i>I knew it.</i>

52
00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:40.376
<i>This technique is only fast
at the beginning.</i>

53
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.628
<i>Once I dodge it. I can approach him.</i>

54
00:07:44.672 --> 00:07:46.132
Supernova.

55
00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:20.917
I was too hasty.

56
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.712
<i>It wasn't condensed enough.</i>

57
00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:29.592
<i>Damn. this guy...</i>

58
00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:33.971
<i>He is really strong.</i>

59
00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:34.889
<i>Hey.</i>

60
00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:38.100
<i>Hey. what's the situation now?</i>

61
00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:40.811
Mechamaru. why didn't you...

62
00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:43.856
<i>Saving energy.
There is something else I must do...</i>

63
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.275
<i>Choso! Is it Blood Manipulation?</i>

64
00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.193
You know it?

65
00:08:47.276 --> 00:08:49.111
<i>Kamo uses the same cursed technique.</i>

66
00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:52.698
That third-year with narrow eyes?

67
00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:53.950
So you...

68
00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:55.826
<i>I don't know the weakness
of this technique.</i>

69
00:08:56.327 --> 00:09:00.081
<i>Blood Manipulation is one of
the highly valued techniques</i>

70
00:09:00.164 --> 00:09:01.999
<i>passed down through the Kamo Family.</i>

71
00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:05.253
<i>Convergence compresses
and condenses blood.</i>

72
00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:07.421
<i>making Piercing Blood
and Blood Edge possible.</i>

73
00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:09.173
<i>Whether it's close. mid.
or long-range.</i>

74
00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:12.260
<i>it's valued for its overall balance.</i>

75
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.137
<i>Choso doesn't suffer blood loss.
so he has no weakness.</i>

76
00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.764
Thanks for the useful info...

77
00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:21.727
<i>I don't know his weakness.
but I have an idea.</i>

78
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.104
What is it?

79
00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:24.981
<i>Go to the bathroom.</i>

80
00:09:25.064 --> 00:09:26.524
The bathroom? Why?

81
00:09:26.607 --> 00:09:28.609
<i>I'll explain later.</i>

82
00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:30.945
<i>It has only a 10% chance of success.</i>

83
00:09:31.028 --> 00:09:33.781
<i>Sorry. but if it fails.
just die gracefully.</i>

84
00:09:33.864 --> 00:09:34.824
Come on.

85
00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:37.827
<i>Dragging out will only make it worse.
You'll get killed by him anyway.</i>

86
00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:47.837
Idiot.

87
00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:51.424
<i>There's only an elevator and bathrooms.</i>

88
00:09:51.507 --> 00:09:54.427
<i>I'll catch you
no matter where you run off to.</i>

89
00:09:58.764 --> 00:10:00.016
<i>What's that sound?</i>

90
00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:03.436
<i>He defeated my brothers.</i>

91
00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:05.396
<i>An idiot can never do that.</i>

92
00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:09.191
<i>And I heard the second voice
coming out of nowhere...</i>

93
00:10:10.526 --> 00:10:14.280
<i>He's definitely up to something.
I have to be careful.</i>

94
00:10:14.363 --> 00:10:15.448
<i>What?</i>

95
00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:16.991
<i>Aren't you coming over?</i>

96
00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:19.952
<i>You are such a coward.</i>

97
00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:22.038
<i>Just like your little brothers.</i>

98
00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:24.540
I'll kill you!

99
00:10:31.422 --> 00:10:33.341
<i>You are all the same.</i>

100
00:10:37.511 --> 00:10:40.431
<i>All three of you
are full of love for each other.</i>

101
00:10:40.514 --> 00:10:42.141
<i>and so easy to manipulate.</i>

102
00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:51.942
<i>So far. everything has gone well.</i>

103
00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:54.487
<i>Now you have to take a gamble.
Yuji Itadori!</i>

104
00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:08.292
What a pity.

105
00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:12.129
<i>That was your last chance.</i>

106
00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:15.091
<i>Now you're the one with no escape.</i>

107
00:11:19.303 --> 00:11:20.137
<i>What?</i>

108
00:11:21.305 --> 00:11:23.432
<i>Convergence has been lifted?!</i>

109
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:28.354
<i>Blood Manipulation halts
the blood's coagulation</i>

110
00:11:28.437 --> 00:11:32.233
<i>to increase the technique's effectiveness.</i>

111
00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:38.239
<i>Therefore. Choso's blood dissolves
in water more easily than others'.</i>

112
00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:42.243
<i>In addition. the blood
that comes into contact with water</i>

113
00:11:42.326 --> 00:11:44.829
<i>is now under osmotic pressure.</i>

114
00:11:44.912 --> 00:11:47.456
<i>The red blood cells swell
and the cell membranes begin to tear.</i>

115
00:11:48.499 --> 00:11:54.839
<i>The blood cells that account for about 45%
of blood become uncontrollable.</i>

116
00:11:54.922 --> 00:11:57.258
<i>That's why Convergence has been lifted.</i>

117
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.636
<i>Mechamaru's plan was right.</i>

118
00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:07.768
<i>Now. Choso can no longer control
the blood outside his body.</i>

119
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.862
<i>Flowing Red Scale. Stack.</i>

120
00:12:17.945 --> 00:12:20.698
<i>Choso's combat experience was not enough.</i>

121
00:12:20.781 --> 00:12:23.784
<i>He didn't understand
what was happening to him.</i>

122
00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:29.623
<i>He just accepted reality keeping his cool.
and manipulated the blood inside his body.</i>

123
00:12:31.375 --> 00:12:33.419
<i>I don't know about the logic.</i>

124
00:12:33.502 --> 00:12:35.963
<i>I didn't have time to ask him either.</i>

125
00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:38.382
<i>But I'm sure about one thing...</i>

126
00:12:39.383 --> 00:12:41.385
<i>I have control here now.</i>

127
00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:51.330
<i>I can win.</i>

128
00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:55.834
<i>Just when he thought he was bound to win...</i>

129
00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:58.212
<i>The blood Choso condensed to its limit</i>

130
00:13:58.295 --> 00:14:01.799
<i>while making sure
it was not exposed to water.</i>

131
00:14:01.882 --> 00:14:04.635
<i>and reinforced by cursed energy...</i>

132
00:14:06.929 --> 00:14:11.183
<i>pierced Yuji Itadori's liver.</i>

133
00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:16.272
<i>Blood Manipulation. Blood Meteorite.</i>

134
00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:19.149
<i>I was too careless. I thought
he had no other long-range attacks.</i>

135
00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:21.861
<i>What is it? Where was I hit?</i>

136
00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:24.947
<i>This is different from the last time
I got pierced in the stomach.</i>

137
00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:27.700
<i>A vital part is injured.</i>

138
00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:29.285
<i>I'll lose.</i>

139
00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:30.870
<i>I'll die...</i>

140
00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:40.379
<i>I understand my duty now.</i>

141
00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:46.635
<i>To enable Fushiguro. Kugisaki.
Nanamin. and the other seniors</i>

142
00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:50.556
<i>to pass through here and get to Mr. Gojo.</i>

143
00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:53.642
<i>I'll take him down even if it means dying.</i>

144
00:14:54.643 --> 00:14:56.645
<i>I don't need to be the one</i>

145
00:14:57.229 --> 00:14:58.898
<i>to save Mr. Gojo.</i>

146
00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:03.652
<i>Three times. only three times.</i>

147
00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:06.238
<i>Except for the attacks I blocked.</i>

148
00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:10.659
<i>Itadori only hit me three times.
yet they've caused this much damage.</i>

149
00:15:11.827 --> 00:15:13.746
<i>Blood Meteorite is just hard.</i>

150
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:16.665
<i>It isn't comparable to Piercing Blood
in terms of speed and power.</i>

151
00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:20.920
<i>I probably couldn't have pierced him
if I hadn't caught him off guard.</i>

152
00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:27.426
<i>Blood Manipulation doesn't usually
solidify blood like with Blood Meteorite.</i>

153
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:29.637
<i>Blood Edge shapes the blood.</i>

154
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.933
<i>and increases lethality
by rotating it at a high speed.</i>

155
00:15:34.516 --> 00:15:36.769
<i>Even those sorcerers of Blood Manipulation</i>

156
00:15:36.852 --> 00:15:40.022
<i>are not able to extend
their consciousness to all blood vessels.</i>

157
00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.900
<i>In solidifying the blood.</i>

158
00:15:42.983 --> 00:15:47.029
<i>one is at risk
of suddenly developing thrombosis.</i>

159
00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:48.614
Come on.

160
00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:54.370
<i>Choso deems that
the risk Yuji Itadori brings</i>

161
00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:56.789
<i>greatly outweighs that.</i>

162
00:16:33.617 --> 00:16:34.535
<i>A tooth?</i>

163
00:16:38.247 --> 00:16:39.790
<i>It was a feint.</i>

164
00:17:48.609 --> 00:17:49.526
<i>It's not over yet.</i>

165
00:17:53.113 --> 00:17:56.033
<i>I haven't thrown a left-handed punch
since the first one.</i>

166
00:17:57.743 --> 00:18:00.287
<i>He probably thinks
that I can't use it anymore.</i>

167
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:03.749
<i>So I'll use my right hand
as a decoy to land...</i>

168
00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:08.212
<i>this hit!</i>

169
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:13.467
<i>What is this?</i>

170
00:18:13.967 --> 00:18:15.385
<i>The feeling of hitting him...</i>

171
00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:33.153
What a pity.

172
00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:52.131
You're still breathing?

173
00:19:02.015 --> 00:19:03.350
On the other side...

174
00:19:04.518 --> 00:19:06.895
go apologize to my brothers.

175
00:19:11.441 --> 00:19:12.401
<i>Boring.</i>

176
00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:16.321
How can you lose
