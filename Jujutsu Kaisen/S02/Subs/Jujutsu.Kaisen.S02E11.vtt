WEBVTT

00:15.250 --> 00:16.570
No good.

00:16.570 --> 00:18.150
It's not budging at all.

00:18.630 --> 00:21.790
W-Well, that was some decent force.

00:22.430 --> 00:24.030
<i>Is this guy for real?!</i>

00:24.030 --> 00:27.310
<i>He could give Nanami-san a run for 
his money in terms of physical blows.</i>

00:27.310 --> 00:29.540
<i>Though I suppose that's why...</i>

00:29.540 --> 00:32.260
It's a rather sturdy veil.

00:32.260 --> 00:34.530
We'll have to search for its weak point

00:34.530 --> 00:37.050
and put a hole in it, 
even if it's only for a second.

00:37.050 --> 00:39.850
We can't get anywhere 
without getting inside first.

00:40.670 --> 00:42.550
Huh? Why not?

00:42.550 --> 00:44.350
Why not?

00:44.350 --> 00:47.860
Listen, this is a veil to keep sorcerers out.

00:47.860 --> 00:50.190
It's a barrier.

00:50.190 --> 00:53.910
Barriers are all designed to surround
you and protect yourself, right?

00:53.910 --> 00:57.360
Which fundamentally means 
that whoever lowered this veil

00:57.360 --> 01:00.080
is inside it.

01:00.900 --> 01:03.990
But back in Harajuku...

01:07.790 --> 01:09.790
I see!

01:09.790 --> 01:13.580
So staying outside the veil instead of 
surrounding themselves with it increases

01:13.580 --> 01:15.790
the risk of being discovered and defeated,

01:15.790 --> 01:17.790
thereby raising the strength of the veil.

01:18.530 --> 01:20.690
It's a real egg of Columbus idea.

01:20.690 --> 01:22.020
Egg?

01:22.020 --> 01:26.020
Though, man, they're completely ignoring 
the fundamentals of barriers!

01:26.020 --> 01:27.820
What a crazy idea!

01:28.160 --> 01:32.880
Now I can see why the barrier didn't 
break from Yuji's earlier blow.

01:32.880 --> 01:34.370
If that's the logic,

01:34.370 --> 01:38.090
the veil's source should be somewhere 
that really stands out, right?

01:38.390 --> 01:40.950
By increasing the risk of discovery,

01:40.950 --> 01:43.430
they're further increasing 
its strength, then?

01:44.990 --> 01:47.830
Somewhere that stands out?

01:49.460 --> 01:52.960
<b>22:01 Shibuya Central Tower</b>

01:54.300 --> 01:56.800
Think the sorcerers will realize it?

02:03.580 --> 02:07.550
This is the place that stands out 
the most within the veil, right?

02:07.550 --> 02:09.290
Probably.

02:09.290 --> 02:12.140
But even if they do realize it...

02:12.620 --> 02:13.890
Yeah.

02:14.610 --> 02:18.690
The lower floors are swarming 
with those transfigured humans.

02:19.520 --> 02:22.880
They won't be able to 
climb up here that fast.

02:27.610 --> 02:28.950
<i>Wires?!</i>

02:29.220 --> 02:30.600
These are great.

02:29.270 --> 02:31.480
These are great.

02:38.620 --> 02:43.930
<i>Do these bastards know 
about the entrusted veil?</i>

02:45.030 --> 02:47.390
<i>Good! Just as planned!</i>

02:48.010 --> 02:50.520
So this is the source of the veil?

02:50.520 --> 02:52.610
Yeah. According to Mei-san,

02:52.610 --> 02:55.620
it already has the barrier programmed in,

02:55.620 --> 02:59.480
and it just needs someone 
to pour cursed energy into it.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.610
Which means as long as we destroy those,

03:02.610 --> 03:05.490
we can ignore the curse users until later.

03:06.750 --> 03:08.830
<i>There were three of them?!</i>

03:09.700 --> 03:12.080
<i>The veil keeping sorcerers 
out is still active.</i>

03:12.080 --> 03:13.820
<i>Where are the remaining two?</i>

03:15.010 --> 03:16.210
With him?!

03:32.110 --> 03:34.110
Fushiguro! Dismiss Nue!

03:41.920 --> 03:43.190
Grandson.

03:43.670 --> 03:47.110
Yes, I know, Granny.

03:47.630 --> 03:50.560
I have some endearing underclassmen now,

03:50.560 --> 03:54.290
so it's time to earn some achievements here

03:54.660 --> 03:58.280
so I can become a first-grade, too.

04:02.390 --> 04:03.390
Fushiguro!

04:04.630 --> 04:05.750
Where is he?!

04:05.750 --> 04:07.130
Right there.

04:09.110 --> 04:11.460
I didn't see the moment of impact.

04:12.780 --> 04:14.500
His body is too clean.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.310
Even if he is a sorcerer,

04:17.310 --> 04:20.310
he plummeted from the 41st floor.

04:20.310 --> 04:23.310
Get up, you old trickster!

04:28.560 --> 04:30.040
Good grief.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.510
Youngsters these days have 
no pity for the elderly.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.910
We can't waste time here.

04:39.910 --> 04:41.610

06:17.950 --> 06:21.270
Why are you so insistent 
on my recommendation?

06:21.700 --> 06:25.780
You could easily become 
semi-first-grade with your technique.

06:26.500 --> 06:30.050
Because I believe it's important 
to do things the right way.

06:30.450 --> 06:34.030
Especially with bloody 
work like being a sorcerer.

06:34.540 --> 06:39.540
But I'm not that bright, so sometimes 
I don't know what the right way is.

06:41.010 --> 06:43.900
So whenever I'm at a loss, I think to myself,

06:45.180 --> 06:47.360
"What would Nanami-san do?"

06:48.040 --> 06:52.250
So it wouldn't be right to become 
a first-grade without your approval.

07:43.260 --> 07:47.020

<i>My technique is Inverse.</i>

19:15.820 --> 19:17.370
<i>While activated,</i>

19:17.370 --> 19:19.980
<i>attacks that hit me are made 
weaker the stronger they are,</i>

19:19.980 --> 19:22.300
<i>and the weaker they are, 
the stronger they become.</i>

19:22.860 --> 19:28.280
<i>Not one person has ever managed to dodge my 
counter after landing their finishing blow.</i>

19:28.280 --> 19:33.310
<i>The more serious you two get, 
the less chance you have against me!</i>

19:44.400 --> 19:46.280
I've figured out his technique.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.790
It's probably Inverse.

19:49.990 --> 19:54.250
The attack I threw out of sync 
landed more effectively than your own.

19:55.140 --> 19:57.020
Fleeing Hares isn't meant for offense,

19:57.020 --> 19:59.800
but he didn't try to immediately 
break through once he was surrounded.

19:59.800 --> 20:04.680
I think that's also how he managed to stay 
perfectly fine after slamming into the ground.

20:05.340 --> 20:07.820
So we can defeat him with a forehead flick?

20:07.820 --> 20:10.440
No, the attack can't be too weak.

20:10.700 --> 20:12.200
If were just a pure inversion of force,

20:12.200 --> 20:16.350
activating it would kill himself 
with the minor force of air resistance.

20:16.070 --> 20:17.020
True.

20:17.740 --> 20:19.630
Since that doesn't happen,

20:19.630 --> 20:22.450
there must be an upper and 
a lower limit to his inversion.

20:22.450 --> 20:24.400
Even with it activated,

20:24.400 --> 20:27.620
he was still matching our attacks and 
using cursed energy to defend from slashes

20:27.620 --> 20:29.620
and the effects of our techniques, right?

20:29.620 --> 20:31.080
Makes sense.

20:31.710 --> 20:35.020
That also explains why he can't beat 
an anomaly like Gojo-sensei,

20:35.020 --> 20:38.080
and his technique's probably a bad 
match against complex techniques, too.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.980
Which means we need to strike together.

20:40.980 --> 20:45.700
Hit him with a powerful attack and a 
somewhat weak attack at the same time!

20:46.470 --> 20:47.270
Yeah.

20:47.270 --> 20:50.360
But we don't want him to realize 
we've figured out his technique.

20:50.880 --> 20:55.110
So we'll keep going at full power 
and make a show of our crazy strength.

21:00.930 --> 21:03.390
<i>We'll start with a weak blow from Gama.</i>

21:04.110 --> 21:06.800
<i>Then we pummel him with a rush.</i>

21:14.100 --> 21:15.310
<i>When...</i>

21:17.480 --> 21:19.120
<i>did they figure it out?!</i>

21:24.510 --> 21:25.760
<i>But still...</i>

21:26.640 --> 21:32.790
Don't get cocky over that, you brats!

21:54.560 --> 21:56.180
<i>He stopped it?!</i>

21:56.560 --> 22:00.670
<i>He killed his momentum for just a momentâ€”</i>

22:06.270 --> 22:08.520
You're surprisingly adept.

22:08.520 --> 22:10.010
Really?

23:40.850 --> 23:44.480
So, did you hear that the Gojos' 
little Satoru-kun was sealed?!

23:44.480 --> 23:45.290
Huh? Oh, yes.

23:45.290 --> 23:46.180
Ah, not interested?

23:46.180 --> 23:47.070
Hey, you!

23:47.070 --> 23:48.980
We heard this gossip from Geto-san there!

23:48.980 --> 23:51.290
Oh, heavens me! How could I? 
Please do forgive me!

23:51.290 --> 23:52.600
Next time, "Blunt Knife."

23:51.360 --> 23:55.030
