00:00:01.876 --> 00:00:08.008
{\an8}SHOTO BUNKAMURA STREET
OUTSIDE THE CURTAIN

2
00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:13.972
No. Ms. Kugisaki.

3
00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:16.891
Mr. Nanami said so too.

4
00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:20.395
And the reason I didn't tell you
about Miss Ieiri was...

5
00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:23.898
To prevent me from
taking such reckless actions. right?

6
00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:28.319
That's also why they came so late.

7
00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:31.406
Even so...

8
00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:36.578
I can't leave while
they are still fighting.

9
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:37.912
Wait!

10
00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:39.831
Ms. Kugisaki!

11
00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:43.913
Maybe I should have asked
Dagon to leave more humans.

12
00:02:46.457 --> 00:02:48.376
Never mind. it's enough.

13
00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:52.297
<i>Damn it.</i>

14
00:03:00.054 --> 00:03:01.389
Are you okay?

15
00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:13.985
<i>Damn.</i>

16
00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:53.024
Not bad.

17
00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.623
<i>As she avoided my hands.</i>

18
00:04:09.123 --> 00:04:12.168
<i>she probably got the report
from 7:3 Hairstyle Sorcerer.</i>

19
00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:13.878
You are so cold.

20
00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:25.765
<i>But I'm a clone.</i>

21
00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:29.936
<i>I can change my own shape.</i>

22
00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:32.480
<i>but I can't control transfigured humans</i>

23
00:04:32.563 --> 00:04:34.816
<i>or interfere with others' souls.</i>

24
00:04:39.028 --> 00:04:42.490
<i>She actually helped me greatly
by wearing down her own spirit.</i>

25
00:04:44.575 --> 00:04:48.121
Didn't I tell you? This won't work on me.

26
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.914
You know it. right?

27
00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.877
Sometimes. even if you know it.
you still have to do it.

28
00:04:55.586 --> 00:04:57.505
STUPID

29
00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:02.719
Take this.

30
00:05:04.762 --> 00:05:06.097
Hairpin.

31
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.557
<i>She jumped down.</i>

32
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.100
<i>What is she doing?</i>

33
00:05:09.183 --> 00:05:10.601
Another one.

34
00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:15.356
Hairpin.

35
00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.735
<i>The nails on the ground...</i>

36
00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.281
I've been thinking

37
00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:27.243
ever since I heard about your technique.

38
00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.996
This should work on you.

39
00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:33.207
Resonance!

40
00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.260
Kugisaki...

41
00:05:47.346 --> 00:05:50.600
<i>No way!</i>

42
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.352
<i>My opponent</i>

43
00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:57.023
<i>turns out to be not just Yuji Itadori.</i>

44
00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:01.444
Strange.

45
00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:06.532
Why do I feel my Cursed Energy
has erupted not far away?

46
00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:09.619
And your Cursed Energy
isn't strong enough.

47
00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:13.372
You could've touched me forcibly just now.

48
00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:14.540
Hey. you.

49
00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:18.544
A clone can't use any techniques.

50
00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:21.422
You are right.

51
00:06:34.435 --> 00:06:36.312
The impact of the technique lingers.

52
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.484
I can't move freely yet.

53
00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:48.699
<i>Kugisaki.</i>

54
00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:51.452
<i>Thank you.</i>

55
00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:57.333
<i>I couldn't save anyone.</i>

56
00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:00.336
<i>and everyone's effort was wasted.</i>

57
00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:02.588
<i>Even so...</i>

58
00:07:05.466 --> 00:07:08.845
<i>Thankfully. you made me
realize I'm not alone.</i>

59
00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:10.346
So...

60
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:12.849
Right here.

61
00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.103
I want to...

62
00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:19.772
kill you!

63
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.692
<i>Since "Resonance" can harm him.</i>

64
00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:26.070
<i>he won't launch continuous attacks
as he did just now.</i>

65
00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:28.823
The real show is about to begin.

66
00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.120
No.

67
00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:37.248
I will leave!

68
00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:39.750
What?

69
00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:41.252
Stop!

70
00:07:42.044 --> 00:07:45.006
<i>Although I could ignore him and head
straight to the fifth floor underground.</i>

71
00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:49.010
<i>if I let him be. there'll be more trouble.</i>

72
00:07:57.059 --> 00:07:58.102
<i>Going down?</i>

73
00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:00.521
<i>Good. I'll exorcise him first.</i>

74
00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.857
<i>then head directly to
the fifth floor underground.</i>

75
00:08:09.113 --> 00:08:10.281
<i>He split up.</i>

76
00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:12.283
<i>Which one?</i>

77
00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:14.785
<i>One of the clones</i>

78
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:18.539
<i>must contain
the critical part of the soul.</i>

79
00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:23.628
He took the bait.

80
00:08:24.128 --> 00:08:26.047
<i>Damn. I was tricked by the Cursed Energy.</i>

81
00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:36.474
<i>There are two Mahitos?</i>

82
00:08:37.141 --> 00:08:40.186
<i>Did he create clones and act separately?</i>

83
00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:42.813
<i>Now he wants to unite to heal himself?</i>

84
00:08:51.155 --> 00:08:52.365
<i>What...</i>

85
00:08:59.121 --> 00:09:00.164
Itadori?

86
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.963
Run. Kugisaki!

87
00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:15.846
Nice shot.

88
00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.100
Don't get in the way!

89
00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:21.227
Kugisaki!

90
00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:24.730
<i>So...</i>

91
00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:29.151
<i>I only touched 7:3 Hairstyle Sorcerer once
and couldn't completely get rid of him.</i>

92
00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:32.321
<i>What about her?</i>

93
00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:47.003
YEAR 2009

94
00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:56.512
Heck. take this!

95
00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.224
Nobara. that won't do.

96
00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:02.727
You need to stop your opponents
from returning to the field.

97
00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:06.272
<i>At that time...</i>

98
00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:08.274
Come on.

99
00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:12.278
<i>I thought everyone in the village was mad.</i>

100
00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:17.283
<i>and I was the only normal person.</i>

101
00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:31.339
You have to use the school bag
until sixth grade.

102
00:10:31.422 --> 00:10:32.923
Are you sure you want this one?

103
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.011
<i>Although Mother tried to persuade me.</i>

104
00:10:37.094 --> 00:10:39.972
<i>I still chose the water-blue school bag.</i>

105
00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:42.391
<i>When I was about to start
elementary school.</i>

106
00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:44.268
<i>our whole family moved to this village.</i>

107
00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:48.397
<i>My parents were concerned about
the inconvenience of rural life.</i>

108
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.859
<i>but I just didn't want to be
separated from my friends.</i>

109
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.489
<i>There were only 19 students
in the entire school.</i>

110
00:10:56.989 --> 00:10:58.324
<i>not 19 ones in a class.</i>

111
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.994
<i>Everyone carried a red
or black school bag.</i>

112
00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:05.206
<i>I also liked the red or black one.</i>

113
00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:08.751
<i>but it seemed everyone
hated the water-blue one.</i>

114
00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:12.004
CLEANING DUTY LIST

115
00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:54.130
Thank you.

116
00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:58.050
Fumi.

117
00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:01.262
Give me your school bag. let's swap.

118
00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:06.392
Swap with me.

119
00:12:08.644 --> 00:12:11.564
Watch this!

120
00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:22.408
Number one in Japan!

121
00:12:23.325 --> 00:12:26.328
-Hey you. Kugisaki!
-Oh no.

122
00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:29.540
Kugisaki. it's you again?

123
00:12:29.623 --> 00:12:33.961
So noisy. old man. don't come here!

124
00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:39.341
<i>She returned my school bag
to me on the same day.</i>

125
00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:41.927
I hate carrying a school bag.

126
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.475
<i>Since that day.
Nobara has often stayed in my house</i>

127
00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:50.102
<i>to play video games with my father.</i>

128
00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:53.189
Your gliding skill has improved.

129
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.860
<i>Nobara didn't like
the people in the village.</i>

130
00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:01.363
Because the village is too small.

131
00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:05.868
being strangers is even
harder than being friends.

132
00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:11.707
<i>At that time. I thought it was great.</i>

133
00:13:13.542 --> 00:13:14.793
A few years later.

134
00:13:14.877 --> 00:13:18.380
<i>when an old lady nearby
brought me a bowl of red bean rice.</i>

135
00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:23.469
<i>I understood what Nobara said.
It does make people uncomfortable.</i>

136
00:13:27.014 --> 00:13:28.140
Fumi.

137
00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:31.227
I found a secret base.

138
00:13:36.732 --> 00:13:40.027
<i>Nobara would say things
that children don't usually say.</i>

139
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.321
<i>But sometimes she said
something like this too.</i>

140
00:13:42.863 --> 00:13:45.366
From today on. I'm going to live there.

141
00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:49.703
<i>Looking back now.
she must have learned it from someone.</i>

142
00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:51.872
<i>Her mother. for example.</i>

143
00:13:56.126 --> 00:13:57.336
Here.

144
00:13:59.129 --> 00:14:02.716
<i>The secret base Nobara talked about
was actually someone else's house.</i>

145
00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:06.637
You really came.

146
00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.683
Come in. it's cold outside.

147
00:14:13.143 --> 00:14:15.521
<i>The girl's name is Saori.</i>

148
00:14:15.604 --> 00:14:18.399
<i>She moved to this village
later than I did.</i>

149
00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:27.908
<i>We would always drop by unexpectedly.</i>

150
00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:30.911
<i>But she always welcomed us graciously.
never showing any signs of annoyance.</i>

151
00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:35.708
<i>Come to think of it.
Saori always stayed at home.</i>

152
00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:39.837
<i>Ever since we met Saori. Nobara changed.</i>

153
00:14:40.337 --> 00:14:43.340
Yes. that's right.

154
00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:45.342
Your talk like Matsuko.

155
00:14:46.051 --> 00:14:48.637
Fumi. let me practice braiding pigtails.

156
00:14:49.471 --> 00:14:50.764
Again?

157
00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:54.310
<i>Her tone of speech became softer.</i>

158
00:14:54.393 --> 00:14:55.811
<i>How should I put it?</i>

159
00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:58.939
<i>It's as if she has become more elegant.</i>

160
00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:03.027
<i>Though we were both outsiders.</i>

161
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.530
<i>I felt so much inferior
to Saori in every aspect.</i>

162
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:14.955
{\an8}<i>After a while.
things at Saori's home started to be off.</i>

163
00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:16.957
{\an8}GET LOST!
JUST DISAPPEAR!

164
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:21.962
<i>There was trash. graffiti.
and deliberately accumulated snow.</i>

165
00:15:22.546 --> 00:15:26.091
<i>That made the grand house
look frightening.</i>

166
00:15:35.476 --> 00:15:37.895
<i>And not long after that.</i>

167
00:15:39.563 --> 00:15:41.649
<i>Saori moved away.</i>

168
00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:45.861
<i>Nobara and I went to say goodbye to her.</i>

169
00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:52.242
<i>I can no longer remember
what was said or how the weather was.</i>

170
00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:54.995
<i>All I remember is</i>

171
00:15:55.829 --> 00:16:00.000
<i>Nobara's face covered in tears.</i>

172
00:16:01.835 --> 00:16:03.504
<i>I didn't know she could cry.</i>

173
00:16:04.088 --> 00:16:08.592
<i>Perhaps the shock of that is why
I can't remember anything else.</i>

174
00:16:16.767 --> 00:16:18.352
<i>This June.</i>

175
00:16:19.853 --> 00:16:23.440
<i>Nobara decided to go to Tokyo
for high school.</i>

176
00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.030
<i>It seemed that she chose to leave
at this awkward time</i>

177
00:16:30.114 --> 00:16:32.449
<i>because of a fight with her grandma.</i>

178
00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:36.745
I'm leaving. I will never return here.

179
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:39.915
Fumi. you should also leave this village.

180
00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.002
Right.

181
00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:46.380
<i>You aren't crying when you're leaving me.</i>

182
00:16:46.463 --> 00:16:49.216
<i>Such a terrible idea
flashed through my mind.</i>

183
00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:51.385
<i>It left me speechless.</i>

184
00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:56.181
<i>After that day.
we never mentioned Saori again.</i>

185
00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:01.020
Fumi.

186
00:17:02.396 --> 00:17:04.648
The next time we meet.
it'll be the three of us.

187
00:17:29.339 --> 00:17:30.424
Yeah.

188
00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:49.985
Saori. do you want to take a break?

189
00:17:53.781 --> 00:17:56.825
No. I need to finish
the proofreading today.

190
00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:59.453
No. I think it's yesterday.

191
00:18:00.287 --> 00:18:02.206
It's still today before sunrise.

192
00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:18.305
I have a pimple.

193
00:18:19.014 --> 00:18:21.683
Something is wrong in Shibuya.
Is it a terrorist attack?

194
00:18:23.894 --> 00:18:27.231
Ma'am. do you plan to get married?

195
00:18:29.316 --> 00:18:30.526
Why do you ask?

196
00:18:32.402 --> 00:18:35.114
I just think it shouldn't
have been like this.

197
00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:39.243
I moved to a super rural place
when I was in the eighth grade.

198
00:18:39.326 --> 00:18:40.369
Parents' job transfer?

199
00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:42.955
No. because my mom is a crazy woman

200
00:18:43.038 --> 00:18:45.207
obsessed with organic food
and spiritual enlightenment.

201
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:47.334
I see.

202
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:54.091
I met two girls there who were
seven years younger than me.

203
00:18:54.174 --> 00:18:58.011
The girl named Nobara
was very clingy towards me.

204
00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:02.599
Because I'm an only child.

205
00:19:02.683 --> 00:19:05.978
I thought she was so cute.

206
00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:09.189
So I acted like a big sister.
hoping she would look up to me.

207
00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:16.864
I would serve them black tea.

208
00:19:18.365 --> 00:19:20.450
They were only in the first grade then.

209
00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:22.744
That's cute.

210
00:19:26.582 --> 00:19:29.585
I didn't exchange
contact information with her

211
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:33.505
because I was afraid
we would gradually drift apart.

212
00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:39.219
She even cried when I left the village.

213
00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:41.805
But...

214
00:19:42.306 --> 00:19:46.643
If she sees how ordinary I am now.
she'll probably be very disappointed.

215
00:19:51.273 --> 00:19:53.358
I wonder how Nobara is doing.

216
00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:56.820
<i>What is she doing now and where is she?</i>

217
00:20:04.828 --> 00:20:08.624
<i>Everyone in the village was mad.</i>

218
00:20:09.499 --> 00:20:11.251
<i>But that wasn't really the case.</i>

219
00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:14.504
It's just that those with issues
were particularly loud.

220
00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:17.799
<i>It made me think that everyone but me</i>

221
00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:21.470
<i>would mindlessly trample
upon others' lives.</i>

222
00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:32.105
But that's not necessarily true.

223
00:20:54.878 --> 00:20:56.213
<i>Sorry. Fumi.</i>

224
00:21:00.717 --> 00:21:03.553
<i>I couldn't keep our promise.</i>

225
00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:13.105
Itadori. tell everyone this for me.

226
00:21:15.857 --> 00:21:17.526
"I've had a pretty good life."

227
00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:44.803
<i>Kugisaki.</i>

228
00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.897
<i>The first time I got off at Tokyo Station.</i>

229
00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:23.235
<i>I was put off by the atmosphere where
I was forced to stand behind a truck.</i>

230
00:23:23.318 --> 00:23:25.779
<i>Now I don't mind at all.</i>

231
00:23:25.862 --> 00:23:27.906
<i>Next episode: Right and Wrong. Part 3.</i>

232
00:23:27.989 --> 00:23:30.325
<i>Life is more interesting with some stains.</i>
