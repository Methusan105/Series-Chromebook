1
00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:10.176
Sister!

2
00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:17.976
Three. two. one.

3
00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:28.236
So narrow.

4
00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:32.407
I see.

5
00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:43.918
<i>First. put the target in the coffin.</i>

6
00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.963
<i>Second. bury it under the gravestone.</i>

7
00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.383
<i>Third. start the count of three seconds.</i>

8
00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:54.054
<i>These are guaranteed to hit
in this domain.</i>

9
00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:56.806
<i>Considering that it's
a disease cursed spirit.</i>

10
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.810
<i>if I can't get out of the coffin
within three seconds.</i>

11
00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:04.481
<i>I will be infected by the disease and die.</i>

12
00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.080
<i>The problem is that gravestone.</i>

13
00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.626
<i>If I get hit two more times.
I won't be able to maintain my agility.</i>

14
00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:28.129
<i>I wouldn't want to fight Geto
in that state.</i>

15
00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:30.757
Ui Ui. are you okay?

16
00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:33.092
Yes. Sister.

17
00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:37.931
It's reflexively targeting

18
00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:41.601
the person with the strongest
cursed energy in the domain.

19
00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:47.190
{\an8}Two crows got caught inside the domain.

20
00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.042
Just as I thought.

21
00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:08.545
<i>To put that into a corner.</i>

22
00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:11.548
<i>I have to make Ui Ui the target.</i>

23
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:15.051
<i>and buy time for me to move freely.</i>

24
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.306
<i>But Ui Ui would die
with a single hit by the gravestone.</i>

25
00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:24.394
Ui Ui.

26
00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.815
would you die for me?

27
00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:36.114
Do I have the honor to die for you?

28
00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:58.136
<i>When I released my cursed energy.</i>

29
00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.388
<i>Sister suppressed hers.</i>

30
00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:04.017
<i>I understand everything now. Sister.</i>

31
00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:29.250
You think I had that kid here
just to help me carry things?

32
00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:33.796
<i>When my sister asked me to risk my life.</i>

33
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.507
{\an8}<i>that means I can use my cursed technique.</i>

34
00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:37.800
{\an8}NEW SHADOW STYLE. SIMPLE DOMAIN

35
00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:41.179
Ui Ui is responsible
for dealing with domains.

36
00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:45.308
I don't like to owe others favors.

37
00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:47.894
So I leave this part to that kid.

38
00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:31.854
What do you think is the fastest way

39
00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.606
to improve sorcerers' abilities?

40
00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:37.068
{\an8}That would be a Binding Vow.
for which you'd risk your life.

41
00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:39.654
Am I right. Sister?

42
00:04:39.737 --> 00:04:40.571
<i>That's right.</i>

43
00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:43.533
<i>Her cursed technique is
Black Bird Manipulation.</i>

44
00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:46.327
and its true value is Bird Strike.

45
00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:50.456
<i>It forces a crow to commit suicide.
and as the trade-off.</i>

46
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.751
<i>it lifts the cursed energy limit
of a typically weak animal.</i>

47
00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:54.961
<i>and hit the enemy with it.</i>

48
00:04:55.628 --> 00:05:01.551
<i>The only human who could block
Bird Strike was Satoru Gojo.</i>

49
00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:12.729
Okay. everyone. we're at the main base.

50
00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.942
Are you willing to die for me?

51
00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:23.906
You're quite skilled
for a sorcerer of this time.

52
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.586
Satoru Gojo was sealed?

53
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.672
This is simply incomprehensible.

54
00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:05.424
{\an8}I think so too. but...

55
00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:08.636
{\an8}Geto has his part in it.
even though he's a fake.

56
00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:11.139
{\an8}That might explain it.

57
00:07:12.014 --> 00:07:17.353
{\an8}I'd like to enjoy the downfall
of the Gojo Family though.

58
00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:22.066
{\an8}Leave if you don't want to work seriously.

59
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.652
{\an8}Are you telling me to go back?

60
00:07:24.735 --> 00:07:27.572
{\an8}You're the one who should go back. Maki.

61
00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:31.075
{\an8}Isn't that right. Grade 1 sorcerer Nanami?

62
00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:32.243
Maki.

63
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:36.289
You should do what Naobito said
just for this once.

64
00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:38.833
I'm more useful than a drunkard.

65
00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:39.834
{\an8}22:20 SHIBUYA STATION

66
00:07:39.917 --> 00:07:41.752
{\an8}Have you been drinking?

67
00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:43.087
{\an8}No.

68
00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:49.802
{\an8}<i>Should I have acted alone?</i>

69
00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:02.815
Mr. Nanami.

70
00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:03.733
Right.

71
00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:12.742
Leave it to me.

72
00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:23.628
You two.

73
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.049
Aren't you too slow?

74
00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:38.100
Did you see what happened?

75
00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:39.644
No.

76
00:08:40.394 --> 00:08:42.647
{\an8}<i>That was a cursed technique. wasn't it?</i>

77
00:08:58.996 --> 00:09:00.081
You little...

78
00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:03.376
How many people did you eat?

79
00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:11.300
Jogo.

80
00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:17.890
Mahito.

81
00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.143
Hanami.

82
00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:24.480
Hana...

83
00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:27.900
mi...

84
00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:31.070
How dare...

85
00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:34.532
How dare you kill Hanami!

86
00:09:34.615 --> 00:09:36.701
You killed Hanami!

87
00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:40.955
I see. No wonder it was so weak.

88
00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:46.794
Until just now.
it was only a Cursed Womb.

89
00:09:54.218 --> 00:09:55.386
Water!

90
00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:07.732
So much water here.

91
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:14.405
Hey. cursed spirit.

92
00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:21.120
do you know how many frames there are
in every second of an animation?

93
00:10:21.203 --> 00:10:23.956
My name is not "cursed spirit." I'm Dagon.

94
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.544
Recently. there's been a trend
of increasing resolution and frame rate...

95
00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:32.465
Hanami. Jogo. and Mahito.

96
00:10:32.548 --> 00:10:37.970
Up-convert to make this 4K.
make that 60 fps for frame interpolation...

97
00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:39.555
We all have...

98
00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:43.851
It's fine if it's for personal enjoyment
and doesn't cause trouble for others.

99
00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:50.232
But nowadays. TVs automatically enable
the motion interpolation feature.

100
00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:55.321
People don't understand
it's too much of a good thing.

101
00:10:55.404 --> 00:10:57.865
How sad.

102
00:10:57.948 --> 00:10:59.367
With the soap opera effect...

103
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.952
We all have names!

104
00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:05.539
{\an8}Don't you find it tactless?

105
00:11:20.596 --> 00:11:21.889
Oops.

106
00:11:41.575 --> 00:11:43.411
<i>Not a scratch.</i>

107
00:11:43.494 --> 00:11:47.164
<i>Rather. from the feeling of hitting it.
his HP seems endless.</i>

108
00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:03.222
Two Grade 1 sorcerers are
not enough to exorcise it?

109
00:12:03.305 --> 00:12:05.307
This is getting serious.

110
00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:07.017
<i>Damn it.</i>

111
00:12:07.101 --> 00:12:11.730
<i>If it weren't for the old man's technique.
I would have been killed.</i>

112
00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:14.066
<i>How humiliating.</i>

113
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.569
{\an8}A water barrier?

114
00:12:16.652 --> 00:12:19.238
{\an8}Can you use strong attacks simultaneously?

115
00:12:19.738 --> 00:12:23.826
{\an8}Too much cursed energy.
Seems it has many other cursed techniques.

116
00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:25.703
What should we do now?

117
00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:28.664
The answer is simple.

118
00:12:28.747 --> 00:12:30.666
Before it can use your technique...

119
00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:34.670
<i>just crush it with speed!</i>

120
00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:39.758
<i>No way.</i>

121
00:12:48.225 --> 00:12:50.895
<i>You can even suspend in the air.</i>

122
00:12:50.978 --> 00:12:53.314
<i>I would also choose to flee up high.</i>

123
00:12:57.568 --> 00:12:59.737
<i>I can't activate the cursed technique.</i>

124
00:13:07.369 --> 00:13:09.121
<i>This man...</i>

125
00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:11.832
<i>This man did it.</i>

126
00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:25.346
<i>So fast! He's probably
even faster than Jogo.</i>

127
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.857
<i>Naobito Zenin's technique.
Projection Sorcery.</i>

128
00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:39.401
<i>It divides a second into 24 frames</i>

129
00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:41.487
<i>and using his own field of view
as the angle of view.</i>

130
00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:45.658
<i>he traces predetermined movements.</i>

131
00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:50.454
<i>During the technique activation.
anyone touched by Naobito's palm</i>

132
00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:54.917
<i>must also follow
the 1/24 fps rule to move.</i>

133
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.421
<i>If they fail. it will cause instability
and they will freeze for one second.</i>

134
00:14:03.133 --> 00:14:04.468
<i>There is a risk.</i>

135
00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:09.223
<i>He cannot adjust
the ongoing actions once started</i>

136
00:14:09.306 --> 00:14:13.143
{\an8}<i>If the actions he set
violate the laws of physics or trajectory.</i>

137
00:14:13.227 --> 00:14:16.188
{\an8}<i>he will freeze too.</i>

138
00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:31.787
<i>Even so. with his innate sense
of storyboarding and timing.</i>

139
00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:37.459
<i>he became known as the fastest sorcerer
excluding Satoru Gojo.</i>

140
00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:43.382
Don't even try.

141
00:15:15.372 --> 00:15:17.291
Domain Expansion.

142
00:15:22.379 --> 00:15:24.548
Horizon of the Captivating Skandha.

143
00:15:28.677 --> 00:15:31.513
<i>Shikigami!
It's the guaranteed hit in this domain!</i>

144
00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:33.057
<i>I didn't even notice until I was hit.</i>

145
00:15:33.724 --> 00:15:36.977
<i>No. that thing didn't exist
before hitting me?</i>

146
00:15:38.687 --> 00:15:40.731
Secret Art: Falling Blossom Emotion.

147
00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:44.693
<i>The technique passed down
in the Big Three Sorcerer Families.</i>

148
00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:48.739
<i>Different from Simple Domain.
it does not expand its own domain.</i>

149
00:15:48.822 --> 00:15:51.700
<i>When a guaranteed hit is activated
and comes into contact.</i>

150
00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:55.537
<i>it counter-attacks releasing cursed energy
to protect the user.</i>

151
00:15:56.372 --> 00:16:00.751
<i>That man really is different.
I've had a rough grasp.</i>

152
00:16:00.834 --> 00:16:05.464
<i>I'll use 70% of my power for
the bearded man and 30% for the suit guy.</i>

153
00:16:05.547 --> 00:16:09.802
Technique Release: Death Swarm!

154
00:16:14.723 --> 00:16:15.641
Maki.

155
00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:18.852
The Shikigami are not
charging straight at us.

156
00:16:19.353 --> 00:16:23.273
At the next moment.
they will bite through our bodies.

157
00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:24.650
{\an8}We can't think before we act.

158
00:16:24.733 --> 00:16:28.529
{\an8}As soon as you feel a touch.
please knock them all down.

159
00:16:28.612 --> 00:16:31.490
{\an8}You have almost no cursed energy.
so you can only do it this way...

160
00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.161
Mr. Nanami!

161
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.173
{\an8}<i>The Shikigami's attack
has not weakened at all.</i>

162
00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:51.510
{\an8}<i>The technique granted
to this domain could be...</i>

163
00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:01.603
Falling...

164
00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:06.859
{\an8}The sea is the source of all life.

165
00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:13.657
Too weak. you're the weakest.

166
00:17:17.077 --> 00:17:22.082
Death Swarm is
an endless stream of Shikigami.

167
00:17:30.632 --> 00:17:32.801
Since I'm so weak.

168
00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:35.137
why didn't you kill me in one strike?

169
00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:38.015
Stinky octopus!

170
00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:42.311
Then just like the other two...

171
00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:43.979
Damn it.

172
00:17:45.147 --> 00:17:47.566
You'll be devoured too.

173
00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:54.323
Maki!

174
00:17:55.157 --> 00:17:56.784
Megumi!

175
00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:04.374
<i>You really are...</i>

176
00:18:06.835 --> 00:18:09.129
<i>an incredibly arrogant junior.</i>

177
00:18:09.963 --> 00:18:10.881
<i>It's that thing.</i>

178
00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:15.052
<i>That octopus is the owner of this domain.</i>

179
00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:19.807
<i>You invaded my domain voluntarily.</i>

180
00:18:21.975 --> 00:18:23.060
How foolish.

181
00:18:24.978 --> 00:18:26.230
What?

182
00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:45.999
<i>The guaranteed hit
in this domain is gone.</i>

183
00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:50.504
<i>That boy expanded a domain.</i>

184
00:18:50.587 --> 00:18:54.883
<i>Now we're in a domain tug of war.</i>

185
00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:57.386
<i>If I want to regain the guaranteed hit.</i>

186
00:18:57.469 --> 00:19:01.682
<i>I have to destroy his domain first.</i>

187
00:19:01.765 --> 00:19:03.350
That's easy.

188
00:19:24.913 --> 00:19:26.206
What about the other two?

189
00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:27.791
Ino was taken down by the enemy.

190
00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:29.418
Itadori and I split up.

191
00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:34.548
{\an8}I'll protect you.
Please focus on the domain.

192
00:19:37.634 --> 00:19:42.556
<i>That man actually withstood
one minute of Death Swarm?!</i>

193
00:19:44.141 --> 00:19:45.934
<i>The bearded man too!</i>

194
00:19:59.781 --> 00:20:02.367
Though it's just a right arm.

195
00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:06.997
it had a history of 71 years.

196
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.333
It'll cost you a lot.

197
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.760
<i>If we can maintain it.
we have a chance to win.</i>

198
00:20:21.094 --> 00:20:22.429
<i>If we can maintain it. that is.</i>

199
00:20:28.101 --> 00:20:29.269
Mr. Nanami.

200
00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:36.360
That octopus thinks
I am fighting against his domain.

201
00:20:36.443 --> 00:20:38.528
But I have a different purpose.

202
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.616
<i>I want to make a hole in the domain</i>

203
00:20:43.116 --> 00:20:45.035
<i>in this barrier.</i>

204
00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:48.956
{\an8}The hole I came through has been closed.

205
00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:50.791
{\an8}It's harder to make it from the inside.

206
00:20:50.874 --> 00:20:55.545
{\an8}but I can open a big enough hole
for a few seconds.

207
00:20:56.129 --> 00:20:57.756
After all. he's not Mr. Gojo.

208
00:20:57.839 --> 00:21:01.510
Probably he can't use domain expansion
multiple times in a day.

209
00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:04.554
If we all escape this domain. we can win.

210
00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:06.598
The edge of the barrier is under my feet.

211
00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:08.976
I touched it when I came in. so I know.

212
00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:12.312
I can start at any time.
You three just need to rush in together.

213
00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:16.984
{\an8}We can't leave you behind.

214
00:21:17.484 --> 00:21:19.236
{\an8}I will stake my life...

215
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.822
{\an8}but I don't intend to sacrifice it.

216
00:21:24.157 --> 00:21:26.285
You two...

217
00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:28.912
Gather!

218
00:21:35.002 --> 00:21:38.255
<i>They want to protect that boy together?</i>

219
00:21:38.338 --> 00:21:39.923
<i>It's easier for me to take them all at...</i>

220
00:21:42.259 --> 00:21:43.260
<i>No!</i>

221
00:21:43.343 --> 00:21:45.304
{\an8}<i>He noticed?! But it's too late.</i>

222
00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:47.889
To Fushiguro's feet!

223
00:23:36.623 --> 00:23:39.793
<i>Family structure affects your personality.
don't you think?</i>

224
00:23:39.876 --> 00:23:43.255
<i>Sister. you might reinforce the stereotype
that only children are selfish.</i>

225
00:23:43.338 --> 00:23:44.422
<i>That's not too good.</i>

226
00:23:44.506 --> 00:23:45.423
<i>You deny my sister?</i>

227
00:23:45.507 --> 00:23:46.341
<i>What?</i>

228
00:23:46.424 --> 00:23:47.551
<i>Next episode. Sway. Part 2.</i>

229
00:23:47.634 --> 00:23:48.802
<i>I wonder how many siblings
Satoru Gojo has.</i>

230
00:23:48.885 --> 00:23:50.971
<i>-He's definitely an only child.
-He's definitely an only child.</i>
