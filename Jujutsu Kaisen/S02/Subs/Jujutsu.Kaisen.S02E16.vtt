00:00:02.544 --> 00:00:04.504
<i>I knew.</i>

2
00:00:05.797 --> 00:00:08.550
<i>I knew it.</i>

3
00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:14.180
<i>But I didn't expect it to be this much.</i>

4
00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.947
<i>He has no cursed energy.
but he is so fast.</i>

5
00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:57.617
<i>This guy might amount to
the best version of Maki.</i>

6
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:00.328
<i>I need to concentrate.</i>

7
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:02.163
<i>Thanks to Inumaki.</i>

8
00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:04.332
<i>the ordinary people
and transfigured humans are gone.</i>

9
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.878
<i>I need to visualize
a scene where I defeat him.</i>

10
00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.589
<i>Visualize</i>

11
00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:13.424
<i>defeating him.</i>

12
00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:17.887
Rabbit Escape!

13
00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.267
<i>I felt the presence of Sukuna's fingers.</i>

14
00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:26.229
<i>What's happening in Shibuya right now?</i>

15
00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.197
<i>He dashed here based on his intuition!</i>

16
00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:46.040
<i>Damn.</i>

17
00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:48.668
{\an8}<i>The cursed energy I have left
is not enough to expand my domain.</i>

18
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.797
{\an8}23:01 SHIBUYA STREAM

19
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:36.549
Kusakabe.

20
00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.760
Haven't we checked
inside the building enough?

21
00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:41.221
I know it's inside the curtain.

22
00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:44.140
but thanks to Toge. most people
have already been evacuated.

23
00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.226
Let's go to Satoru.

24
00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:50.063
How can we get to the basement five?

25
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.859
Toge said that Satoru was really sealed.
We should hurry up.

26
00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:58.071
You have mentioned Gojo enough.

27
00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:02.242
It's not like
he's the only person in the world.

28
00:04:04.702 --> 00:04:06.329
<i>Right now.</i>

29
00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:10.166
<i>perhaps there's someone
trembling in a corner of Shibuya.</i>

30
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.128
<i>For example. a lower-grade
elementary school girl.</i>

31
00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:16.923
What if we couldn't find her?

32
00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:22.387
We are to blame
if she's deprived of her future.

33
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.722
I guess you're right.

34
00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:29.602
If you understand. check every building.
every floor. and even every toilet's lid.

35
00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:34.274
<i>Damn. I can't come up with more excuses.</i>

36
00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:37.694
<i>I am not going to the basement five.</i>

37
00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:40.488
<i>I just want to keep procrastinating.</i>

38
00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:43.533
<i>Why? Because I don't want to die.</i>

39
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.952
<i>If Panda finds out how to get there.</i>

40
00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:48.079
<i>he will rush to
the basement five alone.</i>

41
00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:49.455
<i>I want to avoid that too.</i>

42
00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.292
<i>Because I do not want
to be left alone here.</i>

43
00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:56.879
<i>He is a panda.
but he's more humane than me.</i>

44
00:04:56.963 --> 00:05:00.091
<i>But because he is a panda.
he is not familiar with Shibuya.</i>

45
00:05:00.174 --> 00:05:03.678
<i>He's totally unaware of how close
we are to the basement five.</i>

46
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:05.430
I'll take a look over there.

47
00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:08.224
Okay. check carefully.

48
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.602
<i>Next. I'll pretend to
be lost in the station.</i>

49
00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:13.438
<i>Not just those who sealed Gojo.</i>

50
00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:16.190
<i>but I can also feel the huge cursed energy
appearing and disappearing.</i>

51
00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:19.360
I'm out. This is ridiculous.

52
00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:26.826
Are you Jujutsu sorcerers
from the high school?

53
00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:28.286
Surrender.

54
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.913
If possible.
I don't want to kill sorcerers.

55
00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:33.624
Panda.

56
00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:35.293
There are three people behind us.

57
00:05:35.376 --> 00:05:37.128
There might be more hiding.

58
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.090
I don't want to be killed either.

59
00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:44.302
But I can't just surrender either.

60
00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:46.512
Why don't you introduce yourselves?

61
00:05:47.096 --> 00:05:49.474
Take as much time as you want.

62
00:06:23.424 --> 00:06:25.093
<i>Dragging this out
will only disadvantage me.</i>

63
00:06:25.676 --> 00:06:28.054
<i>I have to finish it quickly.
and I have no other choice.</i>

64
00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:30.264
<i>My only advantage is...</i>

65
00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:33.392
{\an8}Principal. we have
cursed corpses here too.

66
00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:34.685
{\an8}I can stay here alone.

67
00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:36.312
{\an8}You can't.

68
00:06:36.395 --> 00:06:39.315
If the enemy finds this place.
you will become their primary target.

69
00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:41.609
You can heal others
with your Reverse Cursed Technique.

70
00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:43.528
Even Satoru can't do that.

71
00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:46.823
If you hadn't come.
Ino and Ijichi would have already died.

72
00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:49.700
That's thanks to your judgment.

73
00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:52.370
It would have been too late
if I had come after Nanami called.

74
00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:55.957
And it was significant
that we could let Nanami act freely.

75
00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:02.630
Didn't you quit smoking?

76
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.510
It's because I recalled something
from my student days.

77
00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:30.783
<i>Miss Ieiri is not far away.</i>

78
00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.369
<i>I must bear all the risks
of the battle by myself.</i>

79
00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:37.957
<i>I'll end this battle minimizing injuries
to get back to the battle line.</i>

80
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.670
<i>I limited his route.</i>

81
00:07:42.753 --> 00:07:45.131
<i>His speed is like that
of Sukuna back then.</i>

82
00:07:45.214 --> 00:07:46.299
<i>I can't rely on my eyes.</i>

83
00:07:46.382 --> 00:07:47.550
<i>And the timing...</i>

84
00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:50.178
<i>If I miss the timing. I will die.</i>

85
00:07:50.761 --> 00:07:52.472
<i>If I miss the timing.</i>

86
00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:56.184
<i>I will die.</i>

87
00:08:16.787 --> 00:08:17.955
<i>Damn it.</i>

88
00:08:22.084 --> 00:08:23.336
<i>My child...</i>

89
00:08:24.086 --> 00:08:26.339
He's definitely got it.

90
00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:29.967
When he reaches five or six.
and if he possesses cursed techniques.

91
00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:32.762
I can sell him to you.

92
00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:35.223
But of course. it depends on
how much you're willing to offer.

93
00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:37.850
If it's an inherited technique.
I'll charge eight.

94
00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:39.852
If something else. I'll charge seven.

95
00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:44.190
If it's an inherited technique.
I'll give you ten.

96
00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:49.946
<i>Even though that place is a dump to me.</i>

97
00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:52.782
<i>for someone with talent.
it shouldn't be that bad.</i>

98
00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:55.159
<i>It doesn't matter anymore.</i>

99
00:08:57.161 --> 00:08:58.663
{\an8}<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

100
00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.333
<i>I'll leave Megumi to you.</i>

101
00:09:07.004 --> 00:09:08.089
Hey.

102
00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:12.927
What's your name?

103
00:09:15.429 --> 00:09:16.764
Fushiguro.

104
00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:21.227
Not Zenin?

105
00:09:26.857 --> 00:09:28.317
Good for you.

106
00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:48.754
<i>What was that?</i>

107
00:09:53.217 --> 00:09:54.719
<i>Don't think about it now.</i>

108
00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:57.722
<i>I should find Miss Ieiri quickly.</i>

109
00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:00.057
<i>No.</i>

110
00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:02.476
<i>I have to check
if Maki and the others are safe.</i>

111
00:10:08.899 --> 00:10:10.735
This is more like it.

112
00:10:10.818 --> 00:10:13.154
This suits me the best.

113
00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:17.742
You want to assist that guy?

114
00:10:17.825 --> 00:10:21.954
You just want to use the opportunity
to reclaim Master Geto's body. right?

115
00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:22.955
No.

116
00:10:23.539 --> 00:10:26.584
The imposter's motive
and identity are still unclear.

117
00:10:27.084 --> 00:10:28.252
But...

118
00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:30.421
If the world falls into chaos.

119
00:10:30.504 --> 00:10:33.424
it's the non-sorcerer monkeys
who will suffer the most.

120
00:10:33.507 --> 00:10:35.968
Only the strong will survive.

121
00:10:36.677 --> 00:10:39.805
Monkeys will be phased out.
while sorcerers will increase.

122
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:41.724
Cursed spirits will gradually disappear.

123
00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:44.769
That is the world Master Geto wanted.

124
00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:46.771
So I will assist him.

125
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:49.815
His body is no concern of ours
at the moment.

126
00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:52.943
It's about carrying on a will.

127
00:10:53.027 --> 00:10:55.988
Don't make it more complicated.

128
00:10:56.072 --> 00:11:00.826
How can we stand by and watch the person
we love being used like a zombie?

129
00:11:01.535 --> 00:11:04.246
Master Geto's story has come to an end.

130
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.415
I will not let anyone tarnish it.

131
00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:09.418
You should start acting
like an adult. Nanako.

132
00:11:11.295 --> 00:11:13.297
Adult or child...

133
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:16.425
We have nothing left to discuss
if you talk like that!

134
00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:24.725
Stop. both of you.

135
00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:31.357
The last thing Suguru wants to see
is us hurting each other.

136
00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:34.860
Neither of you are wrong.

137
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.738
Let's part ways here.

138
00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:41.367
Do what you want to do.

139
00:11:42.076 --> 00:11:43.702
Larue. what about you?

140
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.831
I will not join either side.

141
00:11:46.914 --> 00:11:48.332
Just like Miguel.

142
00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:53.504
I only wanted to make Suguru the king.

143
00:11:54.296 --> 00:11:55.131
But...

144
00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:57.508
never forget.

145
00:11:58.592 --> 00:12:00.469
We are family.

146
00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:03.931
One day. somewhere.

147
00:12:04.723 --> 00:12:06.934
we will gather again for a meal.

148
00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:12.106
We've inherited Master Geto's will.

149
00:12:12.189 --> 00:12:13.774
Since you are from the high school.

150
00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:16.360
I think there's no need for more words.

151
00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:19.071
Are you going to surrender or not?

152
00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.240
I hate indecisive men.

153
00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:24.743
I'm a panda.
so she's not talking about me.

154
00:12:24.827 --> 00:12:28.289
<i>She made it so brief. damn it.</i>

155
00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:33.252
<i>But then again.
they are just a mediocre group.</i>

156
00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:35.546
<i>It's too easy.</i>

157
00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:39.258
<i>I will just deal with it casually
and kill time.</i>

158
00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:45.014
New Shadow Style.
Evening Moon Sword Drawing.

159
00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:46.599
Is this your response?

160
00:13:11.832 --> 00:13:14.335
<i>As a thank you for the fingers...
Just come at me.</i>

161
00:13:14.418 --> 00:13:18.380
<i>If you can hit me once.
I'll work under you.</i>

162
00:13:19.089 --> 00:13:23.469
<i>I can start with killing
all the humans in Shibuya.</i>

163
00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:26.180
<i>except for one.</i>

164
00:13:26.263 --> 00:13:27.348
Is this all you've got?

165
00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:29.975
-It's not over yet!
-Cursed spirit!

166
00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.268
<i>Geto. how many fingers of Sukuna
are equal to my strength?</i>

167
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.313
<i>As an overestimation.
around eight or nine?</i>

168
00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:25.739
<i>I knew.</i>

169
00:14:26.782 --> 00:14:28.826
<i>I knew it.</i>

170
00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:17.082
<i>I knew there would be
difference in strength.</i>

171
00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:19.084
<i>But I didn't expect it to be this much.</i>

172
00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:34.850
The moonlight is so bright.

173
00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:39.355
Thanks to that.
I can clearly see how miserable you are.

174
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.985
Come on. you can do it.

175
00:15:45.569 --> 00:15:47.112
Until I get bored.

176
00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:49.281
I will keep playing with you.

177
00:15:52.868 --> 00:15:55.746
This place is dangerous now. Run!

178
00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:56.830
Where are you going?

179
00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:59.208
Listen!

180
00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:07.675
Curse users. listen carefully.

181
00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:08.926
I'm not sure why.

182
00:16:09.009 --> 00:16:10.844
But there are special grades
killing each other.

183
00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:13.889
They're basically like
elephants tap dancing on ants.

184
00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.518
-Hurry up.
-To be clear. we're the ants.

185
00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:24.441
Maximum.

186
00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:26.860
Meteor.

187
00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:34.410
New Shadow Style.

188
00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.620
Batto Sword Drawing.

189
00:16:37.204 --> 00:16:38.038
Panda.

190
00:16:38.622 --> 00:16:40.040
Let's escape...

191
00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:41.333
I won't allow that.

192
00:16:44.169 --> 00:16:47.423
From now on. all humans within a block

193
00:16:47.923 --> 00:16:51.844
are not allowed to move until I say okay.

194
00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:55.931
If anyone dares to defy it.
they will be killed without mercy.

195
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.228
Not yet.

196
00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:04.356
Not yet.

197
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:10.988
Okay.

198
00:17:28.505 --> 00:17:32.509
Even Sukuna wouldn't come out unscathed.

199
00:17:34.094 --> 00:17:35.763
But you have to hit me first.

200
00:17:37.639 --> 00:17:40.517
Why don't you use your domain?

201
00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:46.440
I know I can't defeat you
in a battle of domains.

202
00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:49.985
Because that was how
you lost to Satoru Gojo?

203
00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:53.530
Spoken like a true loser.

204
00:17:55.115 --> 00:17:58.952
But I'm just getting excited.

205
00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:01.622
How about I fight your way?

206
00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:05.459
<i>Open.</i>

207
00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:08.879
Is that...

208
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.633
fire?

209
00:18:13.717 --> 00:18:17.888
<i>Aren't Sukuna's techniques
slicing and slashing?</i>

210
00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:22.851
I see. I thought you knew.

211
00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:25.896
But I guess cursed spirits wouldn't know.

212
00:18:25.979 --> 00:18:27.439
Don't worry.

213
00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:30.359
I won't resort to the trick
of revealing the technique.

214
00:18:31.902 --> 00:18:33.237
Get ready.

215
00:18:36.031 --> 00:18:38.075
Let's have a battle of firepower.

216
00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:12.234
Sorry. Hanami. Dagon.

217
00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:15.445
Mahito is still out there.

218
00:19:17.739 --> 00:19:20.993
Humans fear and detest death.

219
00:19:21.618 --> 00:19:23.370
<i>But on the other end of death.</i>

220
00:19:23.453 --> 00:19:25.706
<i>there are also humans standing.</i>

221
00:19:26.206 --> 00:19:28.834
<i>To humans. death is a mirror.</i>

222
00:19:28.917 --> 00:19:32.421
<i>And Mahito is that mirror.</i>

223
00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:36.925
Mahito can become even stronger.

224
00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:41.054
That's why you made him the leader. right?

225
00:19:42.055 --> 00:19:44.474
When we are reborn.

226
00:19:44.558 --> 00:19:47.394
we will no longer be ourselves.

227
00:19:47.477 --> 00:19:51.690
Even so. I really want
to meet you all again.

228
00:19:52.941 --> 00:19:56.028
We are the real humans.

229
00:19:56.111 --> 00:19:58.113
What?

230
00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:01.491
You wanted to become a human?

231
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.537
I understand what you mean.

232
00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:08.040
You don't want to actually become a human.

233
00:20:08.123 --> 00:20:11.585
You just want to attain
the status of a human.

234
00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:15.255
Even though I understand.
I still find it incredibly dull.

235
00:20:16.173 --> 00:20:20.260
<i>Crowds of humans. crowds of curses.</i>

236
00:20:20.344 --> 00:20:23.138
<i>Measuring themselves by those around them</i>

237
00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:26.600
<i>makes all beings weaker and weaker.</i>

238
00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:30.187
You should have burned everything.

239
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:33.857
No calculations or plans. just randomly.

240
00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:36.318
Until you reach the realm of Satoru Gojo.

241
00:20:36.401 --> 00:20:39.029
Not thinking about the future or identity.

242
00:20:39.655 --> 00:20:42.115
What you lacked is

243
00:20:42.199 --> 00:20:45.118
the hunger to cling to your ideals.

244
00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:50.123
Maybe you're right.

245
00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:52.960
But.

246
00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:55.254
I had fun.

247
00:20:57.214 --> 00:20:59.758
Humans. sorcerers. cursed spirits...

248
00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:03.971
Compared to those I fought
a thousand years ago. you're not bad.

249
00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:06.765
Be proud.

250
00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:09.601
You are strong.

251
00:21:14.856 --> 00:21:17.651
What is this?

252
00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:20.529
Who knows.

253
00:21:22.489 --> 00:21:24.408
I don't know either.

254
00:21:35.002 --> 00:21:36.420
Who are you?

255
00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.089
I have come to greet you.

256
00:21:41.008 --> 00:21:42.134
Lord Sukuna.

257
00:21:45.804 --> 00:21:47.222
Are you Uraume?

258
00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:49.349
It's a pleasure to see you again.

259
00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:52.561
{\an8}23:07 DOGENZAKA. IN FRONT OF SHIBUYA 109

260
00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:54.354
{\an8}Are you kidding?

261
00:21:55.647 --> 00:21:56.565
Damn it...

262
00:22:00.235 --> 00:22:02.946
Get up. you damn sorcerer!

263
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:39.334
<i>I see videos of Coke with Mentos
on the internet. Is that real?</i>

264
00:23:39.417 --> 00:23:40.252
<i>Why?</i>

265
00:23:40.335 --> 00:23:43.797
<i>I think I accidentally had Mentos
with Coke as a child.</i>

266
00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.508
<i>but I don't remember it.
so the video must be fake.</i>

267
00:23:46.591 --> 00:23:47.425
<i>Okay. eat it.</i>

268
00:23:47.509 --> 00:23:49.010
<i>Next episode. Thunderbolt. Part 2.</i>

269
00:23:49.094 --> 00:23:50.971
<i>-See you next week.
-See you next week.</i>
