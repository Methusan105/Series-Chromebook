1
00:00:02.627 --> 00:00:03.712
Mr. Nanami.

2
00:00:05.213 --> 00:00:09.968
That octopus thinks
I am fighting against his domain.

3
00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:13.138
But I have a different purpose.

4
00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:17.017
<i>I want to make a hole in the domain</i>

5
00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:19.853
<i>in this barrier.</i>

6
00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:23.398
{\an8}The hole I came through has been closed.

7
00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:25.400
{\an8}It's harder to make it from the inside.

8
00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:29.988
{\an8}but I can open a big enough hole
for a few seconds.

9
00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:32.115
The edge of the barrier is under my feet.

10
00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.659
I touched it when I came in. so I know.

11
00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:37.954
I can start at any time.
You three just need to rush in together.

12
00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:42.834
{\an8}We can't leave you behind.

13
00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:44.919
{\an8}I will stake my life...

14
00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:47.672
{\an8}but I don't intend to sacrifice it.

15
00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:56.681
You two...

16
00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:01.186
Gather!

17
00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.733
<i>The enemy can understand human speech.</i>

18
00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:11.863
<i>They trust the Grade 1 sorcerer who
conveys his intention in a roundabout way.</i>

19
00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:16.201
<i>Get out of this domain.</i>

20
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:20.997
<i>The option that seemed no longer possible
is back on the table.</i>

21
00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:25.210
<i>They want to protect that boy together?</i>

22
00:01:25.293 --> 00:01:27.670
<i>It's easier for me to take them all at...</i>

23
00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:29.130
<i>No!</i>

24
00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:31.925
<i>He noticed?! But it's too late.</i>

25
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:33.676
To Fushiguro's feet!

26
00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:53.154
<i>Those who were born
inheriting the Zenin Family's curse.</i>

27
00:01:55.406 --> 00:01:58.785
<i>The one who couldn't fully
leave behind that curse.</i>

28
00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.663
<i>They witness with their own eyes</i>

29
00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.751
<i>the bear flesh of the person</i>

30
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.796
<i>who abandoned everything.</i>

31
00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:13.299
<i>And his vigor.</i>

32
00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:15.760
<i>Who is he?</i>

33
00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:17.387
<i>A human...</i>

34
00:02:18.012 --> 00:02:19.305
<i>A sorcerer?</i>

35
00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:25.311
<i>They didn't escape.
but invited a new sorcerer in?</i>

36
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.319
<i>So fast. Wasn't he just in the air?</i>

37
00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:35.196
<i>And he's not just fast...</i>

38
00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.949
<i>He is way too strong.</i>

39
00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.163
Maki!

40
00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:45.874
<i>I didn't sense his cursed energy at all.</i>

41
00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:49.669
<i>I lost to him in terms of strength?
I can't believe it.</i>

42
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.171
Fushiguro.

43
00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:55.216
It's no use.
The hole has been already closed.

44
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.677
And now he knows our plan.

45
00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:01.180
{\an8}He won't give us a chance
to open a new hole.

46
00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:13.067
Toji?

47
00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:18.948
<i>Granny Ogami's Séance technique
continues even after her death.</i>

48
00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:22.660
<i>When the cursed energy of her grandson.
who serves as a vessel. is exhausted.</i>

49
00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:25.330
<i>séance is supposed to end.</i>

50
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.755
<i>Her grandchild's soul that was overwritten
by Toji Zenin has no cursed energy.</i>

51
00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:37.634
<i>Besides. this body does not consume
cursed energy.</i>

52
00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:42.013
<i>so the cursed technique
has lost its endpoint.</i>

53
00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:47.644
<i>This series of anomalies led
to the loss of control of the technique.</i>

54
00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:53.900
<i>Now. Toji Zenin will fight on instinct
until the vessel breaks.</i>

55
00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:57.403
<i>He has turned into a killing puppet.</i>

56
00:03:58.112 --> 00:03:59.614
<i>This man</i>

57
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.407
<i>has no cursed energy?</i>

58
00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:04.118
You're insignificant.

59
00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.934
<i>His fangs...</i>

60
00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:31.938
<i>always point to the strong.</i>

61
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.210
Old man.

62
00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:25.129
Who is that guy?

63
00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:37.934
A ghost.

64
00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:44.774
Fushiguro. can you hold on a bit longer?

65
00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:47.985
Okay.

66
00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:49.028
I'm sorry.

67
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.155
{\an8}I have to bet on him.

68
00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:05.419
<i>Rubbing Playful Cloud together...</i>

69
00:09:06.587 --> 00:09:07.672
<i>Is he...</i>

70
00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:12.176
<i>sharpening them?</i>

71
00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:23.980
<i>Am I going to lose?</i>

72
00:09:26.023 --> 00:09:29.193
<i>To a human without cursed energy?</i>

73
00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:33.614
<i>No. I can feel
the kid's domain is weakening.</i>

74
00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:37.201
<i>As long as I can restore
the guaranteed hit. I can kill everyone.</i>

75
00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:40.538
<i>I need to buy some time.</i>

76
00:09:41.038 --> 00:09:43.708
Right. you can suspend in the air.

77
00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:47.503
Do I need to repeat myself?

78
00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:02.476
It's not

79
00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:04.103
over...

80
00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:28.252
The domain is gone.

81
00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:31.005
<i>He really exorcised
that octopus on his own.</i>

82
00:10:36.552 --> 00:10:41.140
<i>If Fushiguro hadn't come in time.
we'd certainly have been wiped out.</i>

83
00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:44.977
{\an8}<i>But there's still one problem.</i>

84
00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:49.982
<i>Is he on our side?</i>

85
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:26.519
What?

86
00:11:30.731 --> 00:11:33.359
<i>When did I come outside?</i>

87
00:11:34.902 --> 00:11:36.529
<i>He is ridiculously fast.</i>

88
00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:38.614
<i>Maybe even faster than Sukuna.</i>

89
00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:42.118
<i>Who on earth is this guy?</i>

90
00:11:43.327 --> 00:11:44.495
Megumi!

91
00:11:52.169 --> 00:11:54.630
Are you dead. Dagon?

92
00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:58.801
<i>Come on. what kind of joke is this?</i>

93
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.554
<i>He's much stronger...</i>

94
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.265
Let me handle the rest.

95
00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:06.559
<i>than the cursed spirit called Dagon.</i>

96
00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:11.021
Even if we don't live on humans.
our souls will still reincarnate.

97
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.568
Let's meet again in the wilderness
in a hundred years.

98
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:22.074
Now...

99
00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:28.330
The first one.

100
00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:30.833
Mr. Nana...

101
00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:33.335
The second one.

102
00:12:58.235 --> 00:13:00.362
The third one.

103
00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:06.076
Sukuna.

104
00:13:06.827 --> 00:13:09.747
<i>No. it's the finger.</i>

105
00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:14.001
<i>Sukuna's finger was released
somewhere in Shibuya.</i>

106
00:13:15.169 --> 00:13:16.629
We need to hurry. Nanako.

107
00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:20.216
The finger might attract cursed spirits.

108
00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:21.509
I know.

109
00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:23.344
Please.

110
00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:25.262
Come out.

111
00:13:28.057 --> 00:13:29.391
Lord Sukuna.

112
00:13:42.613 --> 00:13:45.366
You two. how many fingers
did you feed him?

113
00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:47.368
I won't tell you.

114
00:13:47.451 --> 00:13:48.619
Mimiko!

115
00:13:48.702 --> 00:13:50.329
Fine. Then die.

116
00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:59.004
<i>Good. the marks haven't disappeared.</i>

117
00:13:59.588 --> 00:14:03.509
<i>Although it's unexpected.
I need to take full advantage of this.</i>

118
00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:08.889
Even if Yuji Itadori absorbs
all of the 20 fingers.

119
00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:12.476
he probably won't hand over
the control of his body to Sukuna.

120
00:14:13.727 --> 00:14:20.025
But that's if he absorbs
a finger a day for 20 days.

121
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.153
If he eats ten fingers at a time.

122
00:14:23.237 --> 00:14:25.406
he won't have time to adapt.

123
00:14:25.489 --> 00:14:29.785
Although it's only temporary. the control
of his body will be transferred to Sukuna.

124
00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:40.921
Wake up.

125
00:14:41.505 --> 00:14:42.464
Sukuna.

126
00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:02.776
{\an8}<i>I fed him all ten.</i>

127
00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:07.197
{\an8}<i>So now. there are
at least 15 fingers in him.</i>

128
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:19.251
You are still alive.

129
00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.254
<i>It's probably because of
one of their techniques.</i>

130
00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:26.050
<i>But they're so scared.
they probably can't do it several times.</i>

131
00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:28.636
Don't waste my time.

132
00:15:35.517 --> 00:15:37.019
You have one second.

133
00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:40.522
Move away.

134
00:15:47.905 --> 00:15:49.531
<i>This is Sukuna.</i>

135
00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:52.534
<i>A formidable power
different from Satoru Gojo's.</i>

136
00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:54.620
<i>An overwhelming evil.</i>

137
00:15:55.371 --> 00:16:00.542
<i>The fear that every move of both sides
could be the cause of death.</i>

138
00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:09.051
<i>Breathe...</i>

139
00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:13.013
{\an8}<i>Can we breathe? He won't kill us. right?</i>

140
00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:33.075
You're holding your heads too high.

141
00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:46.088
{\an8}Did you think kneeling
on one knee would be enough?

142
00:16:46.922 --> 00:16:49.091
The boughs that bear most hang lowest.

143
00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:51.760
It seems your head doesn't bear much.

144
00:16:53.637 --> 00:16:54.596
Brats.

145
00:16:55.222 --> 00:16:56.640
I'll start with you.

146
00:16:57.474 --> 00:17:00.102
Do you have something to ask of me?

147
00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:03.355
I'll give you one finger's worth of time.

148
00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:04.606
Say it.

149
00:17:11.613 --> 00:17:12.740
Down there...

150
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:17.077
Down there is a man with stitches
on his forehead wearing a monk's robe.

151
00:17:20.164 --> 00:17:21.206
Please...

152
00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:24.960
Please kill him.

153
00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:28.589
Please...

154
00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:32.468
free Master Geto.

155
00:17:42.978 --> 00:17:44.772
Master Geto.

156
00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:47.316
Who is Satoru Gojo?

157
00:17:48.025 --> 00:17:49.318
He's super strong. right?

158
00:17:50.652 --> 00:17:51.653
Yeah.

159
00:17:52.237 --> 00:17:53.989
He used to be my friend.

160
00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:56.658
We had a fight
and haven't seen each other since then.

161
00:17:58.702 --> 00:17:59.661
<i>I like you.</i>

162
00:18:01.288 --> 00:18:02.372
<i>I like you.</i>

163
00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:05.000
<i>I like you.</i>

164
00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:06.794
<i>I like you.</i>

165
00:18:12.132 --> 00:18:14.968
<i>Satoru Gojo killed Master Geto.</i>

166
00:18:15.052 --> 00:18:17.304
<i>We will never forgive him.</i>

167
00:18:17.387 --> 00:18:20.808
<i>But we thought we could let things be.</i>

168
00:18:21.683 --> 00:18:26.563
<i>Because Satoru Gojo is Master Geto's
one and only best friend. after all.</i>

169
00:18:27.731 --> 00:18:28.941
<i>You're not.</i>

170
00:18:30.526 --> 00:18:31.985
<i>Go to hell.</i>

171
00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:34.488
<i>I'll make you regret it.</i>

172
00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:39.576
We know the location of another finger.

173
00:18:41.745 --> 00:18:43.455
If you can kill him.

174
00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:45.791
we'll tell you where it is.

175
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.918
So...

176
00:18:48.877 --> 00:18:51.046
-Please...
-Raise your heads.

177
00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:12.609
Mimiko...

178
00:19:12.693 --> 00:19:14.987
Do you think you can command me

179
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.656
-just for a finger or two?
-No! Mimiko!

180
00:19:17.739 --> 00:19:21.160
No! Mimiko...

181
00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:22.661
Annoying.

182
00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:24.496
Sukuna!

183
00:19:25.247 --> 00:19:26.081
Die!

184
00:19:42.055 --> 00:19:43.390
Cell phone...

185
00:19:43.473 --> 00:19:46.310
No. the camera?

186
00:19:46.393 --> 00:19:51.023
It can probably have
some effect on the filmed subject.

187
00:19:52.065 --> 00:19:53.108
Boring.

188
00:19:54.401 --> 00:19:55.527
Your turn.

189
00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:58.822
Cursed spirit. what do you want from me?

190
00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:02.159
I want

191
00:20:03.493 --> 00:20:04.661
nothing.

192
00:20:06.997 --> 00:20:08.165
{\an8}What?

193
00:20:08.749 --> 00:20:13.253
Our goal is to fully revive you.

194
00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:19.801
Itadori hasn't adapted yet.
so you are temporarily granted freedom.

195
00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:23.805
You should know that better than anyone.

196
00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:30.479
<i>Even if Sukuna's Reverse Cursed Technique
can cure others.</i>

197
00:20:30.562 --> 00:20:35.943
<i>souls transfigured by Mahito's
Idle Transfiguration can't be fixed.</i>

198
00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:39.738
<i>It's not that...</i>

199
00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:42.699
<i>Sukuna didn't make a Binding Vow then.</i>

200
00:20:42.783 --> 00:20:44.451
<i>he couldn't.</i>

201
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.789
Before Yuji Itadori returns.

202
00:20:48.872 --> 00:20:51.500
you must make a Binding Vow with him.

203
00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:56.255
{\an8}One that allows you
to take over his body permanently.

204
00:20:57.506 --> 00:21:01.051
Many of Itadori's companions are here.

205
00:21:01.134 --> 00:21:04.096
There are plenty of ways.

206
00:21:09.226 --> 00:21:10.686
No need.

207
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.192
{\an8}I have my own plan.

208
00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:19.736
{\an8}But... well...

209
00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:24.283
You are desperate too.

210
00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:27.286
As a thank you for the fingers...

211
00:21:27.369 --> 00:21:28.495
Just come at me.

212
00:21:29.329 --> 00:21:31.707
If you can hit me once.

213
00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:34.793
I'll work under you.

214
00:21:40.173 --> 00:21:44.136
I can start with killing
all the humans in Shibuya.

215
00:21:45.053 --> 00:21:46.722
{\an8}except for one.

216
00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:57.816
It's a deal.

217
00:23:31.576 --> 00:23:35.330
<i>-This is how you play Jujutsu.
-There are minors here. you know.</i>

218
00:23:35.413 --> 00:23:38.083
<i>-Barrier! Technique! Yoyoinoyoi!
-Students are watching.</i>

219
00:23:38.166 --> 00:23:41.294
<i>I made paper. Those made scissors
might have good luck tomorrow.</i>

220
00:23:41.378 --> 00:23:43.088
<i>Don't suddenly make it kid-friendly.</i>

221
00:23:43.171 --> 00:23:44.422
<i>Next episode. Thunderbolt.</i>

222
00:23:44.506 --> 00:23:45.924
<i>Yup I'm drunk.</i>
