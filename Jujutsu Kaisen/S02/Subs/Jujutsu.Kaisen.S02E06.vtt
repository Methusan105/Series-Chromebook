WEBVTT

00:02.980 --> 00:04.850
I think I'll go see a movie.

00:05.120 --> 00:06.500
What about you, Kugisaki?

00:06.500 --> 00:09.590
It's still early. I'll go shopping or something.

00:09.680 --> 00:11.710
You all have so much energy.

00:11.710 --> 00:13.730
I'm going home, then.

00:14.660 --> 00:16.160
Take care.

00:18.190 --> 00:20.060
Finally done.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.690
I'm going to the movies. What about you?

00:24.070 --> 00:25.580
What are you seeing?

00:25.580 --> 00:27.250
<i>Human Earthworm 4</i>.

00:27.250 --> 00:28.240
Who'd ever go see that?

00:28.240 --> 00:30.790
I haven't even seen 1, 2, or 3.

00:30.790 --> 00:33.470
I think you'd be fine jumping in on 4.

00:34.300 --> 00:37.270
This time, the mad scientist 
from the first one,

00:37.270 --> 00:40.300
Dr. Richter, is making his 
long-awaited reappearance!

00:37.650 --> 00:40.940
Stop! Let me go!

00:40.300 --> 00:43.520
And the hybrid human-earthworm fusion 
born from the doctor's experiments

00:43.520 --> 00:45.920
is going to give rise to an 
enhanced Human Earthworm!

00:45.920 --> 00:47.800
What the hell? That's so gross.

00:48.270 --> 00:52.340
The poor Human Earthworm, who barely 
escaped from Dr. Richter with its life,

00:52.340 --> 00:56.190
finally wanders into a campground 
where a group of college students are,

00:56.190 --> 00:58.550
and that's when the story really kicks off.

00:58.550 --> 01:03.450
So, one of the people in that group is a kind 
woman who's an animal rights proponent,

01:03.450 --> 01:06.070
and the Human Earthworm 
falls in love with her.

01:06.550 --> 01:09.480
I'm no longer human.

01:09.480 --> 01:11.860
You're more human than anyone else.

01:12.120 --> 01:13.450
It's a monster! Kill it!

01:13.450 --> 01:14.900
Kevin, stop!

01:14.900 --> 01:17.500
If we kill him, then we're the monsters!

01:19.600 --> 01:21.340
Papa.

01:21.340 --> 01:23.460
Papa?

01:21.340 --> 01:23.460
Are you okay?

01:21.340 --> 01:23.460
What's wrong?

01:23.460 --> 01:24.850
<b>Human Earthworm 4</b>

01:25.090 --> 01:28.220
So the theme is actually love!

01:32.220 --> 01:35.860
I don't want see some wormo man, 
regardless of the theme.

01:36.390 --> 01:38.220
It's "Human Earthworm."

01:38.220 --> 01:40.110
It doesn't matter.

01:40.110 --> 01:42.840
I'm going shopping, okay?

01:43.200 --> 01:44.410
Want to come with?

01:44.410 --> 01:46.940
I just said I'm going to the movies.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.580
Okay. Later, then.

01:58.370 --> 02:04.500
Special-grade is a rank reserved for 
those sorcerers who are exceptional.

02:04.500 --> 02:08.640
In my opinion, first-grade is 
the true rank for the sorcerers

02:08.640 --> 02:12.170
who will lead other sorcerers 
and jujutsu society.

02:12.170 --> 02:18.170
They must stand above comparison to semi-first-
grades in terms of peril, secrecy, and salary.

02:18.170 --> 02:21.430
Now, with that in mind, 
what did you just say?

02:21.430 --> 02:24.310
Maki Zen'in, Panda...

02:24.310 --> 02:30.380
...Megumi Fushiguro, Nobara Kugisaki, 
and my brother, Yuji Itadori.

02:30.380 --> 02:33.150
On my name as Aoi Todo...

02:33.430 --> 02:35.620
And on my name as Mei Mei...

02:35.930 --> 02:38.780
I recommend those five 
for first-grade sorcerer.

02:41.760 --> 02:47.520
Those who are recommended 
by at least two first-grades

02:47.520 --> 02:50.620
must carry out missions under 
an active first-grade,

02:50.620 --> 02:52.600
or first-grade equivalent sorcerer.

02:54.380 --> 02:59.550
Then, if they are deemed fit, 
they will be promoted to semi-first-grade

02:59.550 --> 03:03.340
and proceed to be assigned 
first-grade missions on their own.

03:03.340 --> 03:05.620
Following the results of those missions,

03:05.620 --> 03:10.100
they either will or won't officially 
become first-grade sorcerers.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.100
My brother will certainly accept 
the recommendation.

03:14.100 --> 03:16.150
With Sukuna still uncooperative,

03:16.150 --> 03:18.400
he'll need to go on more dangerous missions

03:18.400 --> 03:21.780
to raise his chances of finding more fingers.

03:21.780 --> 03:25.700
You understand what 
that means, right, Ms. Mei?

03:27.760 --> 03:32.590
What that means? 
That's everything, Mr. Todo.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.550
A bright future...

03:44.550 --> 03:47.650
It means a bright future 
where Aoi Todo and Yuji Itadori

03:47.650 --> 03:53.980
face missions together lies ahead of us!

03:53.980 --> 03:54.750
No...

03:54.750 --> 03:56.420
You don't have to say it.

03:56.420 --> 03:59.550
There's no guarantee I'll be the first-grade 
sorcerer assigned to accompany him.

03:59.550 --> 04:01.350
That's what you wanted to say, right?

04:01.350 --> 04:03.590
But I'm certain of this!

04:03.600 --> 04:06.460
It's as certain as apples 
falling from a tree!

04:06.460 --> 04:08.940
The two of us are drawn together!

04:10.830 --> 04:15.390
Yes, it truly is destiny!

04:15.800 --> 04:17.300
No, I mean...

04:17.300 --> 04:22.010
The sorcerers who recommended him 
can't be assigned to accompany him.

04:23.770 --> 04:26.980
Since we're the two that 
recommended Itadori-kun,

04:26.980 --> 04:30.990
someone else will have to accompany him.

04:31.620 --> 04:32.860
Thanks for today.

04:32.860 --> 04:35.930
I'll be leaving now, Mr. Todo.

04:46.410 --> 04:48.460
Um, excuse me.

04:51.450 --> 04:55.620
You were with Itadori-kun earlier, right?

04:57.870 --> 04:59.010
Huh?

05:09.580 --> 05:14.080
<b>JUJUTSU KAISEN
Shibuya Incident</b>

06:32.290 --> 06:34.060
Welcome!

06:34.300 --> 06:37.770
This is what I looked like at our 
middle school graduation ceremony.

06:37.770 --> 06:40.980
Huh?! Seriously?! That was only six months ago!

06:40.980 --> 06:42.950
What happened to you?!

06:42.950 --> 06:47.370
Well, I've grown about 
15 centimeters since then.

06:47.640 --> 06:51.950
That combined with the stress of moving 
to Tokyo and changing environments...

06:51.950 --> 06:53.820
Wow...

06:53.820 --> 06:56.320
You're a real Kuroko Sato.

06:57.080 --> 06:58.830
That's Itadori.

06:58.830 --> 07:02.930
On graduation day, I worked up the 
courage to ask for a photo with him.

07:02.930 --> 07:06.150
I actually wanted to ask 
for his phone number,

07:06.150 --> 07:08.900
but it was already decided 
that we would be moving to Tokyo...

07:09.680 --> 07:12.320
So when I saw Itadori-kun earlier,

07:12.660 --> 07:16.380
I thought maybe with 
how I look now, I might...

07:16.700 --> 07:19.990
Wait... Yuko, you mean...

07:20.610 --> 07:22.400
It's like <i>that</i>, right?

07:22.400 --> 07:24.460
Yes! It's like <i>that</i>!

07:27.160 --> 07:28.660
Hey, Ijichi-san.

07:28.660 --> 07:30.650
Is Fushiguro still riding with you?

07:30.650 --> 07:32.700
I sent you the URL for the restaurant I'm at.

07:32.700 --> 07:34.860
Could you turn around and bring him here?

07:34.860 --> 07:37.100
Thanks! See ya soon!

07:38.720 --> 07:41.690
Someone who knows Itadori well 
is on his way here now.

07:41.690 --> 07:42.680
Um...

07:42.680 --> 07:44.880
We'll talk to him about it first.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.090
Um...

07:47.510 --> 07:50.380
If you're also interested in Itadori-kun...

07:50.380 --> 07:51.380
No.

07:51.860 --> 07:54.270
Even if hell froze over 
and danced the lambada...

07:55.000 --> 07:56.240
No.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.470
<i>My chest just felt weird.</i>

08:03.140 --> 08:04.560
<i>Did my heart skip a beat?</i>

08:03.170 --> 08:07.630
Did my heart
skip a beat?

08:07.990 --> 08:10.120
Yo, what's the big idea?

08:10.120 --> 08:11.720
Hey, Fushiguro!

08:11.720 --> 08:13.470
Does Itadori have a girlfriend?

08:13.470 --> 08:14.380
Huh?

08:14.380 --> 08:16.140
This is Yuko Ozawa.

08:16.610 --> 08:19.580
She's actually blah, blah, blah.

08:19.580 --> 08:21.580
So it's like <i>that</i>?!

08:21.580 --> 08:23.800
Yeah, it's like <i>that</i>!

08:24.140 --> 08:25.990
He definitely doesn't have a girlfriend.

08:25.990 --> 08:27.270
Your basis for that?

08:27.270 --> 08:31.060
When he suddenly had to transfer to Tokyo, 
he didn't seem particularly upset about it.

08:31.700 --> 08:34.430
He also has a pinup 
poster hanging in his room.

08:34.430 --> 08:37.820
Anyone with a girlfriend wouldn't have 
something like that hanging up, right?

08:37.820 --> 08:39.330
Because she'd hate it.

08:39.330 --> 08:43.540
Are you the type to drink coffee black only 
when women are around so you can show off?

08:43.540 --> 08:44.480
Stop that.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.600
You called me out here 
to ask me about this, right?

08:47.600 --> 08:49.160
And I always drink it black.

08:49.850 --> 08:53.080
Um, by the way, do you know what his type is?

08:55.070 --> 08:57.830
He mentioned he likes tall girls.

09:01.090 --> 09:02.810
You have a shot!

09:02.810 --> 09:04.470
I'll summon Itadori!

09:04.470 --> 09:06.300
You're okay with that, right, Yuko?!

09:06.300 --> 09:07.590
Yes!

09:07.590 --> 09:12.060
Yuji Itadori

09:07.800 --> 09:12.060
Hey.

09:08.020 --> 09:12.060
FAMILY Restaurant

09:08.220 --> 09:12.060
Come.

09:09.300 --> 09:12.060
Why?

09:09.640 --> 09:12.060
Come.

09:10.430 --> 09:12.060
Got it.

09:13.300 --> 09:14.840
That was curt.

09:15.330 --> 09:16.340
Was it?

09:16.970 --> 09:18.770
Hey, Fushiguro's here, too!

09:18.770 --> 09:19.770
That was fast!

09:21.060 --> 09:23.440
<i>Oh, crap.</i>

09:23.440 --> 09:24.150
What's that?

09:24.150 --> 09:26.820
<i>I didn't tell Itadori about Yuko!</i>

09:24.970 --> 09:28.010
Finding a money exchange was a pain, 
so I traded in for prizes instead.

09:27.330 --> 09:30.720
<i>He definitely won't recognize her 
after she changed so much!</i>

09:33.050 --> 09:34.170
Who are you?

09:34.770 --> 09:40.500
<i>That's the number one line you don't want to 
hear when reuniting with the one you adore!</i>

09:41.020 --> 09:41.950
Itadori!

09:41.950 --> 09:43.050
This girl is—

09:41.950 --> 09:43.050
Wait...

09:43.050 --> 09:45.560
You're Ozawa. What are you doing here?

09:47.790 --> 09:49.090
What a coincidence.

09:51.500 --> 09:54.890
Okay, so which girl in our 
class do you like, Itadori?

10:03.120 --> 10:05.020
None of them, really.

10:05.020 --> 10:07.160
But if you <i>had</i> to pick!

10:07.810 --> 10:09.020
Huh?

10:09.020 --> 10:11.990
If I had to pick, then... Ozawa.

10:12.690 --> 10:14.080
What?!

10:14.080 --> 10:17.420
No way, man! She's fat!

10:19.470 --> 10:20.740
Is she?

10:20.740 --> 10:26.350
But the way she eats and her handwriting 
and stuff are super nice.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.680
I mean, fish is hard to eat, you know?

10:32.680 --> 10:36.490
I thought you said you liked 
tall girls with big butts?

10:36.920 --> 10:39.130
That's its own thing!

10:42.500 --> 10:47.060
<i>It's easy for girls to get fat.</i>

10:47.060 --> 10:49.720
<i>I started off fat...</i>

10:57.940 --> 11:02.900
<i>But even I don't have any interest in 
choosing someone who won't choose me.</i>

11:15.400 --> 11:19.370
<i>Itadori-kun saw a side of me I wasn't aware of.</i>

11:21.040 --> 11:23.650
<i>I hated all the boys other than Itadori-kun.</i>

11:25.230 --> 11:26.230
<i>But...</i>

11:27.180 --> 11:33.300
<i>"Maybe with how I look now, I might..."</i>

11:34.770 --> 11:40.670
<i>I'm living by the same 
standards as the people I hate.</i>

11:46.380 --> 11:47.240
Later.

11:47.240 --> 11:47.830
See you tomorrow.

11:47.830 --> 11:48.590
Later.

11:50.850 --> 11:52.030
See you later.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.890
Was that really okay?

12:10.890 --> 12:12.950
They could have at least exchanged numbers.

12:12.950 --> 12:16.690
I exchanged with her. It should be fine.

12:16.690 --> 12:20.720
More importantly, Fushiguro,
I've finally realized my own feelings.

12:20.720 --> 12:21.650
Huh?

12:21.650 --> 12:24.460
The thought that Itadori 
might land a girlfriend

12:24.460 --> 12:26.740
before I get a boyfriend pisses me off.

12:26.740 --> 12:27.960
That so?

12:27.960 --> 12:29.580
Sorry for the wait.

12:29.580 --> 12:31.420
Walk behind me.

12:31.420 --> 12:33.700
Huh? Say what? What are you talking about?

12:33.700 --> 12:34.710
Here.

12:34.710 --> 12:36.170
Oh! Thanks!

12:36.170 --> 12:36.910
Here.

12:36.910 --> 12:39.220
Huh? Huh? What's this?

12:39.220 --> 12:40.740
Just while you're at it.

12:40.740 --> 12:41.370
While I'm at it?

12:41.370 --> 12:44.980
You'd feel bad making 
a lady carry them, right?

12:46.530 --> 12:47.790
Sure.

12:47.790 --> 12:49.820
Oh, crap! The movie's starting!

12:49.820 --> 12:50.890
Hey, let's go!

12:50.890 --> 12:53.020
Huh?! Hold up!

12:51.320 --> 12:53.020
Come on, come on, come on!

12:53.020 --> 12:54.350
Don't take mine with you!

12:54.350 --> 12:56.550
There's no way I'm watching some wormo man!

12:56.550 --> 12:58.340
You want some popcorn, too, Fushiguro?

12:58.340 --> 12:59.570
You like caramel flavor, right?

12:59.570 --> 13:02.060
Don't just advance the conversation 
assuming we're gonna see wormo man.

13:02.060 --> 13:04.990
I told you all, it's <i>Human Earthworm 4</i>!

13:02.950 --> 13:05.960
<b>Episode 30
It's Like That</b>

13:25.950 --> 13:27.360
Impossible!

13:27.360 --> 13:29.880
Working with a curse user is 
one thing, but cursed spirits?!

13:29.880 --> 13:33.620
Yet, lately, cursed spirits of that level 
have been popping up everywhere.

13:33.620 --> 13:37.290
The person in question may think they're 
only working with curse users, though.

13:38.460 --> 13:41.670
I want to leave the investigation 
of Kyoto up to you, Utahime.

13:45.670 --> 13:46.840
This way.

13:48.260 --> 13:50.970
You've heard from Gojo about 
the person leaking intel, right?

13:51.350 --> 13:52.390
Yes.

13:52.390 --> 13:55.480
There's probably two or more people 
in contact with the curse users.

13:55.480 --> 13:58.020
One would be a higher-up, 
well above the principal.

13:58.020 --> 14:00.400
I won't be able to do 
anything about that one.

14:00.980 --> 14:05.240
The other would be someone passing 
the information up to that higher-up.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.530
That one is our current target.

14:08.270 --> 14:11.780
They're only a suspect at this point, 
so we'll capture and interrogate them.

14:12.340 --> 14:14.490
So, who from Kyoto is it?

14:14.490 --> 14:15.330
Oh?!

14:15.580 --> 14:19.330
That's why you asked those 
of us from Tokyo, right?

14:19.330 --> 14:21.290
Kugisaki, you're incredible.

14:24.630 --> 14:26.420
The mole is...

14:26.420 --> 14:28.130
Mechamaru!

14:28.130 --> 14:30.010
Oh, there you are.

14:30.440 --> 14:33.140
Today's the last day 
to turn in your notebook.

14:37.140 --> 14:38.190
Mechamaru?

14:39.280 --> 14:42.610
<i>Sorry, Miwa. I'm going to sleep for a bit.</i>

14:44.110 --> 14:46.820
<i>Please take the notebook from my desk.</i>

14:46.820 --> 14:49.950
Sleep? It's still only evening.

14:53.070 --> 14:55.290
Jeez!

14:58.460 --> 15:03.880
<b>Poke Poke Poke</b>

14:58.750 --> 15:00.460
<i>He really did go to sleep.</i>

15:00.460 --> 15:03.420
<i>I wonder where the real 
Mechamaru actually is.</i>

15:05.120 --> 15:07.380
Mechamaru's real body,

15:07.890 --> 15:09.880
Kokichi Muta, is in the basement here.

15:10.630 --> 15:12.890
Now, it's not like he's suspicious.

15:12.890 --> 15:15.010
It's more that everyone else wasn't.

15:15.010 --> 15:17.400
So the process of elimination 
leaves us with him.

15:30.820 --> 15:33.930
Mechamaru's technique 
is puppet manipulation.

15:33.930 --> 15:35.620
Thanks to his Heavenly Pact,

15:35.620 --> 15:38.500
the range he can manipulate puppets 
in extends throughout all of Japan.

15:38.900 --> 15:40.960
If he had unregistered puppets,

15:40.960 --> 15:44.170
he could do the work of a
mole as much as he wanted.

15:44.170 --> 15:45.500
Really?

15:45.500 --> 15:47.670
That guy stood out a lot to me.

15:48.130 --> 15:51.090
Even if the puppet was 
the size of a fly or a mosquito?

15:51.380 --> 15:52.430
I see.

15:52.430 --> 15:54.220
So those are options, too, huh?

15:56.760 --> 15:57.680
We're here.

16:01.350 --> 16:02.730
They've arrived?

16:17.880 --> 16:19.660
Uh...

16:20.740 --> 16:22.750
He got us.

16:22.750 --> 16:24.170
But on the other hand...

16:24.170 --> 16:26.880
Now we're certain it's Mechamaru.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.470
You're late.

16:35.470 --> 16:37.640
I thought you forgot about me.

16:38.050 --> 16:39.890
We wouldn't make a blunder like that.

16:40.270 --> 16:43.890
You're personally familiar with the 
terrifying nature of a pact, right?

16:44.390 --> 16:47.440
He always smells moldy. I hate it.

16:48.020 --> 16:51.110
And he's an enemy. Let's just kill him quick.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.700
You can't do that yet, Mahito.

16:54.650 --> 16:57.870
He agreed to cooperate with us 
and provide information.

16:58.580 --> 17:02.620
In exchange, we agreed to use your 
Idle Transfiguration to fix his body.

17:03.460 --> 17:07.000
That's the pact we all forged, remember?

17:08.250 --> 17:10.750
Killing him comes after fixing him.

17:13.130 --> 17:16.050
I wanted him to do some work 
for us in Shibuya, too,

17:16.050 --> 17:17.550
so that's a shame.

17:18.010 --> 17:20.760
"We won't lay a hand on the people 
from the Kyoto school."

17:20.760 --> 17:23.890
You're the ones who broke our pact first.

17:23.890 --> 17:26.100
Hanami's the one who did that.

17:26.100 --> 17:29.020
You shouldn't lash out at the wrong people.

17:29.020 --> 17:31.230
I have no intention of 
arguing with cursed spirits.

17:31.230 --> 17:33.900
Hurry up and fix me, scumbag.

17:36.200 --> 17:39.450
Maybe I'll get carried away 
and turn him into a caterpillar.

17:39.450 --> 17:40.450
Mahito.

17:40.450 --> 17:45.680
Pacts forged with others are very different 
from pacts placed upon oneself.

17:46.160 --> 17:50.170
The first aspect of that is the 
uncertain nature of the penalty.

17:50.860 --> 17:53.710
If you break a pact with yourself, 
whatever you gained,

17:53.710 --> 17:57.880
the improvement to your own ability is lost,

17:57.880 --> 17:59.840
but this time, you can't break it.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.550
If you break this pact,

18:01.550 --> 18:05.920
then we have no idea when or 
what kind of disaster will befall us.

18:06.300 --> 18:07.990
Yeah, yeah.

18:08.690 --> 18:11.610
You're lower than a scumbag, so be grateful.

18:13.900 --> 18:15.440
Idle Transfiguration.

18:46.680 --> 18:48.600
No fun at all.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.270
Celebrate a bit more.

18:52.420 --> 18:55.230
I'll do that after I'm finished here.

18:56.850 --> 18:58.400
I suppose that's fair.

18:59.240 --> 19:01.770
All right, shall we get started?

19:11.180 --> 19:12.250
Want my help?

19:12.250 --> 19:14.880
Don't you dare. He's my toy.

19:44.620 --> 19:46.330
He escaped?

19:47.200 --> 19:50.410
Well, it's not like <i>we</i> need to kill him.

19:50.870 --> 19:52.580
How boring.

19:53.090 --> 19:56.540
I wanted to have a match, 
not go hunting, you know.

20:13.300 --> 20:15.190
That's more like it!

20:20.010 --> 20:22.990
<b>Ultimate Mechamaru, Mode: Absolute
“Armored Puppet Ultimate Mechamaru Prototype 0”</b>

20:23.330 --> 20:26.070
So you've been making 
something like this in secret?

20:26.070 --> 20:29.100
Guess you weren't a shut-in just for show.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.160
<i>He's inside it, right?</i>

20:31.160 --> 20:33.620
<i>He wouldn't want me to touch him, after all.</i>

20:33.920 --> 20:35.460
<i>The cockpit...</i>

20:35.960 --> 20:37.880
<i>The seat of his soul...</i>

20:38.210 --> 20:39.460
<i>is the head!</i>

20:39.460 --> 20:41.050
<i>Expansion rate normal.</i>

20:41.050 --> 20:43.010
<i>Perception feedback severed.</i>

20:43.010 --> 20:45.470
Tsk. They lowered a veil.

20:45.470 --> 20:46.890
Must be Geto.

20:47.720 --> 20:49.640
It's not just attempting to trap me inside.

20:50.060 --> 20:52.020
It's cutting off signal, too.

20:53.100 --> 20:56.020
This won't be as easy as 
it was for Satoru Gojo.

20:56.270 --> 21:00.150
<i>That's right. My victory 
condition is Satoru Gojo.</i>

21:00.650 --> 21:04.360
<i>I have to use any means necessary 
to get in contact with Satoru Gojo,</i>

21:04.360 --> 21:06.030
<i>and tell him about the Shibuya plot.</i>

21:06.700 --> 21:08.490
<i>Then I'll have him protect me.</i>

21:08.870 --> 21:12.120
<i>But even if I want to focus on Geto, 
the one who lowered this veil,</i>

21:12.450 --> 21:14.750
<i>Mahito, is too dangerous to ignore.</i>

21:15.080 --> 21:17.290
<i>I'll have to exorcise him first.</i>

21:19.840 --> 21:22.210
<i>Go ahead, don't mind me.</i>

21:23.710 --> 21:25.470
<i>I'm still at a disadvantage.</i>

21:25.470 --> 21:28.340
<i>But I have a chance to win.</i>

21:34.700 --> 21:36.560
<i>I've seen it all.</i>

21:37.730 --> 21:41.980
<i>I have all the time I was bound. All the 
cursed energy I gained from that time.</i>

21:42.820 --> 21:44.490
<i>I won't hold anything back.</i>

21:48.490 --> 21:51.490
17 years 1 month 29 days

21:51.490 --> 21:52.490
16 Years

21:52.490 --> 21:54.600
Charge, one year!

21:54.600 --> 21:57.290
Burn him, Mechamaru!

22:00.250 --> 22:02.750
Ultra Cannon!

23:40.650 --> 23:43.860
I decided I'd never tell anyone about 
the things I truly want to keep secret

23:43.860 --> 23:46.230
after I wrote what type of 
boy I like in my profile book

23:46.230 --> 23:48.560
back in grade school 
and had everyone find out!

23:48.560 --> 23:50.320

23:52.650 --> 23:54.540
He does seem like he'd be fast.
