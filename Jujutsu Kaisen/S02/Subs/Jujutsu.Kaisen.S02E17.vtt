00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:04.087
<i>Yuji.</i>

2
00:00:07.257 --> 00:00:09.718
You are strong enough to save others.

3
00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:25.650
{\an8}23:05 DOGENZAKA. IN FRONT OF SHIBUYA 109

4
00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.611
{\an8}My Ten Shadows Technique

5
00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:32.699
can only get two Divine Dogs at first.

6
00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:35.410
If I want to use other Shikigami.

7
00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:38.496
I must exorcise them first.

8
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.878
{\an8}I can only acquire all ten Shikigami

9
00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.300
{\an8}by repeating the exorcism process.

10
00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:55.638
{\an8}Are you finished?

11
00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:59.059
Like the girl just now.

12
00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:02.145
you are very young. yet very strong.

13
00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.024
You're seriously injured.
and still managed not to let me get close.

14
00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:10.528
But with all that bleeding.
even if I don't do anything...

15
00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:16.701
You can exorcise a Shikigami

16
00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:19.788
with multiple people.

17
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:23.583
{\an8}However. the exorcism carried out
by multiple people

18
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.752
{\an8}will become invalid afterward.

19
00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:29.172
{\an8}In other words. for the sorcerer.

20
00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.925
{\an8}that ritual is meaningless.

21
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:34.052
{\an8}But.

22
00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.847
{\an8}even if it's meaningless.
it still can be useful.

23
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.145
{\an8}Who's there making such a fuss?

24
00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:47.023
{\an8}I haven't finished yet.

25
00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:53.947
{\an8}So. although a Shikigami
can't be used unless I exorcise it.

26
00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:59.119
{\an8}if it's for the ritual.
I can summon them anytime.

27
00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:00.703
Could it be...

28
00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:05.917
Not a single sorcerer

29
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.420
has ever been able to exorcise this one.

30
00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:14.384
Do you know why the Gojo family
and the Zenin family don't get along?

31
00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:17.679
They're not on good terms?

32
00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:20.348
Not at all.

33
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:22.767
It was in the Edo period.
or maybe the Keicho era.

34
00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:24.811
I forgot.

35
00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:30.150
<i>The heads of the families
had a duel before the aristocracy.</i>

36
00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:31.401
<i>and both died.</i>

37
00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.320
The heads at that time were...

38
00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:36.322
Just like me.

39
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.659
A Limitless Cursed Technique user
with the Six Eyes.

40
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.913
And. the technique
of the other side was the same as yours.

41
00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:47.876
Ten Shadows Technique.

42
00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:53.548
{\an8}You know what I'm trying to say. right?

43
00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:55.550
{\an8}<i>That doesn't mean</i>

44
00:02:56.217 --> 00:02:58.595
{\an8}<i>I can become a sorcerer
who can defeat you.</i>

45
00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:04.726
<i>The head at that time
must have used it like this too.</i>

46
00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:08.396
<i>Furube.</i>

47
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.315
<i>Yurayura.</i>

48
00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:15.862
Lord Sukuna.

49
00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:17.113
I have urgent matters.

50
00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:18.907
I see.

51
00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:23.661
I will soon regain my freedom.

52
00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:27.123
Do not neglect preparation.

53
00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:29.334
See you later. Uraume.

54
00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:30.418
Yes.

55
00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.421
I shall be waiting for you.

56
00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:52.357
<i>He got me.</i>

57
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.943
<i>It's a ritual.</i>

58
00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:59.113
<i>He started it and made me to take part.</i>

59
00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:01.699
<i>Eight-Handled Sword</i>

60
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.118
<i>Divergent Sila Divine General</i>

61
00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:06.204
<i>Mahoraga.</i>

62
00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:19.550
<i>See you later.</i>

63
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:20.885
<i>Right.</i>

64
00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:23.805
<i>Sorry. Itadori.</i>

65
00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.891
Hey. jerk.

66
00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:31.229
I'm going to die first. Good luck.

67
00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:47.161
Hold on...

68
00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:49.247
Are you kidding? This is...

69
00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:51.541
Damn it...

70
00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:54.252
Get up. you damn sorcerer!

71
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.965
<i>The technique
of curse user Haruta Shigemo is</i>

72
00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:04.512
<i>to erase little everyday miracles
from his memory and store them.</i>

73
00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:08.057
<i>The stored miracles
will manifest as patterns around his eyes</i>

74
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:11.894
<i>and be released
when his life is in danger..</i>

75
00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:21.696
<i>But he does not know this.</i>

76
00:05:29.912 --> 00:05:31.414
<i>Suspended animation. huh?</i>

77
00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.459
<i>I see.</i>

78
00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:38.713
{\an8}<i>So it was a good idea
to save this piece of trash.</i>

79
00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:43.593
<i>He was probably dragged
into the exorcism ritual.</i>

80
00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:47.055
<i>Once he dies. the ritual will end.</i>

81
00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:50.058
<i>And Megumi Fushiguro will also die.</i>

82
00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:52.518
You can't die.

83
00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:56.481
I have a job for you.

84
00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:59.817
Well... I...

85
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:00.902
Shut up.

86
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:06.240
<i>In order to save Megumi Fushiguro's life.</i>

87
00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:08.618
<i>the Shikigami must be taken
down by me. an outsider.</i>

88
00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:13.122
<i>That would invalidate the exorcism ritual.</i>

89
00:06:17.418 --> 00:06:18.252
Let me

90
00:06:18.836 --> 00:06:20.671
have a taste.

91
00:06:54.038 --> 00:06:55.456
Dismantle.

92
00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:12.682
<i>That blade...</i>

93
00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:16.227
<i>Is that the Sword of Extermination
specialized for cursed spirits?</i>

94
00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:20.857
<i>It's like Reverse Cursed Technique
and carries positive energy.</i>

95
00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.735
<i>If I were a cursed spirit.</i>

96
00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:27.822
<i>I would've vanished with the first strike.</i>

97
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.617
Tastes terrible.

98
00:07:42.336 --> 00:07:43.254
Come on!

99
00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.299
You've done something.

100
00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:03.477
That felt strange.

101
00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:27.877
Again?

102
00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:24.600
<i>Cursed energy?!</i>

103
00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:28.729
You're really something.

104
00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:04.849
You can see

105
00:12:05.349 --> 00:12:06.767
my technique. right?

106
00:14:17.815 --> 00:14:19.191
As expected.

107
00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:21.986
it's something similar
to <i>Yamata no Orochi</i>.

108
00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:24.738
<i>It saw through my slash</i>

109
00:14:24.822 --> 00:14:27.491
<i>and attacked with cursed energy.</i>

110
00:14:28.075 --> 00:14:30.995
<i>Both happened after that wheel turned.</i>

111
00:14:31.954 --> 00:14:34.206
<i>Furu's Incantation and that wheel</i>

112
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.084
<i>represent a complete cycle and harmony.</i>

113
00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:41.505
<i>From this. I infer that
the Shikigami's ability is</i>

114
00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:44.341
<i>to adapt to all phenomena.</i>

115
00:14:44.425 --> 00:14:46.635
<i>Kind of like cheating
at rock-paper-scissors.</i>

116
00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:51.015
<i>If it were me back then.</i>

117
00:14:51.098 --> 00:14:53.601
<i>I may have been defeated.</i>

118
00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:02.526
Megumi Fushiguro. you've fascinated me!

119
00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:07.281
Domain Expansion.

120
00:15:09.366 --> 00:15:10.951
Malevolent Shrine.

121
00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:21.587
<i>Sukuna's domain. Malevolent Shrine.</i>

122
00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:24.173
<i>is unlike other domains.</i>

123
00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:27.676
<i>It does not separate space with a barrier
or close the barrier itself.</i>

124
00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:31.680
<i>but makes the Innate Domain visible.</i>

125
00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:36.435
<i>It's like not using a canvas.
but rather painting directly in the sky.</i>

126
00:15:37.478 --> 00:15:39.563
<i>An unimaginable skill.</i>

127
00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:45.027
<i>In addition. a Binding Vow is formed
by allowing opponents to escape.</i>

128
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:51.116
<i>It increases the range of guaranteed hit
to a maximum radius of 200 meters.</i>

129
00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:56.038
<i>Considering the effect
on Megumi Fushiguro.</i>

130
00:15:56.121 --> 00:16:01.710
<i>Sukuna narrowed the range
to a 140-meter radius. on the ground.</i>

131
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:10.052
How is it?

132
00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:11.553
No. no signal.

133
00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:12.471
Me neither.

134
00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:16.225
But I don't think
we need to be too worried.

135
00:16:17.851 --> 00:16:19.561
There was that megaphone guy...

136
00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:25.818
<i>Sukuna has two types of slash attacks.</i>

137
00:16:25.901 --> 00:16:30.489
<i>Cleave for those with cursed energy
within the guaranteed hit range.</i>

138
00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:33.492
<i>and Dismantle for those
without cursed energy.</i>

139
00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:35.995
<i>Until Malevolent Shrine disappears.</i>

140
00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:37.997
<i>all targets will be attacked relentlessly.</i>

141
00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:42.751
<i>This is the only way to break Mahoraga.</i>

142
00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:47.089
<i>Use a technique alien to the opponent
and kill him before he can adapt.</i>

143
00:16:48.424 --> 00:16:50.509
<i>Cleave fits this requirement.</i>

144
00:16:50.592 --> 00:16:56.015
<i>But if he hasn't adapted to Dismantle.
but to all slash attacks...</i>

145
00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:59.184
<i>it will be a different story.</i>

146
00:17:18.203 --> 00:17:21.707
<i>The regeneration of Mahoraga
is about to complete.</i>

147
00:17:50.402 --> 00:17:51.403
<i>Open.</i>

148
00:18:43.997 --> 00:18:45.332
What are you looking at?

149
00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:47.584
Get lost.

150
00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:56.635
Well... I'll excuse myself then.

151
00:18:57.219 --> 00:18:58.887
<i>I'm indeed very lucky.</i>

152
00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:00.889
<i>Today.</i>

153
00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:03.767
<i>I've escaped death again...</i>

154
00:19:05.102 --> 00:19:07.604
<i>The miracles Shigemo stored</i>

155
00:19:07.688 --> 00:19:11.525
<i>had been exhausted
in his battle with Kento Nanami.</i>

156
00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:17.156
It's almost time.

157
00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:21.827
Fushiguro.

158
00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:25.747
<i>I thought I just saw Itadori for a moment.</i>

159
00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:29.293
{\an8}<i>No. was it Sukuna?</i>

160
00:19:29.376 --> 00:19:32.421
{\an8}23:14 DOGENZAKA. IN FRONT OF SHIBUYA 109

161
00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.885
Kid.

162
00:19:37.968 --> 00:19:40.137
Enjoy it while you can.

163
00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:26.767
Die.

164
00:20:28.143 --> 00:20:31.980
Only me...

165
00:20:33.148 --> 00:20:34.233
Die!

166
00:20:35.984 --> 00:20:37.152
Die now!

167
00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:38.422
I have to go.

168
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:41.758
I must fight.

169
00:21:51.018 --> 00:21:52.686
{\an8}<i>Otherwise I'm nothing...</i>

170
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:56.732
<i>but a murderer.</i>

171
00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:55.767
<i>Things are getting out of hand.</i>

172
00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:57.936
<i>Let's count prime numbers to calm down.</i>

173
00:23:58.019 --> 00:24:01.106
<i>One. two. three... um. nine?</i>

174
00:24:01.189 --> 00:24:02.399
<i>Five. seven.</i>

175
00:24:02.482 --> 00:24:03.859
<i>Next episode. Right and Wrong.</i>

176
00:24:03.942 --> 00:24:05.610
<i>I'll become a polar bear
if you don't watch.</i>

177
00:24:05.694 --> 00:24:07.362
<i>Same difference.</i>
