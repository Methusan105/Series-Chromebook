1
00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:33.158
Try harder. Itadori!

2
00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:37.412
{\an8}This is the last time we curse each other!

3
00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:45.170
Hey. are you trying to exclude me?

4
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:04.647
<i>He cut himself.</i>

5
00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:28.171
Soul Multiplicity.

6
00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:34.719
Numerous souls with a weak repulsion
response intermixed and turned into flesh.

7
00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.639
Polymorphic Soul Isomer!

8
00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:40.391
<i>That transfigured human is...</i>

9
00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:57.117
<i>Since he's strong enough
to stop me and my brother.</i>

10
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.911
<i>the proportion of his power
after splitting is probably</i>

11
00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:01.329
<i>2 to 8.</i>

12
00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:10.130
<i>And the smaller proportion
indicates the main body.</i>

13
00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:13.508
<i>I can leave that to my brother.
He can handle it.</i>

14
00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:18.221
<i>I heard the grade of transfigured humans</i>

15
00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:20.932
<i>is about Grade 3 to Grade 2.</i>

16
00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:24.018
<i>Quickly finish him. Aoi Todo!</i>

17
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.314
<i>What?</i>

18
00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:29.524
Todo!

19
00:02:31.192 --> 00:02:32.569
You underestimated me!

20
00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:03.182
<i>He was dead.</i>

21
00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:06.436
<i>He was so strong.</i>

22
00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.104
<i>yet he died from a single blow.</i>

23
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.110
<i>I see.</i>

24
00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:18.114
<i>He let several souls
to burn out in an instant</i>

25
00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:21.159
<i>to obtain explosive power?</i>

26
00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:25.204
<i>Super offensive transfigured human. and...</i>

27
00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:27.999
<i>There are two more.</i>

28
00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:39.260
Forgive me. poor souls.

29
00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:20.611
I separated him from Todo.

30
00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:21.654
That's exactly

31
00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:23.406
what I want!

32
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.814
It seems

33
00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:40.983
you really want to exclude me completely.

34
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:45.822
<i>Two Polymorphic Soul Isomers
couldn't kill him?</i>

35
00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:52.620
<i>It seems quite hard to hit him.</i>

36
00:06:53.162 --> 00:06:56.165
<i>But if I expand my domain.</i>

37
00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:02.630
<i>I will encounter Sukuna
and get killed by him.</i>

38
00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:05.758
<i>Barrier techniques are complex.</i>

39
00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:09.095
<i>Itadori knows that I once expanded
a domain that excluded him.</i>

40
00:07:09.887 --> 00:07:12.181
<i>Repeating the same trick
on him probably won't work.</i>

41
00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:15.393
<i>What should I do?</i>

42
00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:17.895
<i>The person who taught me this trick was...</i>

43
00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:22.650
Domain Expansion.

44
00:07:24.318 --> 00:07:26.863
Self-Embodiment of Perfection!

45
00:07:28.489 --> 00:07:30.491
<i>That's practically suicide.</i>

46
00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:32.910
<i>Let's take a gamble.</i>

47
00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:36.164
<i>0.2 seconds of Domain Expansion.</i>

48
00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:43.796
<i>Todo expanded the Simple Domain
that Yuki Tsukumo taught him</i>

49
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.548
<i>to protect himself from the domain.</i>

50
00:07:48.384 --> 00:07:51.053
<i>Itadori was faster.
and he sprinted forward.</i>

51
00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:54.265
<i>attempting to exorcise Mahito before
the release of Idle Transfiguration.</i>

52
00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:59.937
<i>However. Mahito launched
the technique faster than Itadori.</i>

53
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:03.107
<i>The materialization of Innate Domain
and the activation of the technique</i>

54
00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:06.152
<i>combined the project
of two stages into one.</i>

55
00:08:06.235 --> 00:08:08.321
<i>Experiencing Black Flash
and being in an awakened state</i>

56
00:08:08.404 --> 00:08:10.156
<i>enabled him to act so fast.</i>

57
00:08:13.784 --> 00:08:17.455
Sukuna. did I pass safely?

58
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.917
For someone like you.

59
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.794
you must have set up a barrier
between you and Itadori.

60
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:26.255
You won't succeed.

61
00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:29.300
I'll kill him before you switch with him.

62
00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:31.969
Just stay here and watch.

63
00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:54.116
Todo!

64
00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:01.249
What's the matter?

65
00:09:01.832 --> 00:09:03.626
I deliberately made it prettier for you.

66
00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:05.753
<i>After the Domain Expansion.</i>

67
00:09:05.836 --> 00:09:11.008
<i>the technique etched on the body
will become difficult to use.</i>

68
00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:16.180
<i>Mahito realized this when he escaped
from Satosakura High School.</i>

69
00:09:18.599 --> 00:09:20.476
Black Flash!

70
00:09:23.604 --> 00:09:24.772
<i>This guy...</i>

71
00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:29.110
<i>He instinctively concentrated
all his cursed energy in his abdomen.</i>

72
00:09:35.366 --> 00:09:37.994
<i>But the technique has already recovered.</i>

73
00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:39.537
<i>And he can't clap.</i>

74
00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:42.790
<i>This time I can definitely kill him!</i>

75
00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:57.930
<i>At first sight. my heart fluttered</i>

76
00:09:58.014 --> 00:10:02.143
<i>No matter how far
I jump high into the sky</i>

77
00:10:02.226 --> 00:10:03.436
<i>Flying to your side...</i>

78
00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:05.688
A PICTURE OF TODO'S IMAGINATION
TAKADA-CHAN "CLIMAXâ˜†JUMPING!"

79
00:10:08.649 --> 00:10:14.196
<i>Look. courage sprouted in my chest</i>

80
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:19.201
<i>I stand up bravely with resolve</i>

81
00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:24.123
<i>Want to move forward step by step</i>

82
00:10:24.206 --> 00:10:27.710
<i>Achieve! My own wish!</i>

83
00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:31.047
<i>Try stepping out of the comfort zone</i>

84
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.424
<i>To a place I've never been</i>

85
00:10:33.507 --> 00:10:34.800
<i>Tantakata~n</i>

86
00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:38.346
<i>I can't suppress the thumping of my heart</i>

87
00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:40.681
<i>It encourages me to move on</i>

88
00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:43.934
<i>Although I'm still scared</i>

89
00:10:44.018 --> 00:10:46.187
<i>The voice inside tells me</i>

90
00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:50.608
<i>I want to convey it. I want to keep going</i>

91
00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:54.654
<i>I won't forget at any time or place</i>

92
00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:57.239
<i>The unique feeling in the world...</i>

93
00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:58.199
Oh no.

94
00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:01.869
Black Flash!

95
00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.835
<i>He still touched me for a moment.</i>

96
00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:13.089
<i>It's a miracle to only have
such a slight injury.</i>

97
00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:27.978
Leave the rest to me. Todo.

98
00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:31.065
Thank you. Todo!

99
00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:34.318
<i>Damn!</i>

100
00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:37.613
<i>I got hit directly
by Black Flash at this time.</i>

101
00:11:37.696 --> 00:11:40.950
<i>Todo was messing around till the very end.</i>

102
00:11:41.575 --> 00:11:43.953
<i>But I've finally grasped</i>

103
00:11:44.036 --> 00:11:46.914
<i>the essence of my soul.</i>

104
00:11:46.997 --> 00:11:48.958
<i>and its true form.</i>

105
00:11:50.167 --> 00:11:51.961
Idle Transfiguration.

106
00:12:05.182 --> 00:12:07.476
Instant Spirit Body of Distorted Killing.

107
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.896
{\an8}Time to say happy birthday.

108
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:12.982
Itadori.

109
00:12:14.817 --> 00:12:18.154
<i>This is different from
those transformations used as means.</i>

110
00:12:19.947 --> 00:12:21.240
<i>What's the difference?</i>

111
00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.577
After experiencing Black Flash.

112
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.414
I finally understood my true soul.

113
00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:30.332
That's unexpected.

114
00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:33.210
Didn't expect you to be the type
to find your life purpose.

115
00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:35.838
Yeah.

116
00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:39.008
But I'm just beginning to wrap things up.

117
00:12:39.508 --> 00:12:41.343
After I kill you.

118
00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:44.680
I will truly be born into this world.

119
00:13:25.137 --> 00:13:27.806
<i>So hard. His body</i>

120
00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:29.350
<i>is even harder now.</i>

121
00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:51.205
After experiencing Black Flash.

122
00:13:51.288 --> 00:13:55.000
I finally understood my true soul.

123
00:13:55.584 --> 00:13:57.211
<i>So that's how it is.</i>

124
00:14:05.886 --> 00:14:07.638
<i>This guy...</i>

125
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.859
<i>In terms of cursed spirit.</i>

126
00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:23.654
<i>he has become totally different compared
with the one before the transformation.</i>

127
00:14:55.477 --> 00:14:57.813
<i>To defeat him.</i>

128
00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:03.152
<i>I can only activate Black Flash
with maximum cursed energy and hit him.</i>

129
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:07.031
<i>This is the only way.</i>

130
00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.131
<i>It's only for a moment.</i>

131
00:15:24.214 --> 00:15:28.886
<i>but the Black Flash I took
after Domain Expansion indeed has effects.</i>

132
00:15:43.692 --> 00:15:45.194
It seems that we

133
00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:48.656
are still full of vitality!

134
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.725
<i>No one can consciously unleash
Black Flash.</i>

135
00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:19.311
<i>But the current Itadori</i>

136
00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:22.106
<i>makes one feel he can freely unleash it.</i>

137
00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:25.192
<i>In that case...</i>

138
00:16:54.888 --> 00:16:56.515
<i>He used the time difference.</i>

139
00:17:08.652 --> 00:17:12.156
<i>Cursed spirit.
there is something you don't know.</i>

140
00:17:14.074 --> 00:17:16.243
The wrist is just for a pose.

141
00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:20.205
The so-called clap is the cheer

142
00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:22.458
of souls.

143
00:17:25.419 --> 00:17:28.338
{\an8}<i>No position switch?</i>

144
00:17:28.422 --> 00:17:29.965
{\an8}Unfortunately.

145
00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:34.970
my "Boogie Woogie" is dead.

146
00:17:45.981 --> 00:17:48.025
Black flash!

147
00:18:19.973 --> 00:18:22.643
Not yet.

148
00:18:28.315 --> 00:18:31.026
{\an8}<i>The stock of my transfigured humans...</i>

149
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.362
I admit it. Mahito.

150
00:18:35.989 --> 00:18:37.157
I am you.

151
00:18:38.867 --> 00:18:40.786
I've always wanted to deny you.

152
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.373
I didn't want to agree with what you said.

153
00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:47.793
But now it's different.

154
00:18:48.877 --> 00:18:50.546
I just want to kill you.

155
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.549
If you are born again as a new curse.

156
00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:55.050
I will kill that guy too.

157
00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:57.803
{\an8}Even if you change your name and look.

158
00:18:57.886 --> 00:18:59.304
{\an8}I will kill you. no matter how many times.

159
00:19:00.222 --> 00:19:02.307
There's no need for meaning or reason.

160
00:19:03.058 --> 00:19:05.269
Perhaps this act

161
00:19:06.186 --> 00:19:09.565
will only become meaningful
centuries after I'm dead.

162
00:19:10.732 --> 00:19:12.901
I guess I must be only

163
00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:16.071
a gear of some great thing.

164
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:19.992
I will keep killing curses
before I get rusty.

165
00:19:21.076 --> 00:19:21.994
This is

166
00:19:23.453 --> 00:19:25.581
my mission in this war.

167
00:21:42.509 --> 00:21:44.428
{\an8}Geto!

168
00:21:45.178 --> 00:21:47.931
Do you need me to save you. Mahito?

169
00:23:21.483 --> 00:23:24.486
<i>An arranged fate
may not be considered fate.</i>

170
00:23:24.569 --> 00:23:25.570
<i>However.</i>

171
00:23:25.654 --> 00:23:28.115
<i>in the moment when false fates intertwine.</i>

172
00:23:28.198 --> 00:23:30.617
<i>it becomes a kind of fate.</i>

173
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.869
<i>Next Episode. "Metamorphosis Part 2."</i>

174
00:23:32.953 --> 00:23:35.539
<i>Some things flourish
within the gilded layers.</i>
