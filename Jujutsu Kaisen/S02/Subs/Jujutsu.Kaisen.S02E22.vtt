1
00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:11.803
{\an8}11:28 P.M.. IN FRONT OF SHIBUYA STREAM

2
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.701
Kusakabe.

3
00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:40.540
Hey. Kusakabe!

4
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.341
Found you.

5
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.766
Panda. it's nothing like
what you've told me.

6
00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:58.683
Huh?

7
00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:00.852
I mean Itadori.

8
00:01:01.352 --> 00:01:03.021
No. that's Sukuna...

9
00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:05.899
Itadori holds dominance over his body.

10
00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.110
You just said that.

11
00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:15.116
Let me speak frankly.

12
00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:17.952
Now that Gojo has disappeared.

13
00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:20.872
no matter how Itadori will be punished.

14
00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:23.958
I won't side with you.

15
00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:32.675
I agree to execute Yuji Itadori.

16
00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:38.056
{\an8}10:36 P.M.. LOCAL TIME
KUALA LUMPUR. MALAYSIA

17
00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.062
I'm truly sorry.

18
00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:47.315
You must be exhausted. Ui Ui.

19
00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:51.319
Let's share the bed today.

20
00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:54.656
But this is so inappropriate.

21
00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:58.743
Do you dislike me being inappropriate?

22
00:01:58.827 --> 00:01:59.828
Of course not...

23
00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:03.331
Sorry. someone is calling me back.

24
00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:05.583
Oh. you are so bad.

25
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.129
Sorry to bother you at night.

26
00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.674
Ah. I forgot it's morning over there.

27
00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:16.386
Me? I'm in KL.

28
00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:20.640
Yes. I used Ui Ui's technique.

29
00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:23.393
I nearly got killed.

30
00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.524
I advise you to sell all Japanese stocks
and real estate in Tokyo.

31
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:32.485
I have even exchanged all my money.

32
00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:36.197
Yes. it's urgent.

33
00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:41.536
Major developed countries will
inevitably be affected negatively.

34
00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:46.791
No matter what. Japan still has
the world's third-largest economy.

35
00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:50.712
Anyway. it's up to you.

36
00:02:52.046 --> 00:02:54.007
Don't thank me.

37
00:02:54.716 --> 00:02:57.135
Just stay in there as usual.

38
00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:03.683
I'm looking forward to our cooperation.

39
00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:11.733
What's wrong? Feeling unwell?

40
00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:25.163
{\an8}11:28 P.M.. SHIBUYA STATION
B3. DENEN-TOSHI LINE PLATFORM

41
00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:26.456
{\an8}I must go.

42
00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:31.377
Yuji Itadori...

43
00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.671
Who exactly are you?

44
00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:38.593
I must figure it out.

45
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.471
What...

46
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.016
am I?

47
00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:49.312
Do you need my help?

48
00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:50.605
{\an8}Mahito.

49
00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:52.315
{\an8}11:36 P.M.. SHIBUYA POLICE STATION
SITE OF UDAGAWA POLICE STATION

50
00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:02.700
<i>He just called him "Geto."</i>

51
00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:04.619
Give him back.

52
00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.206
Give Mr. Gojo back!

53
00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:11.960
Seeing catfish as a monster
associated with earthquakes

54
00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.921
is a folktale from the mid-Edo era.

55
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.882
People at that time believed

56
00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:20.843
movement from the "giant catfish"
underground will trigger an earthquake.

57
00:04:32.146 --> 00:04:33.690
What just happened?

58
00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.151
You thought you were falling. right?

59
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.532
But in others' eyes. you just tripped.

60
00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.912
The advantage of Cursed Spirit
Manipulation is its endless tactics.

61
00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:51.749
It can command various Cursed Spirits
of Semi-Grade 1 or higher.

62
00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:55.712
Even if one is seen through or broken.

63
00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:58.256
you can just release a new Cursed Spirit.

64
00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:03.678
You can also launch all of them at once.

65
00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:14.522
This thing...

66
00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:24.157
At the Night Line of
a Hundred Demons last year.

67
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.201
if he hadn't spread forces
to Shinjuku and Kyoto.

68
00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:30.997
perhaps he would've won. and not Okkotsu.

69
00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:35.585
But this has nothing to do with you.

70
00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:39.672
Give him back.

71
00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:43.134
Even I have to admire it.

72
00:05:43.217 --> 00:05:46.512
Sukuna's vessel is really tough.

73
00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:51.934
I've always known it.

74
00:05:52.643 --> 00:05:53.728
Because I was...

75
00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:57.815
born from you humans.

76
00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:37.897
Let's continue.

77
00:06:40.441 --> 00:06:42.944
Let's talk about the future of the world.

78
00:08:19.123 --> 00:08:22.001
Do you know what Maximum is?

79
00:08:25.963 --> 00:08:30.259
{\an8}That is equivalent to the essence
of techniques. apart from the "Domain."

80
00:08:33.971 --> 00:08:37.225
Cursed Spirit Manipulation:
Maximum Uzumaki.

81
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.228
It combines absorbed
Cursed Spirits into one.

82
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:43.523
forming an ultra-dense mass of
Cursed Energy to attack the opponent.

83
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.867
What's so funny?

84
00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:57.411
Sorry. nothing.

85
00:08:58.037 --> 00:09:01.624
I just thought that I now
behave just like him.

86
00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:04.210
We were talking about "Uzumaki". right?

87
00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.171
"Uzumaki" is indeed strong.

88
00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:09.549
but it gives up the advantage
of Cursed Spirit Manipulation.

89
00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:11.884
That is. it gives up
the diversity of attacks.

90
00:09:12.468 --> 00:09:15.346
So I initially had little interest in it.

91
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:20.184
I thought it was just recycling
low-grade Cursed Spirits for future use.

92
00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:27.275
But I was wrong.

93
00:09:27.775 --> 00:09:29.026
Uzumaki's true value

94
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:33.281
is only manifested when using
Semi-Grade 1 or higher cursed spirits.

95
00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:35.157
Which is...

96
00:09:36.033 --> 00:09:37.034
Extraction of techniques.

97
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.590
How foolish.

98
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.759
Do you think I can't sense

99
00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:56.554
the presence you can sense?

100
00:10:01.517 --> 00:10:03.436
<i>A signal. The target is...</i>

101
00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:05.396
<i>right below Nishimiya!</i>

102
00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:30.254
A sniper rifle? Nice.

103
00:10:31.088 --> 00:10:33.633
I also think that
when dealing with Sorcerers.

104
00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:37.470
one should actively use
conventional weapons.

105
00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:41.432
<i>When I was the captain of
a children's basketball team.</i>

106
00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:45.102
<i>my mom often dyed my hair black.</i>

107
00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:48.314
<i>Later in junior high. I met my master.</i>

108
00:10:48.397 --> 00:10:50.107
<i>Let alone a real sword.</i>

109
00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:52.610
<i>I had never held a wooden or bamboo sword.</i>

110
00:10:52.693 --> 00:10:54.862
<i>Yet I still chose to become
a Jujutsu Sorcerer.</i>

111
00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:58.366
<i>I keep swinging the sword.</i>

112
00:10:58.949 --> 00:11:01.452
<i>because I don't want to
become a burden to my mom.</i>

113
00:11:03.412 --> 00:11:05.748
<i>I keep swinging the sword...</i>

114
00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:11.295
<i>because I don't want to die.</i>

115
00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:13.881
New Shadow Style...

116
00:11:13.964 --> 00:11:15.424
<i>This sword...</i>

117
00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:17.968
<i>carries everything in the past</i>

118
00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:19.845
<i>and in the future.</i>

119
00:11:20.888 --> 00:11:24.058
<i>Even if I can no longer wield
a sword. I won't regret it.</i>

120
00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:26.394
"Quick Draw"!

121
00:11:39.448 --> 00:11:40.616
Maximum...

122
00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:45.287
"Uzumaki."

123
00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:48.749
Wait!

124
00:12:10.604 --> 00:12:14.024
New Shadow? That's great.

125
00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:17.736
Fortunately. the person
who came isn't bad.

126
00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:25.494
Mr. Kusakabe.

127
00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:28.497
If you come out. it will be pointless.

128
00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.458
It's not my fault!

129
00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.714
Itadori.

130
00:12:36.797 --> 00:12:38.632
You're Itadori now. right?

131
00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:40.718
Senior Panda!

132
00:12:41.218 --> 00:12:42.720
Great.

133
00:12:42.803 --> 00:12:44.513
You are back.

134
00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:47.016
That man who has Satoru Gojo

135
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.351
has the Prison Realm?

136
00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:51.270
It seems so.

137
00:12:51.353 --> 00:12:54.773
What's the fun in carrying
that kind of nuisance around?

138
00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:56.400
Who is he?

139
00:12:56.984 --> 00:12:58.819
He's Suguru Geto on the outside.

140
00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:01.280
I have no idea about the inside.

141
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.464
Hi. Choso.

142
00:13:20.758 --> 00:13:22.051
That guy is...

143
00:13:28.724 --> 00:13:31.185
<i>I have three parents.</i>

144
00:13:31.852 --> 00:13:35.105
<i>Mother. the Cursed Spirit that
made my mother pregnant.</i>

145
00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:37.566
<i>and the one who blended in his own blood</i>

146
00:13:39.026 --> 00:13:43.197
and manipulated my mother. the detestable...

147
00:13:43.739 --> 00:13:45.366
So you've noticed.

148
00:13:46.075 --> 00:13:47.868
So that's how it was.

149
00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:51.372
Noritoshi Kamo!

150
00:13:51.455 --> 00:13:54.208
- Noritoshi...
- ...Kamo?

151
00:13:54.291 --> 00:13:55.501
Me?

152
00:13:56.085 --> 00:13:58.337
What? What does that mean?

153
00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.005
The stain of the Kamo family.

154
00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:01.924
The most evil Sorcerer in history.

155
00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:07.388
If it's really him. the person inside Geto
would be over 150 years old.

156
00:14:08.806 --> 00:14:10.933
<i>An outrageous barrier technique.</i>

157
00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:13.727
<i>with a ludicrous Cursed Tool.</i>

158
00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:18.440
<i>Having a Cursed Technique that
can replace physical bodies.</i>

159
00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:20.776
Suitable to be the mastermind indeed.

160
00:14:21.735 --> 00:14:25.322
Noritoshi Kamo is just
one of my many names.

161
00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:26.740
You can call me whatever you like.

162
00:14:28.242 --> 00:14:29.493
Such audacity.

163
00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:32.162
You dare to deceive me

164
00:14:32.746 --> 00:14:38.085
to kill Itadori... my very own brother?

165
00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:44.675
Get out of the way.

166
00:14:44.758 --> 00:14:46.886
Don't make me wait too long.

167
00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:50.139
Move aside. I am the older brother!

168
00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:06.113
<i>Due to the influence of my technique.</i>

169
00:15:07.114 --> 00:15:09.825
<i>I can sense my brothers' anomalies.</i>

170
00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:12.661
<i>no matter how far away they are.</i>

171
00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:24.340
My brother died.

172
00:15:25.215 --> 00:15:26.508
<i>Death.</i>

173
00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.135
<i>For a living creature.</i>

174
00:15:28.218 --> 00:15:31.138
<i>it's the last and biggest anomaly.</i>

175
00:15:31.805 --> 00:15:33.891
<i>At that time.</i>

176
00:15:33.974 --> 00:15:38.562
<i>I strongly sensed Yuji Itadori's
"death" before my eyes.</i>

177
00:15:40.522 --> 00:15:45.235
<i>In other words.
Yuji is my brother by blood.</i>

178
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:52.034
<i>If Noritoshi Kamo can keep
replacing his body to prolong his life.</i>

179
00:15:52.534 --> 00:15:54.828
<i>then this is not impossible.</i>

180
00:15:56.163 --> 00:15:57.581
In that case...

181
00:15:59.708 --> 00:16:03.003
<i>I will do my utmost to fulfill
my duty as the older brother.</i>

182
00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:05.464
Blood Manipulation?

183
00:16:09.343 --> 00:16:10.886
Such a strong pressure.

184
00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:17.059
<i>So fast.</i>

185
00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:19.520
<i>This is "Piercing Blood."</i>

186
00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:24.770
Don't pretend to be tough.

187
00:18:24.853 --> 00:18:26.480
You must be tired.

188
00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:30.150
So what?

189
00:18:31.568 --> 00:18:36.740
Is that a reason not to fight
to the death for my brother?

190
00:18:40.536 --> 00:18:43.622
Let me confirm if you are related.

191
00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:47.167
Absolutely not.
he almost killed me last time.

192
00:18:47.835 --> 00:18:49.336
Todo considers you a brother too.

193
00:18:49.419 --> 00:18:52.214
Do you emit
some kind of strange pheromone?

194
00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.801
But thanks to his interference.

195
00:18:56.385 --> 00:18:57.719
we can seize this opportunity.

196
00:18:58.303 --> 00:18:59.388
Yeah.

197
00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:02.474
I have two lives left.
so I'll take the lead.

198
00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:05.561
If we attack together.
he will show his flaw. right?

199
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.731
We must take back
Prison Realm by any means.

200
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.949
Drumming Beat...

201
00:19:20.617 --> 00:19:22.035
Ice Formation...

202
00:19:22.786 --> 00:19:24.163
<i>Frost Calm.</i>

203
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.840
<i>It's quite an advanced ice technique.</i>

204
00:19:34.923 --> 00:19:37.968
<i>If you move recklessly.
your body will shatter.</i>

205
00:19:43.223 --> 00:19:44.558
Don't kill him.

206
00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:46.643
We need someone to pass on information.

207
00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:48.979
Is that a reason
to keep all of them alive?

208
00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:54.818
<i>Reverse Cursed Technique.</i>

209
00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:57.905
<i>The scale of the Cursed Technique
far surpasses ours.</i>

210
00:19:57.988 --> 00:19:59.573
<i>I want to go home.</i>

211
00:20:00.574 --> 00:20:02.534
This level of ice is nothing.

212
00:20:03.118 --> 00:20:04.870
Flowing Red Scale.

213
00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:10.584
Which level did you say?

214
00:20:18.842 --> 00:20:20.510
Be clear whose body it is.

215
00:20:20.594 --> 00:20:22.721
<i>Only the ice on me is especially fragile.</i>

216
00:20:22.804 --> 00:20:24.097
<i>It seems she's related to Sukuna.</i>

217
00:20:25.474 --> 00:20:27.142
You are a friend. right?

218
00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:28.101
No.

219
00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:31.521
I am your big brother.

220
00:20:32.105 --> 00:20:34.233
Are you serious?

221
00:20:34.316 --> 00:20:36.985
Can you call me that?

222
00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:38.278
Call me brother.

223
00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:41.698
{\an8}Tool Manipulation...

224
00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:43.992
Wind Scythe!

225
00:20:47.204 --> 00:20:48.205
Damn it.

226
00:20:48.288 --> 00:20:50.707
<i>He blocked it with his bare hands.</i>

227
00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:52.668
Itadori!

228
00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:55.003
We can only act now.

229
00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:58.465
We need to buy time
before Miss Utahime is ready.

230
00:20:59.174 --> 00:21:01.051
The messenger...

231
00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:05.973
can just be Yuji Itadori.

232
00:21:07.307 --> 00:21:10.060
Ice Formation: Icefall!

233
00:21:22.197 --> 00:21:23.448
I'll be killed...

234
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:32.165
Long time no see...

235
00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:33.792
Geto.

236
00:21:36.628 --> 00:21:39.881
You can answer my question
from that time now. right?

237
00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:44.636
What type of woman do you like?

238
00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:49.683
Yuki Tsukumo.

239
00:23:21.733 --> 00:23:24.694
<i>When people's happiness is in conflict.</i>

240
00:23:24.778 --> 00:23:26.363
<i>there will be misery.</i>

241
00:23:26.446 --> 00:23:28.240
<i>But when their misery conflicts.</i>

242
00:23:28.323 --> 00:23:31.076
<i>there will likely be more misery.</i>

243
00:23:31.159 --> 00:23:33.370
<i>Next episode: Shibuya Incident. Close.</i>

244
00:23:33.453 --> 00:23:35.413
<i>Let's use a warmer quilt tonight.</i>
