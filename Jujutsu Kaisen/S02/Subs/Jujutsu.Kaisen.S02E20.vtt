1
00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:14.139
Oh no.

2
00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:17.851
Look what you've done. Kugisaki.

3
00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:20.228
This shirt belongs to Mr. Gojo. right?

4
00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:30.864
<i>Mr. Ijichi handed over the freshly
laundered shirt to us and left.</i>

5
00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:31.948
MR. IJICHI

6
00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.700
And I spilled the coffee.

7
00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:35.452
So who's to blame?

8
00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:36.453
- You.
- You.

9
00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:41.207
- Do it gently.
- I'm doing just that.

10
00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:52.135
It looks like "Marimekko" style.

11
00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.887
Don't underestimate fashion.

12
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.514
Well. it's probably cheap anyway.

13
00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:58.933
Fushiguro. check the brand on the label.

14
00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:10.737
Is tax included?

15
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.531
No. But is that the point?

16
00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:18.536
Fine. I'll give 90.000 yen.

17
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.163
You guys pay 80.000 yen each.

18
00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:22.373
Good morning.

19
00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:24.959
Ijichi said you guys had my shirt...

20
00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.338
What's wrong. Megumi?

21
00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:29.756
Nothing.

22
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.120
{\an8}Kugisaki.

23
00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:11.506
{\an8}No. No.

24
00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:15.510
Kugi...

25
00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:28.022
<i>My ability</i>

26
00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:30.358
<i>is truly terrifying.</i>

27
00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:33.111
I am...

28
00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:35.822
I am the real...

29
00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:37.824
"Curse"!

30
00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:42.078
Black Flash!

31
00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.211
Hey.

32
00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:52.422
You thought you were here

33
00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.508
to kill demons like in fairy tales.

34
00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:01.472
You came with that mindset. right?

35
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.559
Don't be naive. punk!

36
00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:08.021
This is war!

37
00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:11.441
It's not a war to correct mistakes.

38
00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:14.235
but a battle to impose
our self-proclaimed right ideas

39
00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.489
on each other!

40
00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:26.539
You are me. Yuji Itadori.

41
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.547
Just like I kill without thinking.

42
00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:39.761
you save people without thinking.

43
00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:45.016
Our instincts and the dignity
you gained from reason.

44
00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:51.147
This war is about who will remain
a hundred years from now!

45
00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:55.735
You didn't even realize that.

46
00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:58.529
so how could you possibly defeat me?

47
00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:06.454
Hey. Yuji Itadori.

48
00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:10.124
Did you count
how many curses you've killed?

49
00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:15.672
No. I haven't been counting either.

50
00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:20.176
Because it doesn't matter
how many humans I've killed.

51
00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:25.807
It won't be long
before I completely forget you.

52
00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:38.152
The sound of the Gion Shoja bells

53
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.532
echoes the impermanence of all things.

54
00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:46.744
The color of the sala flowers

55
00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:52.000
reveals the truth
the prosperous must decline.

56
00:04:53.584 --> 00:04:55.003
But...

57
00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:01.467
we are the exceptions.

58
00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:38.356
{\an8}TOSHIN METRO SHIBUYA STATION
B5F. SHINTOSHIN LINE PLATFORM

59
00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:39.690
{\an8}These people...

60
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:41.275
{\an8}KYOTO SCHOOL. FIRST YEAR. ARATA NITTA

61
00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:42.610
{\an8}...are still alive?

62
00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:53.329
It seems Suguru Geto
has left with Prison Realm.

63
00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:54.372
How come...

64
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.166
Let's change our mindset.

65
00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:00.670
Instead of fighting to save Satoru Gojo.

66
00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:06.050
we fight to weaken the enemy
in order to save our companions.

67
00:07:06.134 --> 00:07:09.470
Our purpose has completely changed.

68
00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:12.515
Hurry up.

69
00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:15.393
My brother must be nearby.

70
00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:18.521
<i>So he has a brother.</i>

71
00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:20.773
<i>I thought he's an only child.</i>

72
00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:26.821
<i>What happened?</i>

73
00:07:27.738 --> 00:07:29.198
<i>That scar on his face.</i>

74
00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.451
<i>My position was changed.</i>

75
00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:33.953
<i>Is he the sorcerer who killed Hanami?</i>

76
00:07:34.036 --> 00:07:35.204
Mr. Todo.

77
00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.582
I've already provided first aid
to the girl over there.

78
00:07:37.665 --> 00:07:39.876
But she will probably die.

79
00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.420
Please don't blame it on me afterwards.

80
00:07:42.503 --> 00:07:45.465
Enough talking. Help my brother too.

81
00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:47.425
Get up.

82
00:07:47.508 --> 00:07:50.011
Our battle is just beginning.

83
00:07:50.094 --> 00:07:51.220
<i>A jinx.</i>

84
00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:56.058
Todo...

85
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.481
I can't...

86
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.401
fight any more.

87
00:08:06.777 --> 00:08:10.531
Kugisaki died. and Nanami too.

88
00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:15.870
Sukuna killed so many people.

89
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.288
So...

90
00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:23.377
I must help more people.

91
00:08:24.378 --> 00:08:26.464
But I just can't do it.

92
00:08:26.547 --> 00:08:28.799
I'm nothing but a murderer.

93
00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:33.971
What I thought to be my conviction...

94
00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:38.309
turned out to be only my excuses!

95
00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:46.317
I...

96
00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:50.363
I can't forgive myself.

97
00:08:51.405 --> 00:08:54.742
Speak up. I can't hear you!

98
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.344
<i>Interesting.</i>

99
00:09:13.427 --> 00:09:16.097
<i>I know his tricks. but he still got me.</i>

100
00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:18.474
Brother.

101
00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:22.353
You should never belittle yourself.

102
00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:24.939
We are Jujutsu Sorcerers.

103
00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:26.607
Whether it's me.

104
00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:28.109
you.

105
00:09:28.192 --> 00:09:29.485
Kugisaki.

106
00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:31.070
Mr. Nanami.

107
00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:36.200
or any other companions.
we are all Jujutsu Sorcerers.

108
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:39.328
As long as we're alive.

109
00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.372
our friends who died

110
00:09:41.455 --> 00:09:44.625
haven't really been defeated.

111
00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:48.045
This isn't about sin or punishment.

112
00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:51.632
From the moment we chose
to become Jujutsu Sorcerers.

113
00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:57.138
<i>our lives are no longer subject to karma.</i>

114
00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:01.767
<i>Sometimes. it's disrespectful to the dead</i>

115
00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:04.770
<i>to try to find meaning
or reason for each life lost.</i>

116
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:06.897
But still...

117
00:10:09.066 --> 00:10:11.652
What have those people entrusted to you?

118
00:10:15.489 --> 00:10:18.534
There's no need to find
the answer immediately.

119
00:10:19.118 --> 00:10:23.414
But you must not stop
before you find the answer.

120
00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:27.418
For the Jujutsu Sorcerers who are alive.

121
00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:29.295
this is the most basic punishment.

122
00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:35.801
<i>I don't need to tell him that yet.</i>

123
00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:46.103
I used my Cursed Technique on you.

124
00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:48.356
Listen carefully. Itadori.

125
00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:52.735
{\an8}Your current injuries
won't continue to worsen.

126
00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.905
{\an8}They haven't healed.
but the bleeding has stopped.

127
00:10:55.988 --> 00:10:57.531
The pain will also gradually lessen.

128
00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:59.950
But this applies only
to your current injuries.

129
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:03.537
If you get attacked again.
new wounds will still appear

130
00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:06.791
and they're beyond
the reach of my technique.

131
00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:10.002
<i>Mr. Todo's brother doesn't
look like him at all.</i>

132
00:11:11.045 --> 00:11:13.589
I treated that girl over there
in the same way.

133
00:11:15.424 --> 00:11:17.510
Although her breathing
and pulse have stopped.

134
00:11:17.593 --> 00:11:19.303
it hasn't been very long.

135
00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:21.305
She still has a chance to be saved.

136
00:11:22.431 --> 00:11:24.683
I'll take her away now.

137
00:11:25.726 --> 00:11:27.436
It's only a possibility.

138
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.438
Don't get your hopes too high.

139
00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:38.864
Have you finished?

140
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.001
What's wrong?
Aren't you going to touch me?

141
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.336
<i>He's really good.</i>

142
00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:39.091
<i>Keeping a distance from Itadori
while dealing with my attack.</i>

143
00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:41.510
It's not just that.

144
00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:46.515
<i>Just a dodge?</i>

145
00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.267
<i>Come on. Let's switch positions.</i>

146
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:51.520
<i>I'll see through your trick and hit you.</i>

147
00:12:52.229 --> 00:12:55.024
<i>I really want to use that move again.</i>

148
00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:58.277
<i>I can feel that I am just one step away</i>

149
00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:01.780
<i>from touching the essence of my soul.</i>

150
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.162
<i>Sorry. Nanami.</i>

151
00:13:09.246 --> 00:13:10.748
<i>I almost wanted to relieve myself.</i>

152
00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:15.419
<i>I even used sin as an excuse to escape.</i>

153
00:13:19.089 --> 00:13:20.674
I will leave the rest to you.

154
00:13:21.884 --> 00:13:23.469
Black Flash!

155
00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:34.605
<i>From now on.</i>

156
00:13:35.314 --> 00:13:38.776
<i>I will suffer in your place
as well. Nanami.</i>

157
00:13:45.699 --> 00:13:47.326
You're still alive?

158
00:13:56.877 --> 00:13:58.337
Welcome back.

159
00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.421
Right.

160
00:14:01.048 --> 00:14:04.969
SUBWAY INFO:
SHIBUYA STATION IS CURRENTLY CLOSED.

161
00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:10.849
<i>The battle will end soon.</i>

162
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.103
<i>It's meaningless to rush to Shibuya now.</i>

163
00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:15.688
<i>Go back...</i>

164
00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:17.356
<i>Miwa.</i>

165
00:14:31.745 --> 00:14:34.456
Why did you only ask for
Mr. Todo and Nitta?

166
00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:36.458
<i>Based on my judgment.</i>

167
00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:39.169
<i>Todo has a 99% chance of survival
if he goes to Shibuya.</i>

168
00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:42.923
<i>The same goes for Nitta.</i>

169
00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:44.884
<i>His technique will be useful.</i>

170
00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:46.093
What about me?

171
00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:54.476
Am I not useful?

172
00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:02.401
<i>It's not about that anymore.</i>

173
00:15:03.193 --> 00:15:04.737
<i>It's not just you.</i>

174
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:09.199
<i>Mai. Kamo. Nishimiya. even Utahime.</i>

175
00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:14.163
<i>I have arranged for them to go
to the south of Kyoto on the 31st.</i>

176
00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:17.166
Why didn't you say anything?

177
00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:19.960
Why didn't you talk to me about it?

178
00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:22.796
Aren't we friends?

179
00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:28.385
Is it because I'm too weak?

180
00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:31.305
<i>No. I'm the one who's weak.</i>

181
00:15:32.681 --> 00:15:35.476
<i>Because I'm weak. I used the wrong method.</i>

182
00:15:35.559 --> 00:15:39.647
<i>Because I'm weak. I couldn't
follow through with my mistake.</i>

183
00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.739
<i>There was someone I really liked.</i>

184
00:15:49.406 --> 00:15:51.408
<i>I thought no matter how the world changed.</i>

185
00:15:52.076 --> 00:15:54.578
<i>it'd be okay as long as
I could stay by her side and protect her.</i>

186
00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:02.503
<i>Even if the person
she hoped to protect her...</i>

187
00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:06.048
<i>might not be me.</i>

188
00:16:22.272 --> 00:16:23.107
<i>Time's up.</i>

189
00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.149
<i>Miwa.</i>

190
00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:25.734
No!

191
00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:27.987
<i>Goodbye. Thank you for...</i>

192
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.947
Don't say that!

193
00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:32.116
<i>Miwa.</i>

194
00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:33.242
Mechamaru!

195
00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:34.785
<i>Miwa.</i>

196
00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:37.871
You have to be happy.

197
00:16:40.374 --> 00:16:42.042
No matter how.

198
00:16:42.126 --> 00:16:44.003
as long as you are happy.

199
00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:46.422
my wish would be fulfilled.

200
00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:53.679
Mechamaru...

201
00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:09.403
Miss Utahime. the things Mechamaru did...

202
00:17:09.486 --> 00:17:12.740
Never mind.
The person involved is dead anyway.

203
00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.243
He really underestimated us.

204
00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:17.953
Yes.

205
00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:20.622
He also said Todo wouldn't die.

206
00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:23.542
and we're sure to die if we go
but that doesn't matter.

207
00:17:24.585 --> 00:17:28.338
Whoever makes my cute junior cry must die.

208
00:17:44.563 --> 00:17:46.732
<i>Exchange places with an inanimate object?</i>

209
00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:09.671
<i>Split?</i>

210
00:18:24.394 --> 00:18:26.939
<i>Soul Multiplicity. Body Repel!</i>

211
00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:49.711
<i>The spiritual residue
of this guy is very intact.</i>

212
00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:52.464
<i>But can I kill him with one touch now?</i>

213
00:18:53.257 --> 00:18:57.261
<i>Itadori's soul only has about 10% left.</i>

214
00:18:57.928 --> 00:19:01.557
<i>And my soul still has about 40% left.</i>

215
00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:04.601
<i>My duplicate was crushed.</i>

216
00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:08.564
<i>Itadori's attacks and Black Flash
also wore down a lot of my soul.</i>

217
00:19:09.064 --> 00:19:12.818
<i>It's all that woman's fault.</i>

218
00:19:12.901 --> 00:19:16.488
<i>A piece of trash like her
managed to hurt me in the end.</i>

219
00:19:17.197 --> 00:19:20.325
<i>Exchanging places is a hassle.
I'll kill him first.</i>

220
00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:50.123
Brother!

221
00:20:57.547 --> 00:21:00.133
<i>If that is enough to satisfy you...</i>

222
00:21:00.217 --> 00:21:03.345
<i>we will no longer be best friends.</i>

223
00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:08.392
<i>This Cursed Spirit
successfully used Black Flash.</i>

224
00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:12.229
<i>Now the person who's left behind is me.</i>

225
00:21:12.312 --> 00:21:15.274
<i>You have become stronger. Brother.</i>

226
00:21:15.357 --> 00:21:19.111
<i>Are you willing to maintain
the status quo. Aoi Todo?</i>

227
00:21:19.194 --> 00:21:24.241
<i>Are you going to leave
Itadori alone again. Aoi Todo?</i>

228
00:21:44.219 --> 00:21:46.722
<i>Takada!</i>

229
00:21:47.472 --> 00:21:48.890
<i>Black Flash!</i>

230
00:21:59.484 --> 00:22:01.778
<i>No matter how powerful your attack is.</i>

231
00:22:01.862 --> 00:22:03.655
<i>no matter how many times
you use Black Flash.</i>

232
00:22:03.739 --> 00:22:07.993
<i>it's meaningless
if you can't hurt my soul.</i>

233
00:22:17.127 --> 00:22:18.045
<i>However.</i>

234
00:22:18.712 --> 00:22:21.506
<i>from this point. all three of them...</i>

235
00:22:23.091 --> 00:22:23.925
Mwah.

236
00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:28.597
<i>...have reached 120% of their potential.</i>

237
00:22:35.228 --> 00:22:37.147
Soul Multiplicity...

238
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.482
Body Repel!

239
00:22:41.359 --> 00:22:44.529
<i>A full-range attack that makes
exchanging places meaningless.</i>

240
00:22:44.613 --> 00:22:46.823
<i>He is getting serious.</i>

241
00:23:16.269 --> 00:23:19.064
Try harder. Itadori!

242
00:23:19.147 --> 00:23:24.236
This is the last time we curse each other!

243
00:23:26.822 --> 00:23:29.533
<i>Heroes always appear late.</i>

244
00:23:29.616 --> 00:23:32.744
<i>But don't forget. people who fight
till the moment the hero appears</i>

245
00:23:32.828 --> 00:23:35.455
<i>are also heroes.</i>

246
00:23:35.539 --> 00:23:37.666
<i>Next episode: Transformation.</i>

247
00:23:37.749 --> 00:23:40.085
<i>Don't forget to get
a certificate of delay.</i>
