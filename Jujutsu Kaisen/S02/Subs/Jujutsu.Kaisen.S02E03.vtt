00:25.220 --> 00:26.710
It's from Kuroi.

00:29.390 --> 00:31.080
Wh-What do we do?!

00:31.630 --> 00:33.040
Kuroi has...

00:33.480 --> 00:35.040
Kuroi has been...

00:37.220 --> 00:39.390
There's always a chance 
the worst could happen.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.520
You're much faster than me,

00:41.520 --> 00:43.520
so go on ahead! Hurry to Riko's side!

00:46.690 --> 00:49.320
I'm sorry. This was my mistake.

00:49.320 --> 00:50.580
Really?

00:50.580 --> 00:52.980
I don't think this even counts as a mistake.

00:52.980 --> 00:56.570
I underestimated how much our 
enemies would value Kuroi-san.

00:57.010 --> 00:58.360
Their next move

00:58.360 --> 01:01.080
will probably be offering to 
arrange an exchange for her.

01:01.080 --> 01:03.800
Something like trading Amanai for Kuroi-san,

01:03.800 --> 01:06.930
or saying they'll kill Kuroi-san 
if we don't kill Amanai.

01:07.890 --> 01:11.510
But we have the leverage in any 
negotiations since we have Amanai.

01:12.080 --> 01:14.420
As long as they set up 
the location for the deal,

01:14.420 --> 01:16.580
we can make it work out.

01:17.220 --> 01:19.940
I'm taking Amanai back to Jujutsu High now.

01:19.940 --> 01:23.030
We can have Shoko or someone 
stand in as her body double.

01:22.010 --> 01:23.030
H-Hold on!

01:24.050 --> 01:26.140
I'm going to this deal, too!

01:26.140 --> 01:27.970
I still can't trust you two yet!

01:27.970 --> 01:30.690
Huh?! You're still saying 
that after all this, youâ€”

01:30.690 --> 01:32.350
Even if you do manage to save her...

01:33.540 --> 01:37.590
What if Kuroi isn't back before 
I assimilate with Tengen-sama?

01:38.850 --> 01:39.570
I haven't...

01:43.220 --> 01:45.010
I haven't even said goodbye to her!

01:56.310 --> 01:59.040
The kidnapper will reach 
out to us eventually.

01:59.800 --> 02:02.760
If they seem like they're 
smarter than we expect,

02:02.760 --> 02:07.350
and bringing you with us is likely to 
hurt Kuroi-san's chance of survival...

02:11.100 --> 02:13.290
then we will leave you behind.

02:21.280 --> 02:24.030
All right. That works.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.840
In exchange,

02:26.840 --> 02:30.490
if you get scared partway through and 
want to go home, we'll just ignore you.

02:31.460 --> 02:32.880
Bear that in mind.

02:38.360 --> 02:41.250

and by a non-sorcerer at that.

04:34.290 --> 04:36.450
I'm ashamed of myself.

04:36.450 --> 04:39.080
You couldn't help it if they 
caught you off-guard.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.960
Part of the blame lies with me, too.

04:41.490 --> 04:44.710
Was I really caught off-guard?

04:46.200 --> 04:50.310
I thought I was on high alert 
after the incident with Q.

04:51.150 --> 04:52.610
Kuroi!

04:54.330 --> 04:57.810
I still don't have much 
recollection of being attacked.

04:58.100 --> 05:00.880
And you all came here by plane?

05:00.880 --> 05:02.440
Were you okay?

05:02.440 --> 05:03.940
You weren't attacked?

05:04.270 --> 05:06.030
Satoru has good eyes.

05:07.630 --> 05:10.450
Before we took off, he checked over 
all the passengers and staff,

05:11.670 --> 05:14.100
as well as the inside 
and outside of the plane.

05:14.860 --> 05:18.620
And while we were in the air, I had 
my cursed spirit keep watch outside.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.150
It was safer than using a land route.

05:24.390 --> 05:26.370
I'm more curious as to why

05:26.370 --> 05:29.640
they designated Okinawa for the exchange.

05:29.970 --> 05:32.140
Probably to buy time, right?

05:42.110 --> 05:45.580

He's probably showing consideration 
for Riko-chan, in his own way.

I didn't make it in time with my

11:34.100 --> 11:36.120
I then strengthened myself

12:40.800 --> 12:43.160
When facing people 
without openings like you,

12:43.160 --> 12:46.660
you have to first create ups and 
downs leading to several false goals.

12:47.030 --> 12:51.270
I laughed when those Star Religious 
Group men went to Okinawa.

12:51.570 --> 12:55.200
It sucked that none of the

but if I hadn't set that

<i>He has a Heavenly Pact

<i>I can't imagine anyone who knows

13:59.820 --> 14:02.540
Sorry, but I won't let it get close!

14:17.600 --> 14:20.240
<i>Since he has no cursed energy, 
I can't read his presence.</i>

14:20.240 --> 14:23.380
<i>And I can't just rely on instinct.</i>

14:23.380 --> 14:26.170
<i>There's that cursed spirit 
wrapped around him.</i>

14:26.170 --> 14:28.760
<i>I just need to follow its presence.</i>

<i>Even so, he's too damn fast!</i>

15:02.080 --> 15:03.750
<i>He can't launch surprise attacks.</i>

15:03.750 --> 15:05.390
<i>Did he hide in the woods?</i>

<i>Are those...</i>

15:10.000 --> 15:11.380
<i>Fly Heads?!</i>

15:15.780 --> 15:18.520
<i>Was he keeping them inside

15:18.800 --> 15:21.280
So you're using Fly Heads like chaff.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.200
<i>Now I can't tell where he is.</i>

15:25.010 --> 15:27.040
<i>He's created a blind spot.</i>

15:27.040 --> 15:28.480
<i>I should use Blue again...</i>

<i>No, wait! He's after...</i>

15:32.030 --> 15:33.370
<i>Amanai!</i>

<i>His intuition is keen enough 
to sense me empty-handed.</i>

15:42.960 --> 15:45.530
<i>There's no way your Six Eyes would overlook</i>

15:45.910 --> 15:48.760
<i>the unusual cursed energy

15:50.120 --> 15:51.490

18:10.900 --> 18:12.180
So this is...

18:12.180 --> 18:13.190
Yeah.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.570
We're in Tengen-sama's territory now.

18:17.160 --> 18:19.320
This is the foundation of 
the nation's key barriers,

18:20.130 --> 18:22.450
The Main Hall of the Tombs of the Star.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.560
Once you descend the stairs,

18:25.560 --> 18:29.580
pass through the gate and continue 
to the base of the big tree.

18:29.970 --> 18:33.230
Then you'll be inside the special 
barrier that's separate from

18:33.230 --> 18:35.090
the barrier surrounding Jujutsu High.

18:35.570 --> 18:38.270
Only those invited are able to enter it.

18:38.960 --> 18:42.300
Tengen-sama will protect 
you until the assimilation.

18:44.930 --> 18:46.340
That...

18:46.340 --> 18:49.480
or we can turn back around 
and go home with Kuroi-san.

18:53.730 --> 18:54.590
Huh?

18:54.590 --> 18:58.200
When our teacher told us about this mission,

18:58.200 --> 19:01.540
he called the assimilation "erasing."

19:02.240 --> 19:06.450
He was trying to tell us to be aware 
of how heavy a sin that was.

19:06.450 --> 19:08.780
Our teacher may be a muscle-brain,

19:08.780 --> 19:10.840
but he often does roundabout things.

19:14.790 --> 19:19.120
Satoru and I already talked it 
over before we met you.

19:20.880 --> 19:24.600
What if the Star Plasma Vessel 
brat refuses to assimilate?

19:24.600 --> 19:28.100
Then... the assimilation's off!

19:29.650 --> 19:30.840
Are you sure about that?

19:30.840 --> 19:31.600
Huh?

19:32.000 --> 19:35.610
It might mean fighting 
Tengen-sama, you know.

19:37.300 --> 19:39.120
You scared?

19:39.600 --> 19:42.280
It's fine. It'll all work out somehow.

19:43.190 --> 19:45.880
We are the strongest.

19:46.220 --> 19:48.850
No matter what decision you make,

19:48.850 --> 19:51.460
we will guarantee your future.

19:55.780 --> 19:56.800
I have...

19:57.830 --> 19:59.970
<i>always been special, 
since the day I was born.</i>

20:00.580 --> 20:03.250
<i>Everyone kept telling me 
that I was different.</i>

20:04.640 --> 20:07.430
<i>Being special was normal to me,</i>

20:07.850 --> 20:09.910
<i>and I've lived my life trying 
to avoid danger</i>

20:09.910 --> 20:12.020
<i>as much as possible 
for the sake of this day.</i>

20:13.540 --> 20:17.410
<i>I don't really remember the 
day my mother and father died.</i>

20:17.720 --> 20:20.150
<i>I no longer feel sad or lonely about that.</i>

20:21.870 --> 20:23.400
<i>I figured everything would be fine,</i>

20:23.400 --> 20:26.870
<i>even if I was taken away 
from everyone and assimilated.</i>

20:30.300 --> 20:32.240
<i>That no matter how hard it was,</i>

20:32.630 --> 20:36.420
<i>it would stop feeling sad and lonely one day.</i>

20:38.180 --> 20:39.160
<i>But...</i>

20:40.060 --> 20:41.120
<i>But...</i>

20:41.620 --> 20:42.900
<i>Honestly...</i>

20:43.920 --> 20:46.900
I want to be with everyone longer!

20:46.900 --> 20:50.600
I want to go to all kinds 
of places with everyone!

20:51.190 --> 20:55.790
I want to see all kinds 
of things and do more!

20:56.560 --> 20:59.280
Let's go home, Riko-chan.

21:06.450 --> 21:07.310
Yeah!

21:23.340 --> 21:24.480
Riko-chan?

21:26.320 --> 21:27.950
Okay, job's done.

21:30.210 --> 21:32.030
You're free to go now.

21:36.940 --> 21:39.200
Why are you here?

21:41.120 --> 21:42.550
Why?

21:43.070 --> 21:45.600
Oh, that's what you mean.

21:47.960 --> 21:51.120
Because I killed Satoru Gojo.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.030
Is that so?

22:06.930 --> 22:08.110
Die!

23:41.270 --> 23:44.850
They say it's never too late 
to start something,

23:44.850 --> 23:48.930
but the bigger problem is always 
when to quit, not when to start.

23:49.370 --> 23:52.410
"Please look forward to the next 
episode: Hidden Inventory 4!"

23:49.650 --> 23:56.260
<b>Next Episode
Hidden Inventory 4</b>

23:52.410 --> 23:54.260
I can't even say that.
