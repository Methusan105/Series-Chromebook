00:28.920 --> 00:30.250
Please!

00:30.250 --> 00:31.840
Please listen to me!

00:31.840 --> 00:33.550
I was wrong!

00:33.550 --> 00:34.550
I'm sorry!

00:34.550 --> 00:35.750
I'm really sorry!

00:36.140 --> 00:37.550
Let's kiss!

00:37.550 --> 00:37.930
Huh?!

00:37.930 --> 00:40.970
Let's kiss!

00:41.520 --> 00:43.480
I'll pull out of this job!

00:43.480 --> 00:45.140
I'll quit being a curse user, too!

00:45.140 --> 00:46.450
Let's kiss!

00:46.810 --> 00:48.900
C'mon, kiss!

00:48.900 --> 00:51.110
Of course I'll quit Q, too!

00:51.110 --> 00:54.110
I know! I'll go back to the 
countryside and farm rice!

00:56.070 --> 00:57.530
I know you can hear me!

00:58.320 --> 01:01.080
Like a curse user could cut it as a farmer.

01:01.080 --> 01:02.750
You <i>can</i> hear me!

01:02.750 --> 01:05.330
Damn student acting all condescending!

01:05.080 --> 01:08.830
Lick, lick.

01:05.330 --> 01:07.670
But Bayer-san is here, too!

01:07.670 --> 01:10.000
He's Q's strongest combatant!

01:10.840 --> 01:12.800
He'll take care of you and these things!

01:12.800 --> 01:13.800
Hey.

01:14.420 --> 01:16.300
Is this your "Bayer"?

01:16.510 --> 01:17.300
Huh?

01:20.970 --> 01:22.970
That's him.

01:24.430 --> 01:27.810
<b>"Q"</b>

01:24.430 --> 01:27.810
Departure of Top Combatant, Bayer,
Leads to Organization's Collapse

01:33.150 --> 01:35.780
<i>And all the boats are off at once.</i>

01:35.780 --> 01:39.030
<i>From the inside, we have Numbers 
1, 2, 4, 5, 3, and 6 starting the race.</i>

01:39.030 --> 01:41.780
<i>They're off with a beautiful straight shot.</i>

01:42.740 --> 01:46.290
And just what are you doing after 
suddenly disappearing on me?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.090
Getting more money.

01:51.750 --> 01:54.670
I've never seen you win once.

01:55.010 --> 01:56.670
What about your job?

01:57.380 --> 01:59.090
Oh, give it a rest.

01:59.090 --> 02:01.720
You're talking like I'm unemployed.

02:03.510 --> 02:05.010
Because you are.

02:05.400 --> 02:10.400
As a mediator, it's my duty to report 
how the job's going to the client.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.770
I'm up against the Gojo clan's kid.

02:12.770 --> 02:16.190
I wouldn't be able to do anything 
if I just popped up in front of him.

02:16.530 --> 02:19.660
I have to wear him down
using some idiots first.

02:20.010 --> 02:21.740
You go do your own damn job.

02:21.740 --> 02:23.530
Already did, dumbass.

02:23.530 --> 02:27.550
What were you thinking, 
letting go of the entire deposit?

02:28.250 --> 02:30.330
I told you, wearing him down.

02:30.330 --> 02:33.040
Don't you worry. All that 
money will come back to me.

02:33.040 --> 02:35.000
Just like with this race.

02:36.840 --> 02:39.090
<i>Number 6, Hateno, crosses the line first!</i>

02:39.090 --> 02:41.300
<i>Number 1, Doguchi, finishes next!</i>

02:41.300 --> 02:43.470
<i>Following them in third is Number 2, Matsuda.</i>

02:43.470 --> 02:45.260
<i>In fourth is Number 4, Nakaoka.</i>

02:44.010 --> 02:45.100
Tsk.

02:45.260 --> 02:47.100
<i>In fifth is Number 3, Tanaka.</i>

02:45.260 --> 02:48.520
You're not cut out for making easy money.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.310
<i>In sixth is Number 5, 
Okazaki, finishing last!</i>

02:49.310 --> 02:53.730
<i>Number 6, Hateno, has given us an amazing 
comeback to watch in his first race!</i>

02:49.480 --> 02:52.520
I'm counting on you, Sorcerer Killer.

02:53.730 --> 02:55.230
<i>That was our third race of the day.</i>

02:53.810 --> 02:55.230
Oh, right.

02:55.900 --> 02:57.360
How's Megumi doing?

03:09.210 --> 03:10.370
Who's that?

03:10.960 --> 03:13.960

04:44.880 --> 04:46.930
Should we get her to a doctor?

04:47.240 --> 04:51.390
I wish I could use reverse 
cursed energy like Shoko.

04:51.390 --> 04:52.890
Yeah, that's impossible.

04:52.890 --> 04:55.640
I can't understand a word she says about it.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.190
You go "fwoo," then "hyoi."

04:58.190 --> 05:01.230
Fwoo, hyoi. Get it?

05:01.230 --> 05:02.940
You've got no sense for this.

05:07.740 --> 05:08.950
You're awake.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.040
You scum!

05:19.040 --> 05:22.300
If you want to kill me, 
you'll be the one to die first!

05:24.760 --> 05:26.720
Riko-chan, calm down.

05:26.720 --> 05:30.240
We're not with the group that attacked you.

05:30.240 --> 05:31.470
Liar!

05:31.470 --> 05:32.890
You have the face of a liar!

05:32.890 --> 05:34.600
Your bangs are weird, too!

05:41.190 --> 05:45.940
<b>Grind</b>

05:42.360 --> 05:45.740
This is disrespectful!

05:42.780 --> 05:44.570
<b>This is disrespectful!</b>

P-Please stop it!

05:45.740 --> 05:46.950
Kuroi!

05:49.110 --> 05:52.280
Young lady, these men are our allies.

05:53.160 --> 05:56.370
Kuroi, what are you riding on?

05:56.750 --> 05:59.500
This is thanks to Bangs Guy's technique.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.750
Could you please not call me that?

06:02.800 --> 06:04.550
It's Curse Manipulation.

06:04.550 --> 06:08.010
As the name suggests, I can absorb 
and manipulate cursed spirits.

06:08.340 --> 06:11.260
This brat is more aggressive 
than I expected.

06:11.260 --> 06:13.760
I was trying to figure out 
how to be considerate,

06:13.760 --> 06:16.350
thinking she'd be more sentimental 
about the assimilation thing.

06:16.730 --> 06:17.680
Hmph!

06:17.680 --> 06:20.480
A commoner's way of thinking!

06:20.480 --> 06:21.310
Huh?!

06:21.310 --> 06:22.100
Listen up!

06:24.440 --> 06:28.820
Tengen-sama is me, and I am Tengen-sama!

06:28.820 --> 06:32.620
Some might mistake 
assimilation for death, as you do,

06:32.620 --> 06:35.280
but there's a big difference!

06:35.540 --> 06:38.580
I might become Tengen-sama 
through the assimilation,

06:38.580 --> 06:41.160
but Tengen-sama will also become me!

06:41.440 --> 06:43.540
My will! My heart!

06:43.540 --> 06:45.900
My soul will continue to live 
on after the assimilation!

06:45.900 --> 06:47.050
You changed your home screen?

06:47.050 --> 06:48.340
To Waka Inoue.

06:48.340 --> 06:49.510
Listen to me!

06:50.010 --> 06:53.140
I bet you don't have many 
friends if you talk like that.

06:53.140 --> 06:55.140
We won't have to feel bad sending you off.

06:55.140 --> 06:57.390
I talk normally at school!

07:00.060 --> 07:00.940
School!

07:00.940 --> 07:02.400
Kuroi, what time is it?!

07:02.400 --> 07:05.520
It's not yet noon. But I think going to schoolâ€”

07:05.520 --> 07:06.360
Be quiet!

07:06.360 --> 07:08.150
I said I'm going, and I'm going!

07:10.360 --> 07:11.610
Huh?!

07:12.430 --> 07:15.500
Surely it'd be safer to head 
back to Jujutsu High at once!

07:15.830 --> 07:20.580
<i>As much as I want to do that, 
this is an order from Tengen-sama.</i>

07:20.910 --> 07:24.420
<i>He said to fulfill all of 
Riko Amanai's demands.</i>

07:25.840 --> 07:26.960
Tsk.

07:30.470 --> 07:32.630
Lax upbringing at its finest.

07:33.160 --> 07:34.850
Don't be like that, Satoru.

07:34.850 --> 07:36.180
Despite what she may say,

07:36.180 --> 07:38.470
after the assimilation, she'll spend 
her whole life as Tengen-sama

07:38.470 --> 07:40.980
in the deepest floor of Jujutsu High, 
as the foundation of all barriers.

07:41.520 --> 07:46.570
She won't be able to see her friends, 
family, or anyone precious to her ever again.

07:47.690 --> 07:49.070
Riko!

07:50.400 --> 07:51.920
Our next class is in a different room.

07:51.920 --> 07:52.480
Okay!

07:52.860 --> 07:54.320
Let her do what she wants.

07:55.030 --> 07:57.790
That's part of our mission.

08:00.670 --> 08:03.290
Riko-sama has no family.

08:03.290 --> 08:05.270
They were in an accident when she was little.

08:05.270 --> 08:08.090
I've taken care of her ever since then.

08:08.750 --> 08:12.140
So I want her to at least have 
what time she can with her friends.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.800
So you're her family, then.

08:18.390 --> 08:19.300
Yes.

08:22.600 --> 08:23.810
Suguru.

08:23.810 --> 08:25.730
How're the cursed spirits you 
sent to watch over her?

08:26.900 --> 08:30.780
I just wish I could share my senses 
with them like Mei-san does.

08:30.780 --> 08:33.650
Even so, they'll let us know as 
soon as anything unusual happens.

08:34.740 --> 08:35.910
Satoru.

08:35.910 --> 08:37.870
Hurry to Riko-chan's side.

08:37.870 --> 08:38.780
Huh?

08:40.400 --> 08:42.320
Two have been exorcised.

08:42.820 --> 08:45.120
<i>Who will be the ace of the next generation?</i>

08:45.120 --> 08:47.790
<i>This will be an important match 
to help us find out.</i>

08:48.380 --> 08:51.340
<i>Number 6's final position 
is finally starting to solidify.</i>

08:51.340 --> 08:54.880
<i>Now, the fifth race, the one all eyes 
are focused on, is about to begin.</i>

Where's Amanai?!

09:18.990 --> 09:21.030
She has music this period,

09:21.030 --> 09:23.120
so either the music room or the chapel.

09:23.120 --> 09:24.750
Chapel?!

09:24.750 --> 09:27.170
It changes depending on what 
the music teacher wants.

09:27.170 --> 09:29.040
Also, this is a missionary school.

09:29.380 --> 09:30.960
Satoru, you take the chapel.

09:30.960 --> 09:32.590
Kuroi-san, take the music room.

09:32.590 --> 09:34.460
I'll take the two unknowns.

09:34.460 --> 09:36.000
Roger that.

09:36.470 --> 09:37.930
I told you not to follow me!

09:37.930 --> 09:40.470
What if my friends see you?!

09:40.470 --> 09:42.100
I'm sorry.

09:42.100 --> 09:44.930
I even told her to text us 
when she was on the move.

09:44.930 --> 09:49.020
This is why I told that brat to stay within 
eyeshot so we could protect her!

09:52.020 --> 09:53.150
<i>And they're off.</i>

09:53.150 --> 09:55.610
<i>Numbers 1 and 2 make a good start, 
favoring the inside.</i>

09:55.610 --> 09:57.700
<i>Number 3 trails a bit behind.</i>

09:56.190 --> 09:57.780
What?

09:57.700 --> 10:01.070
<i>Taking the lead at the first mark of 
the first lap is Number 2, Yamazaki.</i>

09:58.070 --> 10:00.240
They didn't go back to Jujutsu High?

10:00.240 --> 10:01.780
Lucky me.

10:01.070 --> 10:02.510
<i>Behind him is Number 1, Masaki.</i>

10:02.510 --> 10:04.700
<i>They're followed by Number 3, Kawano.</i>

10:02.760 --> 10:06.830
Now the ones drawn to the bounty will
 be reasonable fools instead of just fools.

10:04.700 --> 10:09.500
<i>Then comes Number 4, Nomiya, Number 5, 
Mifune, and in last is Number 6, Funegi.</i>

10:06.830 --> 10:08.170
<i>Are you sure?</i>

10:08.170 --> 10:09.500
About what?

10:09.830 --> 10:14.360
<i>The bounty is the thirty-million deposit 
that the Star Religious Group paid you.</i>

10:14.760 --> 10:17.880
<i>If they kill the Star Plasma Vessel, 
the deposit is gone,</i>

10:17.880 --> 10:20.640
<i>and worst-case, you might not 
get the full reward, either.</i>

10:20.640 --> 10:23.350
<i>They might start saying 
they could have posted</i>

10:23.350 --> 10:25.850
<i>a bounty from the start 
instead of hiring you.</i>

10:25.850 --> 10:28.830
Satoru Gojo is with the girl.

10:28.830 --> 10:31.190
He's the first in several 
centuries to possess both

10:31.190 --> 10:33.270
the Six Eyes and the Limitless technique.

10:33.270 --> 10:37.440
No one can kill the Star Plasma 
Vessel as long as he's nearby.

10:37.440 --> 10:38.960
<i>Not even you?</i>

10:47.750 --> 10:49.890
<i>Number 3, Kawano, 
is making a rushing comeback!</i>

10:49.890 --> 10:51.750
<i>He's pulled into first place!</i>

10:51.750 --> 10:54.360
Who knows?

10:54.590 --> 10:57.130
<i>He's managed to take the lead twice now.</i>

10:55.920 --> 11:00.550
For now, we'll leave the bounty
 up for another 47 hours,

10:57.130 --> 11:00.550
<i>This race has been 
filled with ups and downs.</i>

11:00.550 --> 11:02.640
<i>Can Number 3, Kawano, 
defend his position at the top?</i>

11:00.880 --> 11:05.310
and let the fools wear down Gojo 
and the sorcerers with him.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.810
<i>The race is now entering its third lap.</i>

11:13.810 --> 11:14.900
Hey!

11:15.270 --> 11:16.570
Hold it right there!

11:22.910 --> 11:24.540
Nah, never mind.

11:27.790 --> 11:30.080
They won't be able to kill the 
Star Plasma Vessel, of course,

11:30.080 --> 11:31.580
so they're working for free.

11:32.080 --> 11:35.000
<i>It's a good thing you put 
that time limit on it.</i>

11:35.000 --> 11:37.800
<i>The curse users are 
quickly flocking to them.</i>

11:37.800 --> 11:39.760
That's not the only reason.

11:39.760 --> 11:40.380
<i>Eh?</i>

11:41.720 --> 11:43.050
Just talking to myself.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.260
<i>What?!</i>

11:45.050 --> 11:48.730
<i>Number 3, Kawano, just lost his balance, 
and Number 2, Yamazaki, is passing him!</i>

11:48.970 --> 11:50.930
<i>Number 3 has drifted far to the outside,</i>

11:49.020 --> 11:50.930
I'll head out soon enough.

11:50.930 --> 11:53.150
Looks like things are developing 
faster than I expected.

11:50.930 --> 11:53.310
<i>but he's righted his boat 
and is chasing after them!</i>

11:53.310 --> 11:55.310
<i>But there is now a considerable 
gap between them!</i>

11:53.650 --> 11:56.610
Make sure you get that 
thirty million back for me.

11:56.610 --> 11:58.820
<i>Number 2, Yamazaki, crosses the goal first!</i>

11:58.820 --> 12:00.530
<i>Number 5, Mifune, crosses next.</i>

11:59.190 --> 12:00.530
<i>Don't be ridiculous.</i>

12:00.530 --> 12:03.070
<i>This wasn't your average 
anonymous message board.</i>

12:00.530 --> 12:03.070
<i>Number 1, Masaki, crosses next, 
followed by Number 3, Kawano.</i>

12:03.070 --> 12:05.750
<i>Following them is Number 4, Nomiya, 
and last is Number 6, Funegi.</i>

12:03.070 --> 12:05.750
<i>There are posting fees, handling fees, andâ€”</i>

12:04.110 --> 12:05.750
Signal's dropping.

12:06.070 --> 12:07.200
Hey!

12:08.490 --> 12:10.160
That bastard.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.390
<i>Are the unknowns remnants of Q?</i>

12:22.750 --> 12:26.300
<i>This will be a little troublesome if they've 
been sent by the Star Religious Group.</i>

12:28.940 --> 12:31.430
That uniform...

12:36.520 --> 12:39.980
<i>As soon as he saw the Jujutsu High 
uniform, he anticipated a fight against</i>

12:39.980 --> 12:42.570
<i>multiple opponents and set 
shikigami in front of and behind him.</i>

12:42.570 --> 12:44.030
<i>He's experienced.</i>

12:45.660 --> 12:47.320
<i>No catalyst?!</i>

12:47.320 --> 12:49.740
<i>Their cursed energy is different 
from the sorcerer's, too.</i>

12:49.740 --> 12:51.080
<i>It couldn't be...</i>

12:51.080 --> 12:52.830
Curse Manipulation?!

12:53.190 --> 12:54.410
Correct.

12:54.410 --> 12:57.210
Living a long life has its perks, I see.

12:57.210 --> 13:00.380
Nah, it's not worth 
living too long, you know.

13:00.380 --> 13:03.670
It costs money just to stay alive.

13:03.670 --> 13:06.430
<i>His cursed technique is stronger than mine.</i>

13:06.430 --> 13:09.890
<i>However, he thinks like 
a typical shikigami user.</i>

13:09.890 --> 13:12.180
<i>Add his youth on top of that,</i>

13:12.180 --> 13:15.640
<i>and I can tell exactly what he's thinking.</i>

13:15.640 --> 13:17.400
<i>I knew it.</i>

13:17.400 --> 13:20.190
<i>Types like him never 
step forward themselves.</i>

13:20.440 --> 13:23.070
<i>Close combat is his weakness!</i>

13:23.070 --> 13:28.620
<i>Plus, he thinks a shikigami user 
like me would never get close to him.</i>

13:28.620 --> 13:32.200
<i>He's someone who hates close 
combat, and he isn't wary of it.</i>

13:32.200 --> 13:35.080
<i>No one is easier to kill.</i>

13:35.410 --> 13:38.540
Looks like you're thinking up lots of plans,

13:38.790 --> 13:40.130
but there's no point.

13:45.470 --> 13:45.970
<i>What?!</i>

13:45.970 --> 13:48.720
<i>Those first two were to prevent 
me from anticipating this?!</i>

13:53.520 --> 13:56.230
Now, that leaves one more.

14:00.230 --> 14:01.860
You're mine!

14:18.100 --> 14:21.590
Tasuke? Is that you, Tasuke?

14:22.320 --> 14:26.760
<i>My parents used all their time and money 
on my well-behaved little brother.</i>

14:26.760 --> 14:30.470
<i>They thought I was creepy 
because I could see the unseen.</i>

14:31.010 --> 14:36.100
<i>But Tasuke was my one and only friend, 
who interacted with me without such fear.</i>

14:38.270 --> 14:40.440
It's been a long time.

14:40.440 --> 14:43.320
Has it been over 50 years already?

14:43.320 --> 14:46.110
Since the day you diedâ€”

14:46.820 --> 14:48.400
<i>I see now!</i>

14:54.120 --> 14:56.040
<i>My life flashed before my eyes!</i>

14:56.450 --> 14:58.710
You lured me in!

14:58.710 --> 14:59.960
Well, yeah.

14:59.960 --> 15:03.230
You were itching to get in 
close that whole time, right?

15:03.230 --> 15:05.170
Those with a set means of victory

15:05.170 --> 15:08.210
will easily jump on the chance 
when you give them that opening.

15:09.970 --> 15:13.200
More importantly, are you with Q?

15:13.200 --> 15:14.680
Or the Star Religious Group?

15:38.120 --> 15:39.330
Amanai!

15:44.920 --> 15:47.500
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wha...

15:47.500 --> 15:49.090
What?!

15:49.090 --> 15:50.840
Riko, you have a boyfriend?!

15:50.840 --> 15:53.720
No! He's a cousin! Just a cousin!

15:53.720 --> 15:55.350
You're a smooth operator.

15:55.350 --> 15:57.180
I told you, he's not!

15:57.180 --> 15:59.520
A high schooler?! He's so tall!

15:59.520 --> 16:01.020
Hey, mister!

16:01.020 --> 16:02.520
Take off your sunglasses!

16:05.230 --> 16:07.040
Squee! He's so hot!

16:05.400 --> 16:07.040
<b>Squee!</b>

16:05.400 --> 16:07.040
<b>Squee!</b>

16:05.400 --> 16:07.040
<b>Squee!</b>

16:07.040 --> 16:08.440
Such long lashes!

16:07.570 --> 16:08.440
Hey.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.070
Why are your eyes blue?

16:10.070 --> 16:12.280
Could you pose for me?

16:12.820 --> 16:14.740
Hey! Quit getting carried away!

16:14.740 --> 16:16.950
All right, everyone! Quiet down!

16:16.950 --> 16:18.700
This is disgraceful!

16:18.700 --> 16:21.080
You know you're curious 
about him, too, Sensei!

16:21.080 --> 16:22.410
Yeah.

16:22.760 --> 16:24.210
This is inappropriate.

16:24.210 --> 16:26.500
Even if you are a relative, 
you can't just barge in.

16:26.500 --> 16:30.460
Oh, you'll have to forgive me.
It was an emergency.

16:32.920 --> 16:34.630
Also, here. My phone number.

16:34.630 --> 16:36.890
Hey! That's against the rules!

16:35.240 --> 16:35.990
<b>GRAAAH</b>

16:36.890 --> 16:39.690
Shut up! You don't get many chances 
to meet people as a teacher!

16:39.690 --> 16:41.890
The same is true for us, too!

16:41.890 --> 16:44.310
I can't believe you're into younger men! 
I've lost respect for you!

16:44.310 --> 16:46.860
What?! You dissin' Hikaru Genji?!

16:46.860 --> 16:48.790
What a lively school.

16:48.790 --> 16:52.080
You idiot! I told you not to show 
yourself before my friends!

16:52.740 --> 16:55.530
Curse users attacked. Figure out the rest.

16:56.950 --> 16:58.200
I'm floating?!

17:03.570 --> 17:05.260
We're heading to Jujutsu High now.

17:05.700 --> 17:08.030
You don't want you friends to 
get caught up in this, do you?

17:10.340 --> 17:12.340
Is that the thirty million?

17:12.340 --> 17:14.300
The one with her is another sorcerer?

17:14.300 --> 17:16.110
Her bodyguard, too, I bet.

17:16.440 --> 17:17.970
What a sweet deal.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.810
Thirty million for killing a kid 
who's not even a sorcerer.

17:20.810 --> 17:22.600
Maybe I'll have eel tonight?

17:22.600 --> 17:24.810
Food always tastes best 
after killing someone.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.270
Are you from the Star Religious Group?

17:27.650 --> 17:31.920
The people in Q wore even weirder outfits.

17:32.150 --> 17:33.650
Are you a rookie?

17:33.650 --> 17:35.780
If you're killing someone, do it without talking.

17:39.950 --> 17:41.120
Too slow.

17:54.530 --> 17:56.720
Don't you dare take anything from that girl.

17:57.450 --> 17:58.930
I'll kill you.

18:04.060 --> 18:05.230
What's this?

18:06.140 --> 18:07.810
Well, aren't you strong?

18:09.070 --> 18:10.230
Where's Riko-chan?

18:11.020 --> 18:13.610
She left the school with Gojo-sama.

18:13.610 --> 18:16.280
Then we should head that way, too.

18:16.280 --> 18:18.690
This has gotten a bit troublesome.

18:19.950 --> 18:22.740
So that really was the thirty million earlier.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.160
A shikigami?!

18:27.160 --> 18:29.620
No, it's not quite the same as a shikigami.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.040
Satoru.

18:31.420 --> 18:34.250
There's a bounty of thirty 
million on Amanai's head?

18:34.250 --> 18:38.220
<i>Yeah. It was posted on an 
underground site for curse users.</i>

18:38.220 --> 18:40.930
<i>Apparently, the time limit is
11 AM the day after tomorrow.</i>

18:41.430 --> 18:42.930
Now things make sense.

18:43.900 --> 18:47.680
Two, three, four... They all look the same.

18:47.680 --> 18:48.980
Are they shikigami?

18:49.330 --> 18:53.650
Jeez... And jujutsu sorcerers are 
short-handed all year round.

18:53.650 --> 18:56.670
If you want to change jobs, 
we'll welcome you, old man.

18:56.670 --> 18:59.990
Nah, public employment 
ain't easy work, either.

18:59.990 --> 19:02.620
Just hand over that brat and we'll be fine.

19:02.620 --> 19:04.170
There's more! Five of them now!

19:04.170 --> 19:07.450
What's so great about this brat?

19:16.460 --> 19:18.190
What did you just do?

19:18.450 --> 19:20.010
The shikigami isn't disappearing!

19:20.010 --> 19:21.720
Which is the real one?!

19:21.720 --> 19:22.990
They're not shikigami.

19:22.990 --> 19:24.300
They're clones.

19:24.300 --> 19:26.560
And each one is the real one.

19:31.230 --> 19:32.770
The hell is this?!

19:32.770 --> 19:33.690
Infinity.

19:33.690 --> 19:35.400
It's Achilles and the Tortoise.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.230
Huh?!

19:36.230 --> 19:38.740
It's important to study, you know.

19:40.820 --> 19:44.240
Yours is a cloning technique that allows 
a maximum of five, including the original.

19:44.240 --> 19:48.120
And you're always free to decide which 
of the clones is the main body, right?

19:48.120 --> 19:50.330
So if your main body is in danger,

19:50.330 --> 19:52.790
you make a safe clone the main body.

19:52.790 --> 19:54.750
That's a nice technique you have there.

19:54.750 --> 19:57.670
I don't understand why you're so weak.

19:58.630 --> 20:02.150
Are you unable to produce a clone 
for a while after it's destroyed?

20:02.150 --> 20:04.640
How do you know what my technique is?

20:04.640 --> 20:06.220
Unfortunately for you,

20:06.220 --> 20:07.970
I have good eyes.

20:08.620 --> 20:10.640
You see, my technique

20:10.640 --> 20:13.730
is like a convergent 
Series-Chromebook of infinite numbers.

20:13.730 --> 20:16.590
Anything that approaches me 
grows slower and slower,

20:16.590 --> 20:19.570
and ultimately, it fails to ever reach me.

20:20.100 --> 20:22.610
When I amplify my Limitless technique,

20:22.610 --> 20:25.370
I get what you might call 
a negative natural number.

20:25.370 --> 20:28.950
It basically creates a 
single imaginary apple.

20:29.580 --> 20:32.580
Doing so causes everything around to 
get sucked into that space, like you saw.

20:32.870 --> 20:34.580
Though it's surprisingly inconvenient.

20:34.830 --> 20:38.750
I can't create too large 
a reaction near myself,

20:38.750 --> 20:41.050
and if I start worrying 
about the vectors, too,

20:41.050 --> 20:44.010
controlling the cursed 
energy becomes a real pain.

20:44.470 --> 20:46.980
Basically, it's super exhausting.

20:50.220 --> 20:54.230
But that's all just the proper 
operation of the technique.

20:56.020 --> 20:57.900
Protect your head.

21:14.660 --> 21:16.960
This next one is the divergence of infinity.

21:19.250 --> 21:21.060
My reverse cursed technique,

21:22.670 --> 21:23.550
Red!

21:38.860 --> 21:40.360
I failed!

21:50.280 --> 21:53.240
I really thought I could do it that time.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.250
<i>Is this guy for real?</i>

21:59.170 --> 22:00.590
It's from Kuroi.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.420
Wh-What do we do?!

22:04.420 --> 22:05.510
Kuroi has...

22:06.180 --> 22:07.430
Kuroi has been...

23:40.480 --> 23:42.650
I've always thought the voices 
of young people should be heard,

23:42.650 --> 23:44.740
so I've voted in every election,

23:44.740 --> 23:48.150
but now I'm debating how long it's actually 
okay to consider myself a young person.

23:48.150 --> 23:49.530
Next time, "Hidden Inventory 3"!

23:48.150 --> 23:55.640
<b>Next Episode
Hidden Inventory 3</b>

23:49.530 --> 23:50.790
Be sure to watch!

23:50.790 --> 23:52.370
Exactly how old are you, Kuroi?

23:52.370 --> 23:53.120
It's a sekwet!

23:53.120 --> 23:54.290
Oh, how cute!
