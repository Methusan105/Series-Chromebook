Oh. you found Ralph Macchio.

5
00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:30.697
- Macchio?
- Yeah. he's the Karate Kid.

6
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.158
Hai-yah!

7
00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:34.826
He's so hot. right?

8
00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:37.037
I bet he's an amazing kisser. too.

9
00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:39.329
Hey. uh...

10
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.167
is Mike a good kisser?

11
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.251
I don't know.

12
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.795
He's my first boyfriend.

13
00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:47.797
Ex-boyfriend.

14
00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:52.093
Hey. don't worry about it. Okay?

15
00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:55.180
He'll come crawling back to you
in no time. begging for forgiveness.

16
00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:57.348
I guarantee you. him and Lucas are. like.

17
00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:59.934
totally wallowing in self-pity and misery
right now.

18
00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:02.228
They're like.
"Oh. I hope they take us back."

19
00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:06.357
God. what I wouldn't give
to see their stupid faces.

20
00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:10.402
What is it?

21
00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:20.955
Is this really gonna work?

22
00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:23.541
Holy shit. this is insane.

23
00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:25.085
- Max.
- Yeah. quiet. I'm sorry.

24
00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.219
<i>What's wrong with me?
What did I do wrong?</i>

25
00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:35.385
<i>Nothing.</i>

26
00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:40.350
What did I do wrong?
What could I have done wrong?

27
00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:42.113
Do I have to
go through this again?

28
00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:43.143
I see them.

29
00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:45.980
What are they doing?

30
00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:47.107
Eating.

31
00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:52.028
I just don't understand what I did
to deserve this.

32
00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.405
Nothing. Nothing.
That's my whole point.

33
00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:55.573
You are the victim here.

34
00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:57.909
I know. It's just.
why is she treating me this way?

35
00:01:57.992 --> 00:01:59.410
- I don't know.
- Mike...

36
00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:00.662
What did I do wrong?

37
00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:02.539
- What did I do wrong?!
- Mike. stop.

38
00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.749
Relax. Just relax.

39
00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:07.585
Okay? Stop asking rational questions.

40
00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:09.170
I know. I know. you're right.

41
00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:11.297
- Yeah.
- Because women act on emotion

42
00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:13.299
- and not logic.
- Precisely.

43
00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:15.051
It's a totally different species.

44
00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:17.679
They say we are "species."

45
00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:20.431
- What?
- "Emotion. not logic."

46
00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:21.516
What?

47
00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.892
Guys. it's ready.

48
00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.353
- Will. not right now.
- They broke up with you.

49
00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:27.373
- What else is there to talk about?
- Tons.

50
00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:30.692
Yeah. we're trying to solve
the great mystery of the female species.

51
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.074
Dude. you can smell the nacho cheese.

52
00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:41.077
- I got that beat.
- What?

53
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.288
- Oh. no.
- No. Lucas. no.

54
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:44.205
No!

55
00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:46.541
Lucas! Lucas!

56
00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:49.752
What happened?

57
00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:52.422
What...

58
00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.799
What? What happened?

59
00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:08.687
Hey!

60
00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:10.647
Hey!

61
00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.360
When I say three inches. three...

62
00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.613
Do you knock? Jeez!

63
00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:18.156
Yeah! Jeez!

64
00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.741
Oh. hey.

65
00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:21.701
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:23.703
- I thought that. uh...
- Mike's not here.

67
00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:25.663
Max wanted to have...

68
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.123
a sleepover.

69
00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:29.918
Is that... okay?

70
00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:31.294
Yeah.

71
00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:33.755
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

72
00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:34.923
Your parents know about it?

73
00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:36.466
Yup.

74
00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.468
Uh. yeah. it's cool.

75
00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:39.843
Yeah.

76
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:42.263
That's... That's really cool.

77
00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:47.727
Did you need something?

78
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.020
No. no.

79
00:03:49.103 --> 00:03:50.230
Uh. I'll leave.

80
00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:51.940
I'll just let you... I'll leave you...

81
00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:08.414
Holy shit.
I can't believe we're really doing this.

82
00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.252
- Ready?
- Ready.

83
00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.465
Mr. Wheeler.

84
00:04:17.715 --> 00:04:18.841
Ugh. Boring.

85
00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.260
Yeah. boring.

86
00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:21.636
Spin again.

87
00:04:23.012 --> 00:04:24.013
Against the rules?

88
00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:25.682
We make our own rules.

89
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.980
Billy.

90
00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.693
Okay. look. I should just warn you.

91
00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:39.028
if he's with a girl
or doing something gross.

92
00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:41.632
just get out of there right away
before you're scarred for life.

93
00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:43.376
- Max...
- No. I'm just saying. I'm serious.

94
00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:44.742
- He's really gross.
- Max!

95
00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.369
Okay. shutting up now.

96
00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:40.965
I found him.

97
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:42.591
What's he doing?

98
00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:44.177
I don't know.

99
00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:45.803
Don't be afraid.

100
00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.012
He's...

101
00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:48.598
on the floor...

102
00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:50.433
It'll be over soon.

103
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:52.810
...talking to someone.

104
00:05:57.398 --> 00:05:59.150
Just stay very still.

105
00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:14.998
Billy!

106
00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:21.756
What is it?

107
00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:22.965
What happened?

108
00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:43.087
Yes!

109
00:07:44.922 --> 00:07:47.550
- What are you doing?
- Yeah. Will. can you turn down the music?

110
00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:49.802
Please address me by my full name.

111
00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:52.096
- What?
- My full name!

112
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.349
Oh. my God. Okay. Will the Wise.

113
00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:57.518
can you please turn down the music?

114
00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:59.020
That is not music.

115
00:07:59.103 --> 00:08:01.606
That... is the sound of destiny!

116
00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:05.651
I have seen into the future.
and I've seen that today is a new day.

117
00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:06.735
a day...

118
00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:08.029
free of girls!

119
00:08:08.112 --> 00:08:10.239
What is happening right now?

120
00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.657
Will. come on.

121
00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:15.536
A tribe of villagers are under threat
from an evil force

122
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.622
from the swamps of Kuzatan.

123
00:08:17.705 --> 00:08:18.998
Will. it's so early.

124
00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:20.081
Is it?

125
00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:22.084
Is it early. Michael?

126
00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:24.712
Tell that to the villagers
crying for your help.

127
00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:26.631
the children so frightened.

128
00:08:26.714 --> 00:08:28.090
they cannot sleep.

129
00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.468
Are you truly going to let them perish?

130
00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:32.151
Or are you going to come to their rescue

131
00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:35.806
and become the heroes
you were always meant to be?

132
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.141
Uh...

133
00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:39.727
Can I at least take a shower first?

134
00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:47.777
Oh. God.

135
00:09:10.258 --> 00:09:12.218
Hopper? Are you there?

136
00:09:13.427 --> 00:09:15.721
Oh! Look who it is!

137
00:09:16.347 --> 00:09:17.265
We need to talk.

138
00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:18.683
Yeah. we do.

139
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:22.186
I haven't been stood up like that
since Alice Gilbert in the 9th grade.

140
00:09:23.437 --> 00:09:24.689
What are you doing?

141
00:09:25.439 --> 00:09:26.439
Joyce.

142
00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:28.818
- Hello?
- Just watch.

143
00:09:36.617 --> 00:09:37.910
Okay. you're freaking me out.

144
00:09:38.494 --> 00:09:40.538
- You slipped on this. remember?
- Yeah.

145
00:09:40.621 --> 00:09:42.623
Yeah. it fell in the night.
It lost its magnetism.

146
00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:45.126
- Oh. did it?
- And the same exact thing happened

147
00:09:45.209 --> 00:09:47.003
at my house the day before.

148
00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:49.171
- Wow.
- And I thought. "Okay. that's weird."

149
00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:52.425
Right? Why are all these magnets
suddenly losing their magnetism?

150
00:09:52.508 --> 00:09:54.385
- Uh-huh?
- So. I went and saw Scott.

151
00:09:54.468 --> 00:09:55.678
Scott.

152
00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:56.762
Who's Scott?

153
00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:59.348
- Scott Clarke.
- Your child's science teacher?

154
00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:01.559
He's pretty brilliant. actually.

155
00:10:01.642 --> 00:10:03.603
And I asked him. "How is this happening?"

156
00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:08.316
And he built this magnetic field
using an AC transformer

157
00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:10.234
and plugging it into a solenoid.

158
00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:12.695
And... And with that solenoid.
which basically...

159
00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:13.988
Slow down. slow down.

160
00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:16.324
I just want to get this exactly right.
okay?

161
00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:18.451
You stand me up...

162
00:10:18.534 --> 00:10:21.287
...no phone call. no apology.

163
00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:25.625
because you had to go
to Scott Clarke's house.

164
00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:26.959
Yeah.

165
00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:34.008
You've outdone yourself. Joyce.

166
00:10:34.091 --> 00:10:36.677
You really have.
No. you've outdone yourself.

167
00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:39.555
Oh. come on. Hop.
you're not even listening to me.

168
00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:42.808
Scott was able to demagnetize
some of the magnets. and he thinks...

169
00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:44.310
I don't care what Scott thinks!

170
00:10:44.393 --> 00:10:49.357
He thinks that a large-scale
magnetic field could be built

171
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.985
using some sort of machine
or... or experimental technology.

172
00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:54.403
He's brilliant. isn't he?

173
00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:57.323
He's really brilliant. Is he single too?

174
00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:00.910
What if it's them?

175
00:11:02.411 --> 00:11:05.831
To build a machine like this.
you need resources.

176
00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:08.334
You need scientists. you need funding.

177
00:11:08.417 --> 00:11:10.169
- tens of millions of dollars.
- Joyce.

178
00:11:10.252 --> 00:11:12.755
It can't just be a coincidence. Hopper.

179
00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:13.838
It has to be them.

180
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:14.881
Joyce. stop.

181
00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:16.217
It has to be the lab.

182
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.426
It is impossible.

183
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.553
- Well. then. prove it to me.
- Prove it?

184
00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:21.764
- Yeah. take me back there.
- To the lab.

185
00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:22.847
Yeah. I wanna go back.

186
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.892
Because some magnets
fell off your fridge.

187
00:11:24.975 --> 00:11:25.975
Yes.

188
00:11:27.311 --> 00:11:28.312
Okay. makes sense.

189
00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:29.980
Thank you.

190
00:11:30.606 --> 00:11:31.649
It makes sense.

191
00:11:31.732 --> 00:11:32.732
I'm sorry.

192
00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:36.237
I'm a little busy right now.
bu <i>t </i>maybe we canmeet up there.

193
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.072
like tonight. like seven o'clock?

194
00:11:38.155 --> 00:11:40.783
You know. of course.
unless something comes up

195
00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:43.619
- which. you know. it will.
- You know.

196
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.539
after everything that's happened.

197
00:11:46.622 --> 00:11:48.082
this is no joke.

198
00:11:48.165 --> 00:11:50.459
No. I don't think it's a joke.

199
00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:54.255
I think that when I asked you out.
I think you got scared.

200
00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:58.634
I think you got scared. and now.
you're inventing things.

201
00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:01.137
You're inventing things
to get worked up about

202
00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.098
so that you can push me away.

203
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:06.559
Because God forbid

204
00:12:06.642 --> 00:12:08.144
any of us

205
00:12:08.477 --> 00:12:09.562
move on!

206
00:12:10.187 --> 00:12:11.439
Because that...

207
00:12:12.606 --> 00:12:13.774
that would be...

208
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.194
I mean. that would be
too much. right. Joyce?

209
00:12:17.945 --> 00:12:18.945
You know?

210
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.866
That would be too much.
wouldn't it. Joyce?

211
00:12:24.326 --> 00:12:25.703
Wouldn't it. Joyce?

212
00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:34.002
Joyce?

213
00:12:36.088 --> 00:12:37.089
Joyce!

214
00:12:39.133 --> 00:12:41.677
- What the hell are you doing?
- I need to borrow these.

215
00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.554
No. you're not going back there.

216
00:12:43.971 --> 00:12:45.055
Joyce...

217
00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:48.184
Joyce. you're not going back there...

218
00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:50.478
Son of a bitch!

219
00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.067
It's gonna start pouring soon.

220
00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:59.945
We should be at the mall
or. like. watching a movie or something.

221
00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:01.822
You don't believe me?

222
00:13:02.656 --> 00:13:05.201
I believe you saw some
super weird stuff. totally.

223
00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:08.996
but you said Mike has
sensed you in there before. right?

224
00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:12.917
So maybe it was just like that.
Maybe Billy just...

225
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.627
sensed you somehow.

226
00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:18.881
- But the screams.
- Yeah. I know. but here's the thing.

227
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.051
When Billy is alone with a girl.

228
00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:24.595
they make. like. really crazy noises.

229
00:13:24.678 --> 00:13:27.723
- They scream?
- Yeah. but. like... happy screams.

230
00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:30.518
- Happy screams? What is happy screams?
- It's like...

231
00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:33.437
I'm just gonna lend you
my mom's <i>Cosmo.</i>

232
00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:36.774
His car's not here.

233
00:13:39.443 --> 00:13:40.861
You really want to do this?

234
00:13:47.117 --> 00:13:50.037
Why do I get the feeling we're gonna find
all kinds of wrong in here?

235
00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:01.382
Ugh!

236
00:14:01.465 --> 00:14:03.259
Gag me with a spoon.

237
00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:16.104
Max?

238
00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:21.777
Ice. It's just ice.

239
00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:25.364
Probably for his muscles or something.
He works out like a maniac.

240
00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:40.587
El. what is it?

241
00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:01.275
You sure about this?

242
00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:05.321
You really are your mother's son.
you know that?

243
00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:06.906
What's that supposed to mean?

244
00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:08.699
It means...

245
00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:10.367
you worry too much.

246
00:15:11.201 --> 00:15:13.078
- Huh.
- I got this. okay?

247
00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:15.914
Okay.

248
00:15:19.877 --> 00:15:23.172
So. what exactly are we looking at here?
Is this the Driscoll lady's stuff?

249
00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:25.674
No. No. see. that's the thing. I mean.

250
00:15:26.175 --> 00:15:28.677
listen. I thought she was crazy too. but...

251
00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:31.388
She told me Johnson killed Kennedy.

252
00:15:31.472 --> 00:15:34.433
But. it turns out. she's not alone.

253
00:15:35.017 --> 00:15:38.103
Blackburn's Supply. Hawkins Farming.
the Crawleys.

254
00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:41.273
they've all had some supplies go missing.
all in the past few days.

255
00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:43.150
And it's not just fertilizer.

256
00:15:43.233 --> 00:15:46.612
It's pesticides. cleaning supplies.
diesel fuel.

257
00:15:46.695 --> 00:15:49.531
And that's just from one day
of calling around. I mean...

258
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:50.949
there's gotta be more.

259
00:15:51.408 --> 00:15:54.286
Okay. wait. wait. wait.
Let me get this little...

260
00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:56.205
story of yours straight.

261
00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:59.833
So. little rodents have gone cuckoo
in their furry little minds

262
00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:02.002
and they're running around
the town of Hawkins.

263
00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:03.837
dining out on chemicals.

264
00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:06.340
I know how it sounds. but...

265
00:16:06.423 --> 00:16:07.508
But you've got proof!

266
00:16:09.426 --> 00:16:12.721
I mean. fellas. you gotta admit.
it's a hell of a headline. right?

267
00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:16.183
"Hawkins Rodents Prefer Poison:
Nutjob Tells All."

268
00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:19.269
Guys. that's enough.

269
00:16:19.353 --> 00:16:20.688
I think this is...

270
00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:22.648
big.

271
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:23.857
Bigger than one article.

272
00:16:23.941 --> 00:16:25.776
In fact.
I think this has got to be a book.

273
00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:28.570
<i>The Mysterious Case
of the Missing Fertilizer.</i>

274
00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:30.114
a Nancy Drew mystery.

275
00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:35.869
Next time a call comes in.

276
00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:37.496
do what you were hired for.

277
00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:38.789
and let us know. yeah?

278
00:16:38.872 --> 00:16:39.707
Ah...

279
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.583
We'll decide what's a story
and what's not.

280
00:16:42.876 --> 00:16:43.876
Okay.

281
00:16:44.628 --> 00:16:47.047
Bye-bye. Nancy Drew.

282
00:16:47.131 --> 00:16:49.174
Hey. it's okay. Nancy. Nancy!

283
00:16:51.969 --> 00:16:54.346
Excuse me.

284
00:16:55.723 --> 00:16:56.723
Ahoy!

285
00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:08.527
I'd like to try the peanut butter
chocolate swirl. please.

286
00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:10.571
No. No more samples today.

287
00:17:10.654 --> 00:17:11.905
Why not?

288
00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:13.949
Because you're abusing our company policy.

289
00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:15.868
Where's the sailor man?

290
00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:17.661
Sorry. he can't help you. He's busy.

291
00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:19.413
Busy with what?

292
00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:22.707
Spycraft.

293
00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:29.006
You see anything?

294
00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:31.967
Uh. I guess I don't totally know
what I'm looking for.

295
00:17:32.676 --> 00:17:33.719
Evil Russians.

296
00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:36.764
Yeah. exactly. I don't know
what an evil Russian looks like.

297
00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:39.308
- Tall. blond. not smiling.
- Mm-hmm?

298
00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:40.434
Also. look for earpieces.

299
00:17:40.517 --> 00:17:41.997
camo. duffel bags.
that sort of thing.

300
00:17:42.061 --> 00:17:43.562
Right. okay. duffel bags.

301
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.900
- Oh. you've gotta be kidding me.
- What?

302
00:17:47.983 --> 00:17:51.070
Anna Jacobi's talking
with that meathead Mark Lewinsky.

303
00:17:51.153 --> 00:17:53.233
If you're not gonna focus.
just gimme the binoculars.

304
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.365
Aw. Jesus Christ.
whatever happened to standards?

305
00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:58.077
I mean.
Lewinsky never even came off the bench.

306
00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.621
Dude. you are the worst spy in history.
you know that?

307
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:02.664
- Stop. hey. Stop.
- Give me those.

308
00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:06.126
I don't get why you're looking at girls.
You have the perfect one in front of you.

309
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.587
- Seriously. if you say Robin again...
- Robin.

310
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.547
- No. don't. No.
- Robin. Robin. Robin.

311
00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:11.983
- Stop. no. no. no.
- Robin. Robin.

312
00:18:12.007 --> 00:18:12.841
- Robin.
- No.

313
00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:13.759
- Robin.
- No!

314
00:18:13.842 --> 00:18:15.344
No. man. she's not my type.

315
00:18:15.427 --> 00:18:16.512
She's not even...

316
00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:19.473
in the ballpark of what my type is.
all right?

317
00:18:19.556 --> 00:18:21.809
What's your type again? Not awesome?

318
00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:24.019
- Thank you.
- Hm.

319
00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:27.231
For your information.
she's still in school. And she's weird.

320
00:18:27.397 --> 00:18:29.233
She's a weirdo. And she's hyper.

321
00:18:29.316 --> 00:18:30.651
I don't like that she's hyper.

322
00:18:30.734 --> 00:18:32.986
And she did drama.
That's a bad look.

323
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.321
And she's in band?

324
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.366
- No.
- Now that you're out of high school.

325
00:18:37.658 --> 00:18:40.828
which means you're technically an adult.
don't you think it's time you move on

326
00:18:40.911 --> 00:18:42.871
from primitive constructs
such as popularity?

327
00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:45.716
Oh. primitive constructs? That some
stupid shit you learned at Camp...

328
00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:46.959
Know... Nothing?

329
00:18:47.042 --> 00:18:48.168
Camp Know Where. actually.

330
00:18:48.252 --> 00:18:50.052
- And no. it's shit I learned from life.
- Hm.

331
00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:52.548
Instead of dating somebody
you think's gonna make you cooler.

332
00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:54.967
why not date somebody you actually enjoy
being around?

333
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.301
Like me and Suzie.

334
00:18:56.385 --> 00:18:57.385
Oh. Suzie.

335
00:18:57.427 --> 00:18:59.680
Yeah. you mean.
"hotter than Phoebe Cates."

336
00:18:59.763 --> 00:19:00.806
Yeah. that Suzie.

337
00:19:00.889 --> 00:19:03.183
And. uh. let's think about

338
00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:06.562
how exactly did you score
that beautiful girlfriend?

339
00:19:07.354 --> 00:19:09.064
Oh. yeah. With my advice.

340
00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:11.692
Because that's how this works. Henderson.

341
00:19:11.775 --> 00:19:14.862
I give you the advice. you follow through.

342
00:19:14.945 --> 00:19:16.905
Not the other way around.
all right. pea-brain?

343
00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:24.705
Do you guys hear that?

344
00:19:25.747 --> 00:19:27.541
It sounds like... thunder.

345
00:19:28.709 --> 00:19:31.587
But. no. wait. That's not thunder.

346
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:32.796
It's...

347
00:19:33.338 --> 00:19:34.965
a horde of juju zombies!

348
00:19:35.048 --> 00:19:36.758
Sir Mike. your action.

349
00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:38.551
What should I do?

350
00:19:39.386 --> 00:19:40.262
Attack?

351
00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:42.181
Okay. I attack with my flail.

352
00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:43.807
Whoosh!

353
00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:45.058
You miss.

354
00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:48.353
Your flail clanks the stone. the zombie
horde lumbers towards you. and...

355
00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:52.065
the juju bites your arm. Flesh tears!

356
00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:53.149
Aah!

357
00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:54.651
Seven points of damage.

358
00:19:54.735 --> 00:19:56.069
Oh. no. my arm.

359
00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:58.530
Lucas. look. my arm.

360
00:19:59.656 --> 00:20:02.534
Sir Lucas. the zombie horde roars!

361
00:20:02.618 --> 00:20:05.329
Do you fight back or do you run?

362
00:20:08.415 --> 00:20:09.750
No! It's a distraction!

363
00:20:09.833 --> 00:20:12.002
A trap. Do not answer it.

364
00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:15.338
What... No!

365
00:20:16.089 --> 00:20:16.924
El?

366
00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:18.007
No.

367
00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.801
Sorry. not interested.

368
00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:21.720
Telemarketers.

369
00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:23.513
Maybe we should just call them.

370
00:20:24.014 --> 00:20:24.932
We can do that?

371
00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:27.059
- I think so.
- Yeah. but what would we say?

372
00:20:27.142 --> 00:20:29.728
We'll say nothing! The Khuisar tribe
still needs your help.

373
00:20:29.811 --> 00:20:30.938
All right. then.

374
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:34.274
I'll use my torch to set fire
to the chambers. sacrificing ourselves.

375
00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:36.360
killing the jujus. and saving the Khuisar.

376
00:20:36.443 --> 00:20:39.196
We all live on as heroes
in the memories of the Kalamar.

377
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.780
Victory.

378
00:20:41.323 --> 00:20:42.866
Okay. Fine.

379
00:20:43.492 --> 00:20:44.910
You guys win.

380
00:20:44.993 --> 00:20:47.120
- Congratulations.
- Will. I was just messing around.

381
00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:50.040
Hey. let's finish for real.

382
00:20:50.123 --> 00:20:52.584
- How much longer is the campaign?
- Just forget it. Mike.

383
00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:54.544
No. you want to keep playing. right?

384
00:20:54.628 --> 00:20:56.338
Y-Yeah. totally.

385
00:20:56.421 --> 00:20:59.424
- We'll just call the girls afterwards.
- I said forget it. Mike. okay?

386
00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:01.802
- I'm going home.
- But...

387
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:03.470
- Come on. Will.
- Move!

388
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.436
Will. come on.

389
00:21:11.812 --> 00:21:13.105
You can't leave. It's raining.

390
00:21:13.647 --> 00:21:15.167
Listen. I said I was sorry. all right?

391
00:21:15.816 --> 00:21:17.901
It's a cool campaign. It's really cool.

392
00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:20.904
- We're just not in the mood right now.
- Yeah. Mike. That's the problem.

393
00:21:20.988 --> 00:21:22.572
You guys are never in the mood anymore.

394
00:21:22.656 --> 00:21:24.866
- You're ruining our party.
- That's not true.

395
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.952
Really? Where's Dustin right now?

396
00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:29.830
See? You don't know
and you don't even care.

397
00:21:29.913 --> 00:21:32.016
And obviously he doesn't either
and I don't blame him.

398
00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.042
You're destroying everything.
and for what?

399
00:21:34.126 --> 00:21:36.128
So you can swap spit
with some stupid girl?

400
00:21:36.211 --> 00:21:37.129
El's not stupid.

401
00:21:37.212 --> 00:21:39.131
It's not my fault you don't like girls.

402
00:21:43.719 --> 00:21:46.305
I'm not trying to be a jerk. Okay?

403
00:21:47.097 --> 00:21:48.307
But we're not kids anymore.

404
00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:50.475
I mean. what did you think. really?

405
00:21:51.018 --> 00:21:52.853
That we were never gonna get girlfriends?

406
00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.780
We were just gonna sit
in my basement all day

407
00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:56.481
and play games for the rest of our lives?

408
00:21:57.065 --> 00:21:57.899
Yeah.

409
00:21:59.109 --> 00:22:00.152
I guess I did.

410
00:22:01.194 --> 00:22:02.362
I really did.

411
00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:05.823
Will.

412
00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:07.200
Will!

413
00:22:07.617 --> 00:22:09.161
Will. come on!

414
00:22:28.638 --> 00:22:29.514
Excuse me.

415
00:22:29.598 --> 00:22:33.310
No one in the water
until 30 minutes after the last strike.

416
00:22:33.393 --> 00:22:35.145
And don't try and argue with me.

417
00:22:35.228 --> 00:22:37.272
You wanna get electrocuted.
go climb a tree.

418
00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:39.316
Yeah. we don't care.
We're not here to swim.

419
00:22:39.649 --> 00:22:41.026
Or get electrocuted.

420
00:22:41.109 --> 00:22:43.028
We found this.

421
00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:46.448
Does that belong to anybody?

422
00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:48.032
Oh. yeah.

423
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.534
That's Heather's.

424
00:22:49.618 --> 00:22:50.618
I'll get it back to her.

425
00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.121
We could give it back to her.

426
00:22:53.205 --> 00:22:54.122
You could.

427
00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:55.957
'Cept she's not here.

428
00:22:56.416 --> 00:22:57.626
Bailed on me today.

429
00:22:59.753 --> 00:23:00.753
What is this?

430
00:23:01.588 --> 00:23:03.340
You girls want a reward or somethin'?

431
00:23:04.007 --> 00:23:05.007
No.

432
00:23:05.217 --> 00:23:06.217
We're just...

433
00:23:06.676 --> 00:23:07.928
Good Samaritans.

434
00:23:22.401 --> 00:23:23.401
Heather.

435
00:23:24.694 --> 00:23:26.113
Do you think you can find her?

436
00:23:26.988 --> 00:23:27.989
No way!

437
00:24:22.836 --> 00:24:23.920
What do you see?

438
00:24:24.713 --> 00:24:25.713
A door.

439
00:24:26.923 --> 00:24:28.258
A red door.

440
00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:05.629
Help me.

441
00:25:09.883 --> 00:25:13.094
Help me!

442
00:25:18.099 --> 00:25:18.975
No!

443
00:25:20.101 --> 00:25:21.895
What happened? El!

444
00:25:51.299 --> 00:25:53.301
Hello?

445
00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:56.429
Anybody home?

446
00:25:58.598 --> 00:26:00.100
We come in peace.

447
00:26:13.446 --> 00:26:15.532
<i>No!</i>

448
00:26:24.207 --> 00:26:25.083
<i>No!</i>

449
00:26:25.166 --> 00:26:27.419
<i>Let's go!</i>

450
00:26:28.169 --> 00:26:29.169
Joyce.

451
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:31.630
You okay?

452
00:26:32.173 --> 00:26:33.173
I'm fine.

453
00:26:34.926 --> 00:26:36.094
You want to wait in the car?

454
00:26:36.803 --> 00:26:37.803
I said I'm fine.

455
00:27:11.671 --> 00:27:12.756
- Target acquired.
- Where?

456
00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.258
- Ten o'clock. Sam Goody's.
- Give me that.

457
00:27:16.635 --> 00:27:17.636
Shit.

458
00:27:18.762 --> 00:27:20.013
Duffel bag.

459
00:27:22.432 --> 00:27:23.642
Evil Russian.

460
00:27:37.238 --> 00:27:38.239
Slow down.

461
00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:39.449
We're losin' him.

462
00:27:39.532 --> 00:27:42.118
- You're getting too close.
- Watch it. dickwad.

463
00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:48.249
Hello. Yes. I am fine.

464
00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:49.333
How are you?

465
00:27:59.302 --> 00:28:01.346
All right. everyone. listen up!

466
00:28:02.472 --> 00:28:05.725
I just have one question for you.

467
00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:06.809
Who...

468
00:28:07.227 --> 00:28:08.853
is ready to sweat?

469
00:28:11.189 --> 00:28:12.189
That's right!

470
00:28:12.232 --> 00:28:14.776
Okay! Let's start it nice and easy now.

471
00:28:14.859 --> 00:28:16.569
Let's move our thighs. Yeah!

472
00:28:16.653 --> 00:28:19.293
Yeah. ladies. warm it up.

473
00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:20.573
Bring it down to your hips.

474
00:28:20.657 --> 00:28:22.075
Start feeling that burn.

475
00:28:22.158 --> 00:28:25.078
everywhere. down in the loins. right?

476
00:28:25.161 --> 00:28:26.871
Come on. ladies. show me what you got.

477
00:28:26.955 --> 00:28:29.290
Slow now. Just isolate.

478
00:28:29.457 --> 00:28:31.626
Ooh. tip that up. That feels good!

479
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.002
"The week is long.

480
00:28:33.253 --> 00:28:36.423
The silver cat feeds
when blue meets yellow in the west.

481
00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:40.135
A trip to China sounds nice
if you tread lightly."

482
00:28:42.554 --> 00:28:44.139
"Tread lightly"?

483
00:28:55.358 --> 00:28:57.068
- Delivery for you.
- Thank you.

484
00:29:08.872 --> 00:29:11.040
- Have a nice day.
- Yeah. you too.

485
00:29:17.338 --> 00:29:18.339
Silver cat.

486
00:29:18.923 --> 00:29:20.091
Silver cat.

487
00:29:20.175 --> 00:29:22.469
You're not gonna believe
who Dustin thought was a Russian.

488
00:29:22.552 --> 00:29:23.887
- You did too.
- No. I did not.

489
00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:25.805
- Yes. you did.
- No. I did not.

490
00:29:30.268 --> 00:29:32.061
"A trip to China sounds nice."

491
00:29:33.021 --> 00:29:35.190
A trip to China sounds nice.

492
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.275
A trip to China sounds nice.

493
00:29:38.651 --> 00:29:40.695
A trip to China sounds nice.

494
00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.782
A trip to China sounds nice.

495
00:29:45.533 --> 00:29:47.327
"If you tread lightly."

496
00:29:47.869 --> 00:29:49.078
If you tread...

497
00:29:49.162 --> 00:29:50.330
If you tread...

498
00:29:52.248 --> 00:29:53.792
If you tread lightly.

499
00:29:54.834 --> 00:29:57.670
"When... When blue and yellow
meet in the west."

500
00:29:58.171 --> 00:30:00.173
When blue meets yellow...

501
00:30:00.715 --> 00:30:01.758
in the west.

502
00:30:03.384 --> 00:30:04.469
Robin.

503
00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:06.303
What are you doing?

504
00:30:06.346 --> 00:30:07.866
- I cracked it.
- Cracked what?

505
00:30:09.766 --> 00:30:10.934
I cracked the code.

506
00:30:20.318 --> 00:30:22.237
Oh-ho-ho! Oh!

507
00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.320
There it is!

508
00:30:25.323 --> 00:30:27.992
Careful! It might have rabies!

509
00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:32.802
Better get that thing outta here.

510
00:30:32.872 --> 00:30:35.458
You don't want it eatin' the tires
off your car.

511
00:30:36.709 --> 00:30:37.752
Come on!

512
00:30:38.545 --> 00:30:39.629
What...

513
00:30:40.213 --> 00:30:41.923
- What's this?
- Proof.

514
00:30:42.006 --> 00:30:43.006
Proof?

515
00:30:43.049 --> 00:30:45.552
They said they wanted proof. right?
So let's give it to 'em.

516
00:30:45.635 --> 00:30:46.928
A rubber rat?

517
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:49.264
No. the real rat.

518
00:30:49.347 --> 00:30:51.140
Driscoll's rat.

519
00:30:51.224 --> 00:30:52.809
You said yourself it looked sick.

520
00:30:52.892 --> 00:30:54.572
We can take it
to an animal control center.

521
00:30:54.602 --> 00:30:56.042
they can run some blood tests on it.

522
00:30:56.104 --> 00:30:58.773
- figure out what's wrong with it...
- Whoa. Nancy. slow down.

523
00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:00.358
Tom didn't ask for proof.

524
00:31:00.441 --> 00:31:02.151
He asked us to drop the story.

525
00:31:02.235 --> 00:31:03.820
That's because he didn't believe us.

526
00:31:03.903 --> 00:31:04.737
Nancy.

527
00:31:04.821 --> 00:31:05.697
I'm right.

528
00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:06.823
That's not the point.

529
00:31:06.906 --> 00:31:07.906
Then what's the point?

530
00:31:07.949 --> 00:31:10.269
You should've thought about that
before you talked to them.

531
00:31:10.326 --> 00:31:12.046
All right? They're assholes. okay?
I get it.

532
00:31:12.078 --> 00:31:13.580
But it's just some stupid story.

533
00:31:13.663 --> 00:31:15.039
Oh. it's stupid?

534
00:31:15.123 --> 00:31:16.374
It's stupid to get fired over.

535
00:31:16.457 --> 00:31:18.293
No one's going to fire us.

536
00:31:20.628 --> 00:31:22.797
Look. if you don't want to go.
that's fine.

537
00:31:23.673 --> 00:31:24.673
Just...

538
00:31:25.967 --> 00:31:26.968
give me the keys.

539
00:31:29.554 --> 00:31:31.014
You're relentless. you know that?

540
00:31:33.433 --> 00:31:34.433
Come on.

541
00:32:06.633 --> 00:32:07.717
Nobody's home.

542
00:32:10.219 --> 00:32:12.472
All the cavities
have been filled.

543
00:32:16.976 --> 00:32:18.728
I watched 'em do it. Joyce.

544
00:32:21.314 --> 00:32:22.315
Will!

545
00:32:27.028 --> 00:32:28.112
It's over.

546
00:32:33.326 --> 00:32:34.369
It's over.

547
00:32:37.997 --> 00:32:41.084
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

548
00:32:41.834 --> 00:32:44.337
You're not losing your mind.

549
00:32:46.673 --> 00:32:47.966
Not any more than I am.

550
00:32:49.258 --> 00:32:52.470
You know. the other day.
I almost shot Betsy Payne's dog

551
00:32:52.553 --> 00:32:54.993
because it came rushing at me
from behind this fence. and I...

552
00:32:55.515 --> 00:32:58.142
I swear to God. I thought it was
one of those things.

553
00:33:00.937 --> 00:33:03.773
You know that I'm keeping
a close eye on things. right?

554
00:33:03.856 --> 00:33:06.317
- Yeah.
- Because it's important to me.

555
00:33:06.943 --> 00:33:09.821
It is important to me that you feel safe.

556
00:33:10.488 --> 00:33:12.532
That you and your family feel safe.

557
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.618
I want you to feel

558
00:33:16.411 --> 00:33:18.413
like this can still be your home.

559
00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:21.999
What?

560
00:33:23.918 --> 00:33:25.962
You didn't think I'd find out about that?

561
00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:27.755
Gary called me.

562
00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:31.843
He said he's fixing up your house
to put on the market.

563
00:33:35.972 --> 00:33:37.265
The kids know yet?

564
00:33:46.774 --> 00:33:48.234
After Sarah...

565
00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:52.405
I had to get away.

566
00:33:57.201 --> 00:33:59.328
I had to get the hell out of that place.
you know?

567
00:34:00.955 --> 00:34:02.331
Outrun those. uh...

568
00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:04.709
those memories. I guess.

569
00:34:08.838 --> 00:34:11.424
I mean. why do you think
I ended up back in this shithole?

570
00:34:14.385 --> 00:34:16.387
But you have something that I never had.

571
00:34:18.097 --> 00:34:20.266
You have people that know
what you've been through.

572
00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:22.101
You have people that care about you.

573
00:34:23.519 --> 00:34:24.519
Right here.

574
00:34:25.688 --> 00:34:26.814
In Hawkins.

575
00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.401
You mean...

576
00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:32.987
You mean. people like Scott Clarke.

577
00:34:35.364 --> 00:34:36.991
That was a joke.

578
00:34:40.161 --> 00:34:41.537
Mm.

579
00:34:46.459 --> 00:34:47.502
What's that?

580
00:34:50.254 --> 00:34:51.254
Wait here.

581
00:35:18.199 --> 00:35:19.199
Will!

582
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.244
Will. I'm sorry. man. all right?

583
00:35:21.327 --> 00:35:22.995
I was being a total asshole.

584
00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:24.999
Please. can you just come outside
and we'll talk?

585
00:35:26.749 --> 00:35:27.749
Will!

586
00:35:28.543 --> 00:35:30.086
Hey. Will!

587
00:35:30.461 --> 00:35:32.630

592
00:36:03.619 --> 00:36:06.664
Oh. Jesus. we're so screwed
if it's the Demogorgon.

593
00:36:06.747 --> 00:36:07.790
It's not the Demogorgon.

594

Oh. she must not be home.

605
00:37:37.255 --> 00:37:39.757
She's an 80-year-old woman
and it's pouring.

606

Where else would she be?

607
00:37:45.346 --> 00:37:47.890
- Whoa. what are you doing?
- Maybe she fell.

608
00:37:48.307 --> 00:37:49.307
Or something.

609
00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:51.810

Mrs. Driscoll?

616
00:39:19.523 --> 00:39:21.984

- Guns. bombs?

619
00:39:33.412 --> 00:39:34.412
Chemical weapons?

620
00:39:34.455 --> 00:39:36.624
Whatever it is.
they're armed to the teeth.

621
00:39:36.749 --> 00:39:38.417
Great.

622
00:39:39.001 --> 00:39:40.001
That's great.

623
00:39:44.215 --> 00:39:45.716
Hey. what's in there?

624
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.301
It's just more boxes.

625
00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:48.761
Let me check it out.

626
00:39:48.844 --> 00:39:50.404
- No. I'm still looking.
- Lemme see it.

627
00:39:50.429 --> 00:39:51.680
Hang on!

628
00:39:51.764 --> 00:39:52.890

Stay here.

630
00:40:13.786 --> 00:40:14.954
Watch the door.

631
00:40:27.049 --> 00:40:28.843
Well. I think we found your Russians.

632
00:40:52.533 --> 00:40:55.536
This is Hawkins Chief of Police!
Come out with your hands up!

633

639
00:42:32.591 --> 00:42:34.843
- This is her house.
- What?

640
00:42:35.553 --> 00:42:36.637
Heather's house.

641
00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:42.768
Isn't that cute. huh?

642
00:42:45.563 --> 00:42:46.855
He's so funny.

Max.

644
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:53.988
We didn't mean to... barge in.

645
00:42:54.488 --> 00:42:57.616
We tried to knock. but...
maybe you didn't hear us over the storm.

646
00:42:58.701 --> 00:43:01.301
I'm sorry. who is this dripping
all over my living room right now?

647
00:43:02.371 --> 00:43:03.371
I'm sorry.

648
00:43:03.872 --> 00:43:05.749
Janet. Tom.

649
00:43:05.833 --> 00:43:06.833
this...

650
00:43:07.543 --> 00:43:09.295
is my sister. Maxine.

651
00:43:09.378 --> 00:43:10.629
Oh!

652
00:43:10.713 --> 00:43:12.590
What on earth are you doing here?

653
00:43:13.132 --> 00:43:14.132
Is something wrong?

654
00:43:14.174 --> 00:43:16.385
We just wanted to make sure
everything was okay.

655
00:43:16.468 --> 00:43:17.636
Okay?

656
00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:20.598
- Why wouldn't it be okay?
- Where is she?

657
00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.100
I'm sorry.

658
00:43:24.643 --> 00:43:26.186
Where is who?

659
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:28.397
Well. they're a little burnt. I'm sorry...

660
00:43:29.189 --> 00:43:31.817
Heather! This is my sister. Maxine.

661
00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:35.738
And. I'm sorry.
I did not quite catch your name.

662
00:43:37.031 --> 00:43:38.031
El.

663
00:43:39.325 --> 00:43:40.325
El.

664
00:43:41.035 --> 00:43:43.245
Now. what is it you were saying. El?

665
00:43:43.912 --> 00:43:45.914
You were looking for somebody?

666
00:43:48.917 --> 00:43:50.044
I... I saw...

667
00:43:50.294 --> 00:43:52.504
- I saw you...
- Your manager. At the pool.

668
00:43:52.588 --> 00:43:55.148
He said you guys didn't come in
to work today. so we got worried.

669
00:43:55.174 --> 00:43:56.967
Heather wasn't feeling so hot today.

670
00:43:57.051 --> 00:44:00.512
so we thought we'd take the day off
to nurse her back to health.

671
00:44:00.596 --> 00:44:03.474
But you're feeling just fine right now.
aren't you. Heather?

672
00:44:03.557 --> 00:44:04.892
I'm feeling so much better.

673
00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:08.312
Do you girls want a cookie?

674
00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:10.856
They're fresh out of the oven.
