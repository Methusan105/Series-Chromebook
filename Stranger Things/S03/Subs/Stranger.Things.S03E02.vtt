00:01:10.653 --> 00:01:12.363
<i>911. what's your emergency?</i>

2
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:21.501
<i>Is someone there? Hello?</i>

3
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.019
What do you want?

4
00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.441
Hey! I said. what do you want?

5
00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.988
I said. what do you want?

6
00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.461
Hey. Is everything okay?

7
00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:32.544
Yes.

8
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.927
Hello. this is the Wheelers.

9
00:03:40.428 --> 00:03:41.512
Yeah. just a sec.

10
00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:42.889
Mike!

11
00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:44.015
Phone!

12
00:03:44.098 --> 00:03:45.183
Okay!

13
00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:54.234
Hello?

14
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.904
It's 9:32. Where are you?

15
00:03:57.987 --> 00:03:59.781
Sorry. I... I was just about to call.

16
00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:01.032
<i>I. um...</i>

17
00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:03.534
can't see you today.

18
00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.161
What... Why not?

19
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.371
It's my Nana.

20
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.456
She's very sick.

21
00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:11.584
But Hop said that your Nana was okay.

22
00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:13.086
<i>that it was a false alarm.</i>

23
00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:14.796
<i>Yeah.</i>

24
00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.966
That's... what...
we thought it was at first.

25
00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.385
<i>but then she took a real turn
for the worse.</i>

26
00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:21.970
- Oh.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

27
00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:23.888
We think she might...

28
00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.015
- die.
- What?

29
00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:28.768
Mom! Get off the phone!

30
00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:30.353
<i>How many times?!</i>

31
00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:31.604
Did Nana call?!

32
00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:35.233
No. Mom! Just get off the phone!

33
00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:41.281
Sorry about that.

34
00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:43.116
- Was that your mom?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

35
00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.326
She's so upset. she's making no sense.

36
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.370
<i>Because we have to go to the nursing home.</i>

37
00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:48.579
To see Nana.

38
00:04:49.163 --> 00:04:50.873
- You can come over after?
- No!

39
00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.166
<i>I mean. I...</i>

40
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.712
I just think... I need to be alone today.

41
00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:57.879
With my...

42
00:04:58.548 --> 00:04:59.632
feelings?

43
00:05:00.174 --> 00:05:01.092
Do you lie?

44
00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:02.927
What? No.

45
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.470
<i>Friends don't lie.</i>

46
00:05:05.596 --> 00:05:06.639
What. Mom?

47
00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.059
My mom's calling me. Better go.

48
00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.863
Talk to you tomorrow.
Miss you already. Bye!

49
00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:20.694
Hey.

50
00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:22.280
What's going on?

51
00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:39.964
<i>♪ And they say

Emotions have been shared.

Boundaries have been set.

62
00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:15.166
Order...

63
00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:16.959
has been...

64
00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.213
- restored.
- Wait. wait. it worked?

65
00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:21.923
Uh. this is the first day

66
00:06:22.006 --> 00:06:25.301
in six long. excruciating months

67
00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:28.054
that they will not be seeing each other.

68
00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:31.933
Yes. I think it worked! Yes!

69
00:06:34.143 --> 00:06:35.143
No. stop.

70
00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:36.521
It's all you.

71
00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:38.481
I'm a puppet. you're the master.

72
00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:40.316
So you remembered everything?

73
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.026
Yeah. yeah.

74
00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:45.154
I mean. I had to improvise a little bit.
you know?

75
00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.864
It turns out. getting to Mike.

76
00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:48.116
now that was the key.

77
00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:49.951
And you didn't yell at him?

78
00:06:50.284 --> 00:06:52.286
I'll tell you everything over dinner.

79
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.497
I was thinking. you know. Enzo's.
tonight. 7:00.

80
00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:56.874
Hey. before you say no.

81
00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.043
I'd... I'd like to make one thing
crystal clear.

82
00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:01.462
This is not a date.

83
00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:02.672
Wait. a date?

84
00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:04.903
You never said anything about a date.

85
00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:06.926
I know.
I <i>didn't </i>say anything about a date.

86
00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:09.905
I just wanted to clear it up in case
there was any confusion on your part.

87
00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:11.055
- There's not.
- Great.

88
00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:13.433
It's just two friends
getting together for a nice dinner.

89
00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:15.476
I mean. we've earned it. haven't we?

90
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.727
I can't be out late.

91
00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:17.811
You'll be home by 9:00.

92
00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:19.313
- 8:00.
- 8:30. I'll pick you up.

93
00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:22.316
- I'll meet you there.
- 7:00. Enzo's. Meeting there.

94
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.484
Deal.

95
00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:25.796
<i>Hey. Chief. you copy? Chief!</i>

96
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.280
Yeah. I'm a little busy right now.

97
00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:28.448
Recall the mall!

98
00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:30.575
- Yeah. well. I'm busier here.
- Recall the mall!

99
00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:31.978
You wanna keep your job tomorrow.

100
00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:35.163
I think you need to get your ass
to Town Hall. Now.

101
00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:39.625
Duty calls.

102
00:07:40.501 --> 00:07:42.044
Oh! Jeez.

103
00:07:43.212 --> 00:07:44.380
Cleanup on aisle five.

104
00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:46.841
- Bye.
- See you tonight.

105
00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:22.542
Oh. shit. shit.

106
00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:24.462
Whoopsie-daisy!

107
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:29.133
Careful there. Nancy Drew. Careful.

108
00:08:31.385 --> 00:08:33.304
Pouring coffee's
a tough gig. girl.

109
00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:39.143
And here you are. two creams. two sugars.

110
00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.102
Thanks. sweetheart.

111
00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:41.312
Of course.

112
00:08:43.564 --> 00:08:44.649
- Tom?
- Hm?

113
00:08:44.732 --> 00:08:46.192
I really hate to ask this.

114
00:08:46.275 --> 00:08:49.612
but do you think one of the other girls
could run and grab lunch today?

115
00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:52.615
They're needed at their desks.

116
00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:54.408
I know. I just. um...

117
00:08:54.992 --> 00:08:56.702
I really need to go to the doctor.

118
00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.121
I've been having some...

119
00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:00.205
um...

120
00:09:00.998 --> 00:09:01.916
girl problems.

121
00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:08.798
- Oh. come on! The light!
- Let's go.

122
00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:11.092
Look. I just...

123
00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:13.970
I just don't know
if this is such a good idea anymore.

124
00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:16.847
Really? Because I feel like
it's the best idea I've had all summer.

125
00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:20.142
Look. all I'm saying is.
what harm is there in asking?

126
00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:22.562
The harm in asking
is that Tom will say no.

127
00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.605
We ask for forgiveness. not permission.

128
00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:27.942
And if this story's as good as I think
it's gonna be. then Tom won't care.

129
00:09:28.025 --> 00:09:29.610
In fact. he'll thank us.

130
00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:31.070
Or the old lady is nuts

131
00:09:31.153 --> 00:09:32.655
and the story blows up in our face

132
00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:34.448
and Tom fires us.

133
00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:36.993
And then we never have to work
at this shithole again.

I'm Dustin.

I'm Robin.

145
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.154
Pleasure to meet you. Uh. is... is he here?

146
00:10:13.237 --> 00:10:14.739
Is who here?

147
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.074
Henderson.

148
00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:19.952
Henderson! He's back!

149
00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:21.287
- He's back!
- I'm back!

150
00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:22.370
You got the job!

151
00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:23.873
I got the job!

152
00:10:23.956 --> 00:10:25.958
Hey! Oh!

153
00:10:32.673 --> 00:10:33.883
Ah!

154
00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:35.968
How many children are you friends with?

155
00:10:40.264 --> 00:10:41.807
No. no. No way.

156
00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:43.643
- Hotter than Phoebe Cates? No.
- Mm-hmm.

157
00:10:44.393 --> 00:10:47.938
Brilliant. too. And she doesn't even care
that my real pearls are still coming in.

158
00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:49.982
She says kissing is better without teeth.

159
00:10:52.943 --> 00:10:55.237
Wow. Yeah. that's great.
Proud of you. man.

160
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.073
That's ro... That's kinda romantic.

161
00:10:57.156 --> 00:10:58.616
- That's like... Wow.
- Hm.

162
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.786
So do you really just get to eat
as much of this as you want?

163
00:11:02.453 --> 00:11:05.164
Yeah. I mean. sure. It's not really
a good idea for me. though.

164
00:11:05.247 --> 00:11:08.393
- I gotta keep in shape for the ladies.
- Yeah. and how's that working out for you?

165
00:11:08.417 --> 00:11:09.877
- Ignore her.
- She seems cool.

166
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.505
She's not.
So. where are the other knuckleheads?

167
00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:14.256
They ditched me yesterday.

168
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.925
- No.
- My first day back.

169
00:11:16.008 --> 00:11:17.968
- Can you believe that shit?
- Whoa. Seriously?

170
00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:19.303
I swear to God. Mm.

171
00:11:20.596 --> 00:11:24.600
They're gonna regret it. though. big time.
when they don't get to share in my glory.

172
00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:27.144
Glory? What glory?

173
00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:30.815
So. last night.

174
00:11:31.482 --> 00:11:33.202
we're trying to get in contact
with Suzie...

175
00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:34.068
Oh. Mm.

176
00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:35.152
- Mm-hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

177
00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:36.236
And. uh...

178
00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:38.781
...and the orange sherbert
and chocolate.

179
00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:43.744
I intercepted a secret
Russian communication.

180
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:46.664
What?

181
00:11:46.747 --> 00:11:47.998
Uh...

182
00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:53.963
I intercepted a secret
Russian communication.

183
00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:55.774
- Just speak louder.
- I intercepted

184
00:11:55.798 --> 00:11:57.675
a secret Russian communication!

185
00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:00.761
Jeez. shh. Yeah. okay.
that's what I thought you said.

186
00:12:02.638 --> 00:12:03.758
What... What does that mean?

187
00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:06.642
It means. Steve. we could be heroes.

188
00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:10.062
True American heroes.

189
00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:11.814
- Huh.
- Mm-hmm?

190
00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:14.275
- American heroes.
- Just think.

191
00:12:14.358 --> 00:12:18.446
you could have all the ladies you want
and more.

192
00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:19.739
- More?
- More.

193
00:12:20.322 --> 00:12:21.615
- I like more.
- Mm-hmm.

194
00:12:23.492 --> 00:12:24.326
What's the catch?

195
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.454
No catch. I just need your help.

196
00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:27.537
With what?

197
00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:32.834
Translation.

198
00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:44.889
Shit!

199
00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:57.276
Hi.

200
00:12:58.277 --> 00:12:59.277
Hi?

201
00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:01.989
Can we talk?

202
00:13:02.573 --> 00:13:05.159
And then he said he... he missed me.

203
00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:07.495
And then he just hung up.

204
00:13:07.578 --> 00:13:09.789
- He's a piece of shit.
- What?

205
00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:13.501
Mike doesn't have jack shit to do today.
and his Nana obviously isn't sick.

206
00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:16.086
I guarantee you. him and Lucas
are playing Atari right now.

207
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.671
But friends don't lie.

208
00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:20.049
Yeah. well. boyfriends lie.

209
00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:22.343
All the time.

210
00:13:22.426 --> 00:13:24.762
She knows I'm lying. She <i>knows </i>I'm lying.

211
00:13:24.845 --> 00:13:27.640
- I don't even understand. Why lie?
- Hopper.

212
00:13:27.723 --> 00:13:29.016
He threatened me.

213
00:13:29.099 --> 00:13:31.393
- Did he say he'd kill you?
- What? No.

214
00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:33.479
- So then. what's the big deal?
- The big deal is

215
00:13:33.562 --> 00:13:36.190
if I don't do what he says.
then he'll stop me from seeing El.

216
00:13:36.273 --> 00:13:37.483
Like. permanently.

217
00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:40.528
You don't understand. Lucas. He's crazy.

218
00:13:41.111 --> 00:13:42.363
He's lost his mind.

219
00:13:42.446 --> 00:13:44.073
Hey. guys. I'm almost set up here.

220
00:13:44.156 --> 00:13:46.116
I had no choice. Lucas.
I really had no choice.

221
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.743
I just wish you'd consulted me.

222
00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.703
because the way you handled this.

223
00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:51.371
you're in deep shit.

224
00:13:51.872 --> 00:13:54.708
You're going to stop calling him.
You're going to ignore his calls.

225
00:13:54.792 --> 00:13:56.552
As far as you're concerned.
he doesn't exist.

226
00:13:56.627 --> 00:13:57.795
Doesn't exist?

227
00:13:57.878 --> 00:13:59.547
He treated you like garbage.

228
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.550
You're gonna treat him like garbage.
Give him a taste of his own medicine.

229
00:14:03.008 --> 00:14:04.760
Give him the medicine.

230
00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:07.096
Mm-hmm. And if he doesn't fix this.

231
00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:08.889
if he doesn't explain himself.

232
00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:10.140
dump his ass.

233
00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:14.562
I'm not gonna lie. it's gonna be bad.

234
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:17.565
But...

235
00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:19.650
you can fix this.

236
00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:22.027
It's just one little mistake.

237
00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:24.321
I've made hundreds. thousands.

238
00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:26.949
Max has dumped me five times.

239
00:14:27.032 --> 00:14:28.033
But what have I done?

240
00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:30.953
Huh? Have I despaired? No.

241
00:14:31.412 --> 00:14:33.038
I've marched back into battle.

242
00:14:33.122 --> 00:14:37.501
and I've won her back
every single freaking time.

243
00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:39.670
- How?
- I'll show you.

244
00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:41.338
Come on.

245
00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:42.339
Come on.

246
00:14:42.423 --> 00:14:44.800
- Where are we going?
- To have some fun.

247
00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.764
There's more to life than stupid boys.
you know.

248
00:14:48.512 --> 00:14:49.512
Wait. guys!

249
00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:51.181
I'm still here!

250
00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:54.226
Guys?

251
00:15:01.942 --> 00:15:04.820
Hey! No dunking. Curtis.

252
00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:06.613
No...

253
00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:08.073
dunking.

254
00:15:08.782 --> 00:15:11.994
God. even her voice annoys me.

255
00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:13.537
Nails on a chalkboard.

256
00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:16.332
Don't worry. ladies.
ten more minutes till showtime.

257
00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:19.335
Liz. will you get my back?

261
00:15:29.678 --> 00:15:32.238
Hey. Jill. I gotta use the restroom.
Will you watch Holly for me?

262
00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:33.390
- Sure thing. hon.
- Thanks.

263
00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:40.897
Billy?

264
00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:53.493
Billy?

265
00:15:58.374 --> 00:15:59.374
I...

266
00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:03.170
I understand if you're angry with me.

267
00:16:04.171 --> 00:16:05.171
I just...

268
00:16:06.048 --> 00:16:07.549
I wanted to explain...

269
00:16:10.302 --> 00:16:11.982
...why I didn't come last night.

270
00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:15.599
It's not you. it's just...

271
00:16:16.934 --> 00:16:18.268
I have a family.

272
00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:23.857
And I can't do anything
that will hurt them.

273
00:16:25.734 --> 00:16:27.361
You can understand that. right?

274
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.080
But I shouldn't have said that...

275
00:16:35.285 --> 00:16:36.453
<i>Billy.</i>

276
00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:40.123
Billy...

277
00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:42.751
Please. will you talk to me?

278
00:16:45.963 --> 00:16:47.756
Stay away from me. Karen.

279
00:17:09.945 --> 00:17:12.364
Looking good. Billy.

280
00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:16.869
Afternoon. Billy.

281
00:17:41.351 --> 00:17:42.394
Mmm.

282
00:17:44.354 --> 00:17:45.689
Can I try the peppermint stick?

283
00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:47.941
Haven't you already tried
the peppermint stick?

284
00:17:48.525 --> 00:17:50.903
Yes. and I'd like to try it again.

285
00:17:52.237 --> 00:17:53.322
Steve!

286
00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:04.750
So what do you think?

287
00:18:04.833 --> 00:18:06.710
- It sounded familiar.
- What?

288
00:18:06.794 --> 00:18:09.505
The music.
The music right there at the end.

289
00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:11.632
Why are you listening to the music. Steve?

290
00:18:11.715 --> 00:18:12.716
Listen to the Russian!

291
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.469
- We're translating Russian!
- I'm trying to listen to the Russian.

292
00:18:15.552 --> 00:18:17.864
- but there's music...
- All right. babysitting time is over.

293
00:18:17.888 --> 00:18:18.931
You need to get in there.

294
00:18:19.014 --> 00:18:21.934
Hey. my board.
That was important data. shitbirds.

295
00:18:22.017 --> 00:18:25.479
I guarantee you. what we're doing
is way more important than your data.

296
00:18:25.562 --> 00:18:28.649
Yeah? And how do you know these Russians
are up to no good anyways?

297
00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:31.461
- How does she know about the Russians?
- I don't know.

298
00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:33.004
- You told her about...
- It wasn't me.

299
00:18:33.028 --> 00:18:36.156
Hello. I can hear you.
Actually. I can hear everything.

300
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.450
You are both extremely loud.

301
00:18:39.034 --> 00:18:42.329
You think you have evil Russians
plotting against our country. on tape.

302
00:18:42.412 --> 00:18:44.852
and you're trying to translate.
but haven't figured out a word

303
00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:47.751
because you didn't realize Russians
use an entirely different alphabet.

304
00:18:48.627 --> 00:18:49.627
Sound about right?

305
00:18:51.713 --> 00:18:53.900
- Whoa! What do you think you're doing?
- I wanna hear it.

306
00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:55.926
- Why?
- 'Cause maybe I can help.

307
00:18:56.343 --> 00:18:58.720
- I'm fluent in four languages. you know.
- Russian?

308
00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:00.597
<i>Ou-yay are-yay umb-day.</i>

309
00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:02.015
Oh-ho-ho!

310
00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:02.933
Holy shit!

311
00:19:03.016 --> 00:19:04.560
That was Pig Latin. dingus.

312
00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:07.354
- Idiot.
- But I can speak Spanish

313
00:19:07.437 --> 00:19:10.399
and French and Italian.
and I've been in band for 12 years.

314
00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:12.985
- My ears are little geniuses. trust me.
- Uh...

315
00:19:13.068 --> 00:19:15.696
Come on. it's your turn
to sling ice cream. my turn to translate.

316
00:19:15.779 --> 00:19:17.948
I don't even want credit. I'm just bored.

317
00:19:37.926 --> 00:19:38.926
Yes?

318
00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:41.180
- Mrs. Driscoll?
- Yes?

319
00:19:41.263 --> 00:19:43.056
Hi. um. I'm Nancy.

320
00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:46.226
Nancy Wheeler.
We spoke briefly on the phone last night.

321
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.436
We're from <i>The Hawkins Post.</i>

322
00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:49.146
Oh! Oh. yes!

323
00:19:49.229 --> 00:19:50.439
Oh. my goodness.

324
00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:53.108
Oh. You look too young for reporters.

325
00:19:53.984 --> 00:19:55.824
We get that a lot.

326
00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:56.861
Follow me.

327
00:19:57.863 --> 00:20:00.032
Oh. it's... it's lovely.

328
00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:03.535
Um. do you live here all alone?

329
00:20:03.785 --> 00:20:05.829
Yes. Jack. my husband.

330
00:20:05.913 --> 00:20:09.541
he passed away. what is it now.
ten years ago.

331
00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:12.502
Oh. um... I'm... I'm so sorry.

332
00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:14.213
Oh. don't be.

333
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.298
I kinda like the quiet.

334
00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:18.425
At least. I did.

335
00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:21.887
This way.

336
00:20:32.189 --> 00:20:33.690
It's right over there.

337
00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:52.417
You see those
little teeth marks. don't ya?

338
00:20:56.463 --> 00:20:57.463
And...

339
00:20:57.714 --> 00:20:58.840
these bags. um...

340
00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:01.343
you're sure they were full before?

341
00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:02.844
I'm old. honey. not senile.

342
00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:06.974
Bought them over at Blackburn's Supplies
just last Tuesday.

343
00:21:07.057 --> 00:21:08.225
Now you tell me.

344
00:21:08.308 --> 00:21:11.728
why would rats want to eat
a poor old woman's fertilizer?

345
00:21:11.812 --> 00:21:12.980
Are you sure they did?

346
00:21:13.897 --> 00:21:17.276
Maybe they just gnawed the bag? I mean...

347
00:21:17.901 --> 00:21:19.278
eating fertilizer seems...

348
00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:21.363
Crazy. Believe me. I know. honey.

349
00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:23.323
But...

350
00:21:23.407 --> 00:21:25.701
...something's not right with these rats.

351
00:21:25.784 --> 00:21:27.286
What does that mean. exactly...

352
00:21:28.161 --> 00:21:28.996
"not right"?

353
00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:31.123
Rabies. my guess.

354
00:21:31.665 --> 00:21:32.825
That's when I said to myself.

355
00:21:32.874 --> 00:21:34.876
"Doris. you gotta call the paper.

356
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.213
Because if those diseased rats
are runnin' loose.

357
00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:40.924
the people. they oughta know."
Wouldn't you agree?

358
00:21:43.176 --> 00:21:45.637
Oh. yes. I forgot to mention!

359
00:21:46.513 --> 00:21:47.848
Come on over here.

360
00:21:52.185 --> 00:21:53.979
I caught one of the little bastards.

361
00:22:00.902 --> 00:22:03.905
Kline's a swine!
Kline's a swine!

362
00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:05.198
Kline's a swine!

363
00:22:05.282 --> 00:22:08.410
Kline's a swine! Kline's a swine!

364
00:22:10.704 --> 00:22:13.248
Kline's a swine!
Kline's a swine!

365
00:22:13.749 --> 00:22:15.083
Kline's a swine!

366
00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:16.460
Kline's a swine!

367
00:22:17.044 --> 00:22:18.295
Kline's a swine!

368
00:22:18.378 --> 00:22:19.588
Kline's a swine!

369
00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:23.007
Jim?

370
00:22:23.216 --> 00:22:24.718
Mayor Kline is ready for you.

371
00:22:26.887 --> 00:22:27.887
Great.

372
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:30.890
Thank you.

373
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.642
Jim.

374
00:22:33.727 --> 00:22:35.812
Thanks for coming by.

375
00:22:35.896 --> 00:22:37.189
I'm not doing it. Larry.

376
00:22:38.398 --> 00:22:40.942
Calm down. now.
You don't even know what I want.

377
00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:44.196
You don't like your fan club. you want me
to shut 'em down. Sound about right?

378
00:22:44.279 --> 00:22:46.656
When'd you get so serious?

379
00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:48.784
Take a seat.

380
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:57.167
My fan club. as you call them.

381
00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.211
now. you know why they're out there.
don't ya?

382
00:22:59.294 --> 00:23:00.754
They're not actually fans?

383
00:23:02.172 --> 00:23:03.924
They lost their jobs to the mall

384
00:23:04.007 --> 00:23:06.134
and blame me for helping make that happen.

385
00:23:06.218 --> 00:23:07.052
Now.

386
00:23:07.135 --> 00:23:09.054
you go ask anyone else in this town.

387
00:23:09.304 --> 00:23:10.555
They all love the mall.

388
00:23:10.639 --> 00:23:13.183
It's helped our economy grow.
brought in new jobs.

389
00:23:13.266 --> 00:23:15.227
and just some incredible new stores.

390
00:23:15.811 --> 00:23:19.981
Which is why they all stopped shopping
at their. uh. mom-and-pops.

391
00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:21.608
Now. that's not me. Jim.

392
00:23:21.691 --> 00:23:22.609
- Mm-hmm?
- Uh-uh.

393
00:23:22.692 --> 00:23:25.237
That's just. uh. good old fashioned
American capitalism.

394
00:23:25.737 --> 00:23:27.823
Well. Larry.
I think that they're just exercising

395
00:23:27.906 --> 00:23:31.451
their good old fashioned American right
to protest.

396
00:23:31.535 --> 00:23:33.328
I agree.

397
00:23:33.412 --> 00:23:35.080
- Yeah.
- If.

398
00:23:36.373 --> 00:23:37.707
If they had a permit.

399
00:23:38.333 --> 00:23:40.419
Now. correct me if I'm wrong here. Jim.
but. uh...

400
00:23:41.336 --> 00:23:43.630
I don't believe they secured a permit
from your office.

401
00:23:44.548 --> 00:23:45.548
did they?

402
00:23:46.508 --> 00:23:47.676
Not that I'm aware of.

403
00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:50.971
Then I do believe it's within my right
to get rid of them.

404
00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:52.930
Larry.

405
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:54.641
I'm not a politics guy.

406
00:23:54.724 --> 00:23:58.311
but I think if you force those people
out of here without provocation.

407
00:23:58.395 --> 00:24:01.022
I don't think that's a good look
for your re-election campaign.

408
00:24:04.443 --> 00:24:05.902
You know what's in four days. Jim?

409
00:24:07.154 --> 00:24:08.321
Independence Day?

410
00:24:08.405 --> 00:24:09.405
That's right.

411
00:24:09.448 --> 00:24:12.200
And I'm gonna throw this town
the biggest bash it's ever seen.

412
00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:14.578
Fireworks. music. activities. you name it.

413
00:24:14.661 --> 00:24:16.663
I'm gonna pull out all the stops.
You know why?

414
00:24:17.539 --> 00:24:20.709
'Cause at the end of the day.
that's all the voters will remember.

415
00:24:21.793 --> 00:24:24.713
But I can't think. much less plan.

416
00:24:25.172 --> 00:24:27.466
with all that racket going on out there.

417
00:24:28.341 --> 00:24:30.218
So. if you don't mind.

418
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:33.013
please...

419
00:24:33.096 --> 00:24:34.639
just do your job.

420
00:24:35.223 --> 00:24:37.642
Flash your little gold badge.

421
00:24:37.726 --> 00:24:39.019
and get rid of them.

422
00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:50.697
So. what do you think?

423
00:24:53.992 --> 00:24:54.993
Hey. what's wrong?

424
00:24:55.702 --> 00:24:56.870
Too many people.

425
00:24:57.537 --> 00:24:58.788
Against the rules.

426
00:24:59.456 --> 00:25:00.582
Seriously?

427
00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:02.459
You have superpowers.

428
00:25:02.542 --> 00:25:03.960
What's the worst that could happen?

429
00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:22.437
So. what should we do first?

430
00:25:24.272 --> 00:25:26.983
You've never been
shopping before. have you?

431
00:25:28.443 --> 00:25:31.029
Well. then I guess we're just
gonna have to try everything.

432
00:25:31.988 --> 00:25:33.073
Ooh. Come on.

433
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.541
I just...
I don't understand what we're looking for.

434
00:25:42.624 --> 00:25:45.794
Something pretty and shiny
that says "I'm sorry."

435
00:25:45.877 --> 00:25:47.939
What. just something
that literally says "I'm sorry"?

436
00:25:47.963 --> 00:25:48.963
No!

437
00:26:00.267 --> 00:26:01.267
Do you like that?

438
00:26:01.726 --> 00:26:04.479
How do I know... what I like?

439
00:26:04.563 --> 00:26:06.439
You just try things on.

440
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.609
Until you find something
that feels like you.

441
00:26:11.027 --> 00:26:12.237
Like me?

442
00:26:12.946 --> 00:26:13.946
Yeah.

443
00:26:14.489 --> 00:26:15.489
Not Hopper.

444
00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:17.576
Not Mike.

445
00:26:18.868 --> 00:26:19.868
You.

446
00:26:59.534 --> 00:27:00.534

from <i>The Hawkins Post.</i>

00:28:06.226 --> 00:28:07.226
Yeah. um...

461
00:28:08.687 --> 00:28:11.022
I have a bit of a weird question for you.

462
00:28:11.898 --> 00:28:14.943
I was wondering if you guys
had gotten any recent calls about. um...

463
00:28:15.944 --> 00:28:17.112
rabid rats?

464
00:28:18.488 --> 00:28:20.448
No. uh. <i>rabid</i> rats.

465
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:22.325
Rats with rabies?

466
00:28:24.786 --> 00:28:25.787
Okay. um...

467
00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:28.248
What about just rats. in general?

468
00:28:30.792 --> 00:28:31.876
Uh-huh.

469
00:28:33.128 --> 00:28:34.796
Okay. Thank you.

470
00:28:36.339 --> 00:28:38.550
You're a regular little detective.
aren't ya?

471
00:28:39.801 --> 00:28:41.428
Lemonade? It's fresh-squeezed.

472
00:28:42.345 --> 00:28:43.847
Sure. thanks.

473
00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:45.431
Um...

474
00:28:45.932 --> 00:28:48.059
Do you mind if I make
just a few more calls?

475
00:28:48.143 --> 00:28:50.353
Not at all. I enjoy the company.

476
00:29:23.303 --> 00:29:24.804
You all right. little bud?

477
00:29:27.182 --> 00:29:28.183
Jonathan!

478
00:29:29.017 --> 00:29:29.934
I have a lead.

479
00:29:30.018 --> 00:29:30.894
Uh...

480
00:29:30.977 --> 00:29:32.187
Yeah. okay. but. uh...

481
00:29:32.687 --> 00:29:35.231
I just think there's something
really wrong with this rat.

482
00:29:35.315 --> 00:29:36.483
Yeah. no shit.

483
00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:38.568
- Come on.
- No. I...

484
00:29:44.574 --> 00:29:45.742
Nancy. wait up.

485
00:30:33.915 --> 00:30:36.292
I said. what do you want?!

486
00:30:39.629 --> 00:30:40.880

487
00:30:41.756 --> 00:30:43.716
I want you to build.

488
00:30:44.634 --> 00:30:46.052
To build what?

489
00:30:46.636 --> 00:30:47.971
What you see.

490
00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:50.014
I don't understand.

491
00:30:55.395 --> 00:30:56.980
I don't understand!

492
00:30:59.065 --> 00:31:01.067
What do you mean? I don't understand!

493
00:31:21.796 --> 00:31:23.298

What?

499
00:32:18.311 --> 00:32:19.771
I said. are you hurt?

500
00:32:20.355 --> 00:32:22.065
What's going on? I heard screaming.

501
00:32:22.148 --> 00:32:23.691
Should I call an ambulance?

502
00:32:26.319 --> 00:32:27.319
Billy?

503
00:32:49.384 --> 00:32:51.344

See? What'd I tell you?

538
00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:53.633
There's more to life than stupid boys.

539
00:34:55.676 --> 00:34:57.303
Can we please play D&D now?

540
00:34:57.386 --> 00:34:58.429
- No.
- No.

541
00:35:04.477 --> 00:35:06.187
Wait. that last part. just one more time.

542
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:07.313
Okay.

543
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:12.819
Okay. that word. Um...

544
00:35:13.402 --> 00:35:15.154
It's pronounced... "dly-nna-ya."

545
00:35:15.238 --> 00:35:17.615
- "Dly-nna-ya..."
<i>- </i>Which is spelled...

546
00:35:17.698 --> 00:35:20.159
D... D. D. D...

The... The chair. The chair-looking thingy.

548
00:35:22.245 --> 00:35:23.496
Yeah. okay.

549
00:35:27.542 --> 00:35:29.752
- We've got our first sentence.
- Oh. seriously?

550
00:35:29.836 --> 00:35:32.338
- Yeah.
- "The week is long."

551
00:35:33.047 --> 00:35:34.090
Well. that's thrilling.

552
00:35:34.173 --> 00:35:35.508
I know. But. progress.

553
00:35:36.884 --> 00:35:40.388
Okay. here you go. you got a strawberry
and then a vanilla with sprinkles.

554
00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:42.390
- extra whipped cream.
- Thanks.

555
00:35:43.057 --> 00:35:44.057
Wait a second.

556
00:35:44.725 --> 00:35:46.018
Are you even allowed to be here?

557
00:35:51.023 --> 00:35:52.023
That...

558
00:35:53.317 --> 00:35:54.317
Okay.

559
00:35:57.196 --> 00:35:58.196
You wanna trade?

560
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.617
That's ridiculous.
Why can't I just...

561
00:36:01.784 --> 00:36:03.953
Oh. you've gotta be shitting me.

562
00:36:04.036 --> 00:36:06.436
- Haven't got that much.
- Okay. what if we split it?

563
00:36:06.497 --> 00:36:08.297
Split it with what?
Does that even make sense?

564
00:36:08.374 --> 00:36:10.251
Isn't this a nice surprise.

565
00:36:13.045 --> 00:36:14.839
What are you doing here?

566
00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:16.590
Shopping.

567
00:36:16.883 --> 00:36:17.967
This is her new style.

568
00:36:18.718 --> 00:36:20.595
- What do you think?
- What's wrong with you?

569
00:36:20.678 --> 00:36:22.198
You know she's not allowed to be here.

570
00:36:22.263 --> 00:36:23.472
What is she. your little pet?

571
00:36:23.556 --> 00:36:24.556
Yeah.

572
00:36:25.099 --> 00:36:26.976
- Am I your pet?
- What? No!

573
00:36:27.059 --> 00:36:29.437
- Then why do you treat me like garbage?
- What?

574
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.522
- You said Nana was sick.
- She is.

575
00:36:31.606 --> 00:36:33.399
She is. She is sick.

576
00:36:33.482 --> 00:36:35.082
- Yeah. sick... she's sick.
- She's sick.

577
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:37.904
She's super sick.
That's why we're here. actually.

578
00:36:37.987 --> 00:36:39.197
Yeah. we're shopping.

579
00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.032
Not for us. but for her. for Nana.

580
00:36:41.115 --> 00:36:44.493
- For Nana.
- Also. we're here to get a gift for you.

581
00:36:44.577 --> 00:36:46.495
Just. we couldn't find anything
that suited you

582
00:36:46.579 --> 00:36:49.749
and I only have. like. $3.50.
so it's hard.

583
00:36:49.832 --> 00:36:51.209
Super hard.

584
00:36:51.959 --> 00:36:53.127
It's... It's expensive.

585
00:36:54.378 --> 00:36:55.755
You lie.

586
00:36:57.715 --> 00:36:58.799
Why do you lie?

587
00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:15.399

591

He raised my property taxes. Jim.

592
00:37:40.549 --> 00:37:41.717
Forced me off my land.

00:37:41.801 --> 00:37:43.469
You can protest all you want. Henry.

594

the proper channels first.

595
00:37:45.721 --> 00:37:48.057
Nothing proper about
what that man did to us!

596
00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.768
- To our town!
- Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

598
00:37:54.897 --> 00:37:56.857
Ooh. yeah.

599
00:37:58.901 --> 00:38:00.361
That the right one?

600
00:38:00.444 --> 00:38:02.154
Yeah.

601
00:38:02.488 --> 00:38:03.823
Yeah!

602
00:38:04.657 --> 00:38:06.575
That's a lot of color for you. Chief.

603
00:38:06.659 --> 00:38:08.619
It's cutting-edge stuff. all right?

604
00:38:10.579 --> 00:38:12.379
It's cutting-edge!

605
00:38:31.475 --> 00:38:34.478
I'll start off with a Scotch.
you can make that a double.

606
00:38:34.562 --> 00:38:35.813
Very good. sir.

607
00:38:35.896 --> 00:38:38.899
And I think we'll have a bottle of red.
as well.

608
00:38:38.983 --> 00:38:40.443
Very good. sir.

609
00:38:40.526 --> 00:38:41.944
And how's your "chee-anti"?

610
00:38:42.653 --> 00:38:45.364
- Our <i>Chianti </i>is quite good.
- Chianti.

611
00:38:45.448 --> 00:38:48.451
Medium-bodied. with just a hint of cherry.

612
00:38:48.534 --> 00:38:49.534
Great.

613
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:50.911
Women love cherries. huh?

614
00:38:51.412 --> 00:38:54.498
All right. we'll have that
and two... two glasses. please.

615
00:38:54.582 --> 00:38:57.668
one for. uh. me and one for the lady.

616
00:38:57.752 --> 00:38:59.462
Ooh. Very good. sir.

617
00:39:25.946 --> 00:39:27.573
And what is this again?

618
00:39:28.157 --> 00:39:30.910
This is a solenoid.

619
00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:34.580
It's a coil.
wrapped around a metallic core.

620
00:39:34.663 --> 00:39:36.582
and when electricity passes through it...

621
00:39:36.665 --> 00:39:39.126
It creates an electromagnetic field.

622
00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:40.294
Exactamundo.

623
00:39:40.544 --> 00:39:41.837
Now for the fun part.

624
00:39:41.921 --> 00:39:43.214
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

625
00:39:48.844 --> 00:39:50.388
I... I don't see anything.

626
00:39:50.471 --> 00:39:51.389
Nope.

627
00:39:51.472 --> 00:39:54.058
You can't see it. but it's there.
I assure you.

628
00:39:54.141 --> 00:39:57.853
Our very own Clarke-Byers
Electromagnetic Field.

629
00:39:57.937 --> 00:39:59.146
Pretty neato. huh?

630
00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.481
Yeah.

631
00:40:00.564 --> 00:40:03.692
And this field affects any charged object
in its vicinity.

632
00:40:03.776 --> 00:40:05.736
- Just like my magnets.
- Just like your magnets.

633
00:40:06.487 --> 00:40:08.406
Okay. why is nothing happening?

634
00:40:08.489 --> 00:40:10.324
Oh. because our field is stable.

635
00:40:10.783 --> 00:40:12.493
But. if we reduce the current...

636
00:40:14.662 --> 00:40:15.996
How...

637
00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.874
The magnetic dipoles tried to orient
according to the field. but...

638
00:40:18.958 --> 00:40:21.752
No. no. no. I mean.
how is this happening at my house?

639
00:40:21.836 --> 00:40:23.003
You want my honest opinion?

640
00:40:23.587 --> 00:40:25.714
One of your kiddos got up
in the middle of the night.

641
00:40:25.798 --> 00:40:27.925
bumped into the fridge.
and knocked the suckers loose.

642
00:40:28.008 --> 00:40:29.760
And the magnets at Melvald's?

643
00:40:29.844 --> 00:40:32.096
- Apophenia.
- Apo-what-o-whah?

644
00:40:32.179 --> 00:40:33.848
Apophenia. Uh...

645
00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:36.260
You're seeing patterns that aren't there.
Coincidence.

646
00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:38.185
But what if...

647
00:40:38.727 --> 00:40:39.895
it's not?

648
00:40:40.563 --> 00:40:41.563
Well...

649
00:40:44.275 --> 00:40:45.776
Theoretically-speaking.

650
00:40:46.527 --> 00:40:51.532
I suppose some large version
of this AC transformer could exist.

651
00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:53.534
A machine of some kind.

652
00:40:53.617 --> 00:40:54.535
A machine?

653
00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:58.330
But. in order to reach your house
and downtown. gosh.

654
00:40:58.414 --> 00:41:00.294
that would take
billions of volts of electricity

655
00:41:00.332 --> 00:41:02.626
and cost tens of millions of dollars.

656
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:04.670
But it is possible.

657
00:41:05.671 --> 00:41:07.256
We cured polio in '53.

658
00:41:08.048 --> 00:41:09.884
Landed on the moon in '69.

659
00:41:10.217 --> 00:41:11.802
As I tell my students.

660
00:41:11.886 --> 00:41:14.180
once you open up that curiosity door.

661
00:41:14.847 --> 00:41:16.223
anything is possible.

662
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:28.027
"The week is long.

663
00:41:28.777 --> 00:41:31.489
the silver cat feeds.

664
00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:35.993
when blue meets yellow in the west."

665
00:41:36.076 --> 00:41:37.786
I mean. it just...

666
00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:39.538
it just can't be right.

667
00:41:39.622 --> 00:41:41.892
- It's right.
- Honestly. I think it's great news.

668
00:41:41.916 --> 00:41:43.125
How is this great news?

669
00:41:43.209 --> 00:41:45.503
I mean.
so much for being American heroes.

670
00:41:45.586 --> 00:41:47.379
- It's total nonsense.
- It's not nonsense.

671
00:41:47.463 --> 00:41:49.423
It's too specific. It's obviously a code.

672
00:41:49.507 --> 00:41:51.818
- What do you mean. a code?
- Like a super secret spy code.

673
00:41:51.842 --> 00:41:54.261
- That's a total stretch.
- I don't know. is it?

674
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:55.763
You're buying into this?

675
00:41:55.846 --> 00:41:57.014
Listen. just for kicks.

676
00:41:57.097 --> 00:42:00.267
let's entertain the possibility
that it is a secret Russian transmission.

677
00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:02.911
What'd you think they were gonna say.
"Fire the warhead at noon"?

678
00:42:02.937 --> 00:42:04.939
- Exactly.
- And my translation is correct.

679
00:42:05.022 --> 00:42:06.815
I know that for sure. so...

680
00:42:06.899 --> 00:42:09.109
"The silver cat feeds."
<i>W</i> hy would anyone talk like that

681
00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:10.353
unless they're trying to mask

682
00:42:10.402 --> 00:42:11.963
- the meaning of their message?
- Exactly.

683
00:42:11.987 --> 00:42:14.198
Why would anyone mask
the true meaning of their message

684
00:42:14.281 --> 00:42:16.283
unless the message was somehow sensitive?

685
00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:17.576
Exactly.

686
00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.829
- So I guess that confirms your suspicion.
- Evil Russians.

687
00:42:20.913 --> 00:42:24.166
I can't believe I'm about to agree
with this strange child. but.

688
00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:25.668
yeah. totally evil Russians.

689
00:42:25.751 --> 00:42:26.751
So how do we crack it?

690
00:42:26.794 --> 00:42:30.798
Well. I guess we translate the rest
and hopefully a pattern emerges.

691
00:42:30.881 --> 00:42:33.509
A pattern. Right. like maybe "silver cat"
is a meeting place?

692
00:42:33.592 --> 00:42:34.635
Or a person.

693
00:42:34.718 --> 00:42:35.636
Or a weapon.

694
00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:38.138
It's probably gonna take a super genius
to crack it. but...

695
00:42:38.597 --> 00:42:39.597
Where's Steve?

696
00:42:41.517 --> 00:42:43.037
Hey. Steve.

697
00:42:43.102 --> 00:42:44.144
What are you doing?

698
00:42:44.228 --> 00:42:46.647
Uh. it's a quarter. I need...
Do you have a quarter?

699
00:42:47.856 --> 00:42:50.150
- Sure you're tall enough for that ride?
- Quarter!

700
00:42:54.321 --> 00:42:55.990
You need help getting up. little Stevie?

701
00:42:56.073 --> 00:42:57.116
Shh!

702
00:42:57.199 --> 00:42:58.909
Would you two just shut up and listen?

703
00:43:03.998 --> 00:43:04.998
Holy shit.

704
00:43:07.001 --> 00:43:08.001
The music.

705
00:43:09.587 --> 00:43:10.713
The music!

706
00:43:16.594 --> 00:43:18.012
I don't understand.

707
00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:19.972
It's the exact same song
on the recording.

708
00:43:20.055 --> 00:43:22.558
Maybe they have horses like this
in Russia.

709
00:43:22.641 --> 00:43:24.393
"Indiana Flyer"? I don't...

710
00:43:25.102 --> 00:43:26.145
I don't think so.

711
00:43:26.937 --> 00:43:29.398
This code. it... didn't come from Russia.

712
00:43:31.317 --> 00:43:32.443
It came from here.

713
00:44:00.679 --> 00:44:03.182
Would you like to order your entrée. sir?

714
00:44:03.265 --> 00:44:05.309
You know what. Enzo?

715
00:44:05.392 --> 00:44:07.353
My name is not Enzo.

716
00:44:07.895 --> 00:44:09.980
I just lost my appetite. all right?

717
00:44:10.064 --> 00:44:11.315
So. here you go.

718
00:44:11.899 --> 00:44:12.941
You can keep the change.

719
00:44:13.025 --> 00:44:14.485
Sir!

720
00:44:14.568 --> 00:44:17.404
I'm afraid no alcohol is allowed
off the premises.

721
00:44:19.615 --> 00:44:20.991
I can do anything I want.

722
00:44:21.408 --> 00:44:22.951
I'm the chief of police.

723
00:45:12.751 --> 00:45:14.128
<i>Billy. are you okay?</i>

724
00:46:15.272 --> 00:46:16.774
Don't be afraid.

725
00:46:17.441 --> 00:46:18.901
It'll be over soon.

726
00:46:19.985 --> 00:46:21.612
Just stay very still.

727
00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:47.220
No!

9999
00:00:0.500 --> 00:00:2.00
