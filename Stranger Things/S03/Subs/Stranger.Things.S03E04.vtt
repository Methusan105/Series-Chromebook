00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:25.984
<i>I'm sorry.
I did not quite catch your name.</i>

2
00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:29.862
<i>What happened?</i>

3
00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:31.572
Help me.

4
00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:33.575
No!

5
00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:38.204
Which one?

6
00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:39.955
I don't know.

7
00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:47.088
Hey. there's nothing to worry about
anymore. okay?

8
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.051
It doesn't make sense.

9
00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:52.969
What doesn't make sense?

10
00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:55.512
Heather.

11
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.433
The blood.

12
00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:00.310
The ice.

13
00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:04.355
Heather had a fever. so she took
a cold bath. but she's better now.

14
00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:06.357
That has to be it.

15
00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:08.318
I don't know where that blood
came from. but...

16
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.986
we saw her.

17
00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.947
We both saw her. She's totally fine.

18
00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.075
What about Billy?

19
00:01:17.368 --> 00:01:18.368
What about him?

20
00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.915
He seemed wrong.

21
00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:24.542
Wrong is kind of like
his default.

22
00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:28.296
But it's nice to know he's not a murderer.
because that would've totally sucked.

23
00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:36.763
Who... is that?

24
00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:41.142
See. this is why you can't just
hang out with Mike all the time.

25
00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:42.477
This is Wonder Woman.

26
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.145
AKA Princess Diana.

27
00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.482
She's from Paradise Island.
which is. like. this hidden island

28
00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:49.651
where there are only
women Amazon warriors.

29
00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:57.033
Let me go! Let me go!

30
00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:59.410
Doris. we need you to stay calm for us.
okay?

31
00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.287
- Stay calm.
- I have to go back!

32
00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:04.165
I have to go back!

33
00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:06.459
I have to go back!

34
00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:08.586
I have to go back!

35
00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:11.923
Okay. so.

36
00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:15.552
you two want to explain to me
what in the name of Jesus

37
00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:16.886
just happened here?

38
00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:46.373
Tom!

39
00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:56.926
Hi. Daddy.

40
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.390
Heather...

41
00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:05.851
sweetie...

42
00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:09.397
whatever this is.
whatever he's got you into.

43
00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:11.357
you don't have to do this.

44
00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:15.069
You can stop this.

45
00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:17.739
There is no stopping it. Daddy.

46
00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:20.658
You'll see.

47
00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:23.744
No.

48
00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.006
Heather. please! Heather!

49
00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.218
Try not to move.

50
00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:42.513
No.

51
00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:43.597
No.

52
00:03:45.683 --> 00:03:47.143
Heather!

53
00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.227
Heather!

54
00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:56.361
Jesus Christ.

55
00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:06.203
No.

56
00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:09.289
No...

57
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.255
Hey. careful.

58
00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.382
Careful.

59
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.092
Here.

60
00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:45.594
Hey.

61
00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:47.971
Joyce.

62
00:05:52.643 --> 00:05:53.644
Oh.

63
00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:56.564
Here. here. here.

64
00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:58.941
It's okay.

65
00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:02.570
That's it. Got it?

66
00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:08.201
- Here.
- How long have I been out?

67
00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:09.202
A while.

68
00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:11.245
You've been drifting in and out.

69
00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:13.247
Yeah. but how did I get here?

70
00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:14.331
Slowly.

71
00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:17.960
- What's the last thing you remember?
- Some thug attacked me.

72
00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:20.046
- Hey. you need to rest.
- No. I'm fine.

73
00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:22.131
- No. you're not fine. Hop...
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

74
00:06:23.424 --> 00:06:24.550
Um...

75
00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:26.219
- Where are my clothes?
- Uh...

76
00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:27.970
Uh...

77
00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:37.647
They were soaked.

78
00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:41.692
I mean. did you recognize him?

79
00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:43.152
- Who?
- The thug.

80
00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:45.169
Well. I didn't get a good look.

81
00:06:45.446 --> 00:06:48.157
Well. I mean.
he's gotta be government. right?

82
00:06:48.616 --> 00:06:51.911
Yeah. but if he's government.
what's he doing slinking around?

83
00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:53.621
W-Why is he running?

84
00:06:53.704 --> 00:06:55.624
You know.
why didn't we find anything down there?

85
00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:56.791
Let's ask him.

86
00:06:58.376 --> 00:06:59.377
What is that?

87
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.878
His license plate.

88
00:07:01.462 --> 00:07:03.798
- What are the dashes?
- Well. they're blanks.

89
00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:06.426
There was...
I think it was either an H or a P

90
00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:08.052
with the part rubbed off.

91
00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:10.138
And there was definitely a Y.

92
00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:11.389
For sure.

93
00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:14.600
And that. I think. was a B.
but it could've been an eight.

94
00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:15.726
And that... Wait...

95
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.562
I think you should stick to sales.

96
00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:20.898
Can't you run a search or something?

97
00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:24.318
I just think you have to lower
your expectations.

98
00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:26.988
I mean. this is a state government agency.

99
00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:28.739
Gonna take weeks
before they find a match.

100
00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:30.741
- Weeks?
- If we're lucky.

101
00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:31.659
And. I mean.

102
00:07:31.742 --> 00:07:33.953
what are the odds that this guy

103
00:07:34.036 --> 00:07:36.289
registers a car in his own name?

104
00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:37.665
It wasn't a car.

105
00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:40.501
Uh. what are you wearing?

106
00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:42.670
What do you mean it wasn't a car?

107
00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:46.215
<i>Do you copy?</i>

108
00:07:46.757 --> 00:07:48.676
<i>This is a code red.</i>

109
00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:52.805
<i>I repeat. this is a code red.</i>

110
00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:55.892
<i>Max. Do you copy?</i>

111
00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:58.603
<i>This is a code red.</i>

112
00:07:58.686 --> 00:07:59.562
Shut...

113
00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:00.645
up.

114
00:08:06.444 --> 00:08:07.695
She turned it off.

115
00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:14.243
You've got to be kidding me.

116
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.873
I'm sleeping. Go away.

117
00:08:18.956 --> 00:08:20.791
<i>This is Mike. Do not hang up.</i>

118
00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:22.627
Something happened. something bad.

119
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.837
<i>Our very lives can be at stake.</i>

120
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:27.241
- What are you talking about?
<i>- Just come over to my house.</i>

121
00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:28.633
We'll explain everything.

122
00:08:28.716 --> 00:08:29.842
- <i>What?</i>
- Hurry.

123
00:08:33.137 --> 00:08:34.347
What did he say?

124
00:08:36.098 --> 00:08:37.183
Try Dustin again.

125
00:08:37.266 --> 00:08:38.184
He's not answering.

126
00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:40.061
So. try him again.

127
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.189
Dustin. do you copy?

128
00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:46.859
I repeat. this is a code red.

129
00:08:57.995 --> 00:09:00.414
<i>That keycard opens the door.
but unfortunately.</i>

130
00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:03.459
<i>the Russian with this keycard
also has a massive gun.</i>

131
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.545
Whatever's in this room.
whatever's in those boxes.

132
00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.338
they really don't want anybody finding it.

133
00:09:07.421 --> 00:09:08.839
But there's gotta be a way in.

134
00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:10.925
Well. you know...

135
00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:14.262
I could just take him out.

136
00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:16.472
- Take who out?
- The Russian guard.

137
00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:18.474
What? I sneak up behind him.

138
00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:20.601
I knock him out. and I take his keycard.
It's easy.

139
00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:22.895
Did you not hear the part
about the massive gun?

140
00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:24.397
Yes. Dustin. I did.

141
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.316
And that's why I would be sneaking.

142
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.234
Ah.

143
00:09:28.317 --> 00:09:30.111
Well. please. tell me this.
and be honest.

144
00:09:30.194 --> 00:09:32.572
have you ever actually... won a fight?

145
00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:33.948
Okay. that was one time...

146
00:09:34.031 --> 00:09:35.533
Twice. Jonathan. Year prior?

147
00:09:35.616 --> 00:09:36.826
Listen. that doesn't count.

148
00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:39.549
Why wouldn't it? Because it looks
like he beat the shit out of you.

149
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.420
- It was...
- You got a fat lip. crooked nose.

150
00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:44.017
- swollen eye. a lot of blood...
- ...things that all added up...

151
00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:45.376
That just might work.

152
00:09:47.795 --> 00:09:48.795
Robin.

153
00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:50.965
Hey. Robin!
Hey. what... what are you doing?

154
00:09:51.048 --> 00:09:52.728
- I need cash.
- Well. half of that's mine.

155
00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:54.778
- Where're you going?
- To find a way into that room.

156
00:09:54.802 --> 00:09:55.802
a safe way.

157
00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:57.763
And. in the meantime.
sling ice cream.

158
00:09:57.847 --> 00:10:00.141
behave. and don't get beat up.

159
00:10:00.224 --> 00:10:01.517
I'll be back in a jiff.

160
00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:04.937
Oh. dude.

161
00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:07.440
Come on. man. not my scooper.

162
00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:18.706
If he gets us
the layout by noon. we can.

163
00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:20.036
Okay. I'll let him know.

164
00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:28.673
Dunno if they'll go through with it.
but I just thought you should know.

165
00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:36.801
Nancy.

166
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.222
Jonathan.

167
00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:43.893
<i>I've worked at this paper
for twenty-five years.</i>

168
00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:45.728
Twenty-five...

169
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.563
years.

170
00:10:48.564 --> 00:10:49.764
Now. we're a small-town paper.

171
00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:51.695
but we have something
the big papers don't have:

172
00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:53.193
trust.

173
00:10:54.028 --> 00:10:56.197
- The trust of our community.
- Tom. if you just...

174
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.408
Do you know how I built that trust?
By placing my faith in something

175
00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.619
the two of you don't seem to value
a whole lot:

176
00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:03.995
facts.

177
00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:06.456
Facts.

178
00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:09.377
So. while we're here.
let's go over the facts.

179
00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:13.798
Fact one: you disobeyed a direct order
to stop pursuing this story.

180
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:17.051
Two: you falsely identified yourselves
as reporters.

181
00:11:17.134 --> 00:11:19.470
repeatedly lying to an elderly woman.

182
00:11:19.553 --> 00:11:23.432
Three: you broke into her home.
committing trespass.

183
00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:25.476
Four: she almost died en route
to the hospital.

184
00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:27.478
She would've died if we hadn't shown up!

185
00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:30.064
Whatever disease that rat had
clearly passed to her...

186
00:11:30.147 --> 00:11:33.526
Five!
Mrs. Driscoll is a paranoid schizophrenic.

187
00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:37.228
You didn't know that. did you?

188
00:11:38.322 --> 00:11:39.322
Now...

189
00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:41.492
disease-carrying rats?

190
00:11:41.575 --> 00:11:44.578
The second coming of the plague?
Does this sound credible to you.

191
00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:47.599
or perhaps does this sound more like
the delusions of a very sick old lady?

192
00:11:47.623 --> 00:11:50.334
- I didn't know that.
- Her family's furious.

193
00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.420
So furious. in fact.
they've threatened litigation.

194
00:11:52.503 --> 00:11:54.672
- Litigation?
- That's crazy.

195
00:11:54.755 --> 00:11:56.006
For once. we agree.

196
00:11:56.465 --> 00:11:57.717
This is crazy.

197
00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.480
In fact. in my entire professional career.

198
00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.387
I've never dealt with anything
quite like it.

199
00:12:02.638 --> 00:12:03.638
But hopefully.

200
00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:06.726
hopefully. you've learned
something valuable here.

201
00:12:08.018 --> 00:12:09.019
You've learned...

202
00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:11.021
how in the workplace.

203
00:12:11.522 --> 00:12:12.732
in the real world.

204
00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:15.025
there are consequences to your actions.

205
00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:17.236
Which brings me to my sixth and final...

206
00:12:18.362 --> 00:12:19.362
fact.

207
00:12:20.322 --> 00:12:21.322
You're fired.

208
00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:24.493
Both of you.

209
00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:33.169
<i>I didn't think it was anything
at first.</i>

210
00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:36.380
I mean. I think I just didn't want
to believe it.

211
00:12:38.215 --> 00:12:40.718
The first time I felt it
was at <i>Day of the Dead.</i>

212
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.598
- Power went out that night. too.
- And then I felt it again

213
00:12:45.681 --> 00:12:47.600
at the field near the Nelson farm
the next day.

214
00:12:49.143 --> 00:12:51.729
Then again yesterday outside Castle Byers.

215
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.106
Will!

216
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.566
What does it feel like?

217
00:12:56.358 --> 00:12:57.401
It's almost like...

218
00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.279
You know when you drop
on a roller coaster?

219
00:13:00.362 --> 00:13:01.405
- Sure.
- Yeah.

220
00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:03.491
- No.
- It's like...

221
00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:05.826
everything inside your body

222
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.412
is just sinking all at once. but...

223
00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:10.414
this is worse.

224
00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:11.498
Your body...

225
00:13:11.957 --> 00:13:14.668
it goes cold and... and you can't breathe.

226
00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:17.755
I've felt it before.

227
00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:19.882
whenever he was close.

228
00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:23.928
Whenever who was close?

229
00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:25.595
The Mind Flayer.

230
00:13:26.722 --> 00:13:28.140
Go away!

231
00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:30.476
Go away!

232
00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:32.812
I closed the gate.

233
00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:34.146
I know. but...

234
00:13:35.606 --> 00:13:36.857
what if he never left?

235
00:13:39.693 --> 00:13:41.612
What if we locked him out here with us?

236
00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:46.784
This is him.

237
00:13:46.867 --> 00:13:47.701
All of him.

238
00:13:47.785 --> 00:13:49.495
But. that day on the field.

239
00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:52.164
a part of him attached itself to me.

240
00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:56.961
My mom got it out of me...

241
00:13:57.044 --> 00:13:59.588
Get the hell out of my son!

242
00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:02.258
...and Eleven closed the gate.

243
00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:09.640
But the part that was still in me.
what if it's still in our world?

244
00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:15.771
In Hawkins.

245
00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:19.191
I don't understand.
The Demodogs died when El closed the gate.

246
00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:21.068
If the brain dies. the body dies.

247
00:14:21.151 --> 00:14:22.486
We can't take any chances.

248
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.821
We need to assume the worst.

249
00:14:23.904 --> 00:14:25.447
The Mind Flayer's back.

250
00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:28.242
Yeah. And if he is.

251
00:14:28.325 --> 00:14:30.452
he'd want to attach himself
to someone again.

252
00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:31.579
A new me.

253
00:14:31.662 --> 00:14:32.705
A new host.

254
00:14:34.456 --> 00:14:36.375
How can you tell if someone is a host?

255
00:14:52.808 --> 00:14:53.934
Hey. is he in?

256
00:14:54.018 --> 00:14:55.858
- Yes. he's busy at the moment. but...
- Great.

257
00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:57.187
Excuse me.

258
00:14:57.396 --> 00:14:58.564
You should sit down.

259
00:14:59.189 --> 00:15:00.232
...wouldn't listen...

260
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.400
Uh...

261
00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:03.652
Tony. hold on.

262
00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:05.905
Let me. uh...

263
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.657
I might have to...
Let me call you back. Okay.

264
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:09.950
Thanks.

265
00:15:11.035 --> 00:15:12.286
- Jim.
- I know. I know.

266
00:15:12.369 --> 00:15:14.455
You're busy.
I'm gonna make this fast. I promise.

267
00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:16.165
Is there...

268
00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:17.833
some kind of problem?

269
00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.960
Yeah. You might say that.

270
00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:22.254
Um. I'm looking for the name of a guy.

271
00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:23.672
The name of a guy.

272
00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:25.382
Yeah. I think you might know this guy.

273
00:15:25.466 --> 00:15:27.176
- Okay.
- He was here the other day.

274
00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:28.427
Rides a motorcycle.

275
00:15:31.847 --> 00:15:33.682
Big build. square jaw. dark hair.

276
00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:35.935
He's probably military. maybe ex-military?

277
00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:39.271
Is this ringing... any bells?

278
00:15:39.355 --> 00:15:41.023
Uh...

279
00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:42.316
I don't think so.

280
00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:43.484
Really?

281
00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:45.486
'Cause it was just two days ago.

282
00:15:45.569 --> 00:15:46.849
This was right before I saw you.

283
00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:47.904
Oh!

284
00:15:47.988 --> 00:15:49.198
- You know what?
- What?

285
00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:50.616
Could be the maintenance guy.

286
00:15:50.699 --> 00:15:52.701
- Maintenance.
- Yeah. I can't remember his name.

287
00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:54.328
Oh. God... Uh...

288
00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:56.330
Gary or John or something.

289
00:15:56.413 --> 00:15:58.165
Candice will have his name on file.

290
00:15:59.416 --> 00:16:02.044
We've had trouble with the plumbing.
Clogged toilets and...

291
00:16:02.503 --> 00:16:05.297
sinks with minds of their own.

292
00:16:05.756 --> 00:16:08.092
You meeting with a lot of plumbers. Larry?

293
00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:10.135
Excuse me?

294
00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:13.847
This guy. when I saw him.
he was coming out of your office.

295
00:16:15.057 --> 00:16:17.393
Okay. well. I don't remember that.

296
00:16:18.185 --> 00:16:19.895
I shake a lot of hands. you know?

297
00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:27.361
Do you remember when I caught you
passed out in the hideaway

298
00:16:27.444 --> 00:16:29.113
with all that powder all over your nose?

299
00:16:29.196 --> 00:16:31.198
- You remember?
- Jim. come on. now.

300
00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:34.952
Do you remember when my boys
found you and Candice going at it

301
00:16:35.035 --> 00:16:37.246
like a couple of bunnies
in the back of your Cadillac?

302
00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:39.540
Do you remember that?

303
00:16:39.623 --> 00:16:42.543
Does your wife remember that?

304
00:16:42.626 --> 00:16:43.919
You. uh...

305
00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:45.283
You really wanna play this game?

306
00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:46.337
Huh?

307
00:16:46.463 --> 00:16:47.923
Not a game. Lar.

308
00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:49.133
Okay.

309
00:16:49.216 --> 00:16:51.593
Those pills you used to swallow
like candy.

310
00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:54.388
I can't recall.
did you have a prescription for those?

311
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:56.473
Or how about drinking on duty?

312
00:16:58.434 --> 00:16:59.434
Yeah.

313
00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:02.938
We have some real fun stories about that.

314
00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:08.444
One call to Tom at the <i>Post...</i>

315
00:17:09.611 --> 00:17:10.654
and you're done. buddy.

316
00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:12.697
You're gone.

317
00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:14.616
Oh. and. please.

318
00:17:15.325 --> 00:17:18.245
don't give me that dead daughter
sob story.

319
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:20.372
'cause I just don't care.

320
00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:22.332
Now. if you don't mind.

321
00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:24.168
I really am rather busy.

322
00:17:24.251 --> 00:17:25.753
Operating directors...

323
00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:28.047
Damn it!

324
00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:31.967
My nose! You broke my goddamn nose!

325
00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:33.802
And your friend almost killed me
last night.

326
00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:35.596
so I'd say we're still not even.

327
00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:36.722
Larry?

328
00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:38.766
- Let's cut the crap. Larry!
- Larry!

329
00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:41.536
- Who is this guy? Government? Military?
- You're making a big mistake.

330
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.560
Who is he?

331
00:17:42.603 --> 00:17:44.146
It's Arnold Schwarzenegger.

332
00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:46.190
Larry!

333
00:17:47.816 --> 00:17:49.610
Who you calling? The police?

334
00:17:53.864 --> 00:17:57.076
That is a nice ring you got there. Larry.

335
00:17:57.159 --> 00:17:58.577
Are you insane?

336
00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:59.660
I don't know.

337
00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:00.996
Let's find out.

338
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.874
Okay. okay. okay.
Be cool. be cool.

339
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.503
I don't know his name. I swear.

340
00:18:07.586 --> 00:18:10.464
Ah. ah. ah!

341
00:18:10.547 --> 00:18:11.882
But you know him.

342
00:18:12.424 --> 00:18:15.094
He... He gives me things sometimes.

343
00:18:15.177 --> 00:18:16.261
What kind of things?

344
00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:18.889
Money. Presents. Aah! Gifts.

345
00:18:18.972 --> 00:18:20.224
Who is this guy. Santa Claus?

346
00:18:20.307 --> 00:18:22.351
Starcourt. Starcourt.
He works for Starcourt.

347
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.728
- The mall?
- Yes. yes.

348
00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:25.979
Yeah. right.

349
00:18:26.063 --> 00:18:28.982
Aah! I swear! I swear! I swear! Starcourt.

350
00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:30.106
They... They own the mall.

351
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:33.612
They want to expand to East Hawkins.
They needed property. some land.

352
00:18:33.695 --> 00:18:37.366
Some people didn't want to sell.
so I leaned on them a little. That's all.

353
00:18:37.449 --> 00:18:39.451
I swear. that's all.

354
00:18:44.331 --> 00:18:46.959
- Why do they want this land?
- I don't know!

355
00:18:47.042 --> 00:18:48.962
You have records of these purchases.
these. uh...

356
00:18:49.545 --> 00:18:50.921
these land purchases?

357
00:18:54.716 --> 00:18:56.516
You don't want to mess with these people.
Jim.

358
00:18:57.052 --> 00:18:59.888
I think you should worry about yourself
right now. Larry. not about me.

359
00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:02.349
The records.

360
00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:03.976
Where are they?

361
00:19:04.059 --> 00:19:06.019
Larry?

362
00:19:06.103 --> 00:19:07.437
He just bumped his head.

363
00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:09.773
Just a little boo-boo. right. Lar?

364
00:19:10.524 --> 00:19:11.733
Have a nice day.

365
00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:13.151
Larry!

366
00:19:14.736 --> 00:19:15.904
It's bullshit.

367
00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:19.408
So. according to Tom.
Driscoll's just a schizophrenic?

368
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.618
And that rat is just a rat?

369
00:19:21.702 --> 00:19:23.829
And it's all. what. some big coincidence?

370
00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:25.413
You know what I think?

371
00:19:25.873 --> 00:19:27.082
I think Tom was on drugs.

372
00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:28.584
- What?
- Did you see him?

373
00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:30.335
He was sweating like crazy.

374
00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:31.503
And his palms were clammy.

375
00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:33.130
He looked awful.

376
00:19:33.213 --> 00:19:35.549
- Oh. is this funny to you?
- No.

377
00:19:35.632 --> 00:19:37.384
No. it's just kind of incredible.

378
00:19:37.467 --> 00:19:38.635
Incredible?

379
00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:41.513
Yeah. incredible how you just continue
to convince yourself.

380
00:19:41.597 --> 00:19:42.848
What's that supposed to mean?

381
00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:45.851
I told you over and over
to drop this story.

382
00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:47.978
That it was a bad idea.

383
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:50.355
But you refused. and now. I'm screwed.

384
00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:52.691
It's a summer job.
Your life is hardly over.

385
00:19:52.774 --> 00:19:54.985
I don't live in a two-story house
on Maple Street.

386
00:19:55.068 --> 00:19:56.570
My dad doesn't earn six figures.

387
00:19:56.653 --> 00:19:58.071
Hell. he isn't even around.

388
00:19:58.155 --> 00:19:59.795
God. here comes the Oliver Twist routine.

389
00:19:59.823 --> 00:20:01.825
Mortgage. college tuition.

390
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:03.869
You know. they're real things. Nancy.

391
00:20:03.952 --> 00:20:06.538
Things that you don't care about.
only because you don't have to.

392
00:20:06.622 --> 00:20:09.208
- I didn't realize I lived in a bubble!
- Well. you do!

393
00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:11.668
You want everything handed to you
on a silver platter.

394
00:20:11.752 --> 00:20:14.129
I mean. we were interns. Nancy!

395
00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:15.631
Interns!

396
00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:19.384
What did you expect. that you would make
star reporter in a month?

397
00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:20.802
Crack the big case?

398
00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:23.347
You sound just like them.
You realize that. right?

399
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.932
Just like Bruce and those assholes...

400
00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:27.100
Yeah. yeah. those assholes gave us jobs.

401
00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:29.978
Is that what that was?
That was humiliating.

402
00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:31.396
Humiliating.

403
00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.023
Yeah. the real world sucks.

404
00:20:33.982 --> 00:20:35.400
Deal with it like the rest of us.

405
00:20:37.402 --> 00:20:39.571
You don't know what it's like.

406
00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:42.616
Neither do you.

407
00:20:44.493 --> 00:20:48.580
Well. then. I guess we just don't
understand each other anymore.

408
00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:51.124
Yeah. I guess not.

409
00:21:01.176 --> 00:21:02.511
Hey. you're home early.

410
00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:04.721
Yeah. Light day.

411
00:21:14.398 --> 00:21:16.483
<i>It is fascinating
what 20 bucks will get you</i>

412
00:21:16.566 --> 00:21:18.110
<i>at the County Recorder's Office.</i>

413
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.696
Starcourt Mall.

414
00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:21.822
The complete blueprints.

415
00:21:21.905 --> 00:21:23.115
Not bad.

416
00:21:23.198 --> 00:21:24.825
So. this is us. Scoops.

417
00:21:24.908 --> 00:21:26.743
and this is where we want to get.

418
00:21:26.827 --> 00:21:28.287
I mean. I don't really see a way in.

419
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:29.288
There's not.

420
00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:33.166
if you're talking exclusively about doors.

421
00:21:34.084 --> 00:21:35.002
Air ducts.

422
00:21:35.085 --> 00:21:36.128
Exactly.

423
00:21:36.211 --> 00:21:40.007
Turns out. this secret room needs air
just like any old room.

424
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:42.718
And these air ducts

425
00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:45.053
lead all the way...

426
00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:49.890
here.

427
00:21:58.525 --> 00:21:59.526
Flashlight.

428
00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:01.653
Thank you.

429
00:22:05.073 --> 00:22:08.118
Yeah. I don't know. man. I don't know
if you can fit in here. It's. like...

430
00:22:08.452 --> 00:22:09.661
super tight.

431
00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:10.745
I'll fit.

432
00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:12.622
Trust me. No collar bones. remember?

433
00:22:12.706 --> 00:22:13.790
Uh. excuse me?

434
00:22:15.625 --> 00:22:17.961
Oh. he's. uh...
Yeah. he's got some disease.

435
00:22:18.045 --> 00:22:20.047
Chry. uh... It's chrydo. um...

436
00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:21.965
Something. Yeah. I dunno.

437
00:22:22.049 --> 00:22:24.110
He's missing bones and stuff.
He can bend like Gumbo.

438
00:22:24.134 --> 00:22:25.677
You mean Gumby.

439
00:22:25.761 --> 00:22:27.304
I'm pretty sure it's Gumbo.

440
00:22:27.387 --> 00:22:29.348
- Steve. just shut up and push me!
- Okay.

441
00:22:31.183 --> 00:22:32.225
I'll push ya.

442
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.645
- Not my feet. dumbass. Push my ass.
- What?

443
00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:37.314
Touch my butt! I don't care!

444
00:22:37.397 --> 00:22:39.691
- Come on! Harder! Push harder!
- I'm pushing!

445
00:22:39.775 --> 00:22:43.403
- You're playing with my legs.
- I'm not playing. I have terrible footing.

446
00:22:43.487 --> 00:22:45.405
- Come on!
- I'm gonna just shove you. ready?

447
00:22:45.489 --> 00:22:47.282
- Just shove me?
- One. two...

448
00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:49.117
- Shit.
- That work?

449
00:22:49.201 --> 00:22:51.870
- One more time.
- Ahoy. sailors! All hands on deck!

450
00:22:51.953 --> 00:22:52.953
Ahoy!

451
00:22:52.996 --> 00:22:54.414
Come on.

452
00:22:54.498 --> 00:22:56.750
Get over here
and serve me some samples.

453
00:22:59.127 --> 00:23:01.630
I don't know.
He looks pretty normal to me.

454
00:23:01.963 --> 00:23:05.425
Normal? How many times
have you seen him with a shirt on?

455
00:23:06.093 --> 00:23:07.677
I mean. it's a little weird.

456
00:23:07.761 --> 00:23:08.762
More than a little.

457
00:23:08.845 --> 00:23:11.723
He was in a tub with ice.
The Mind Flayer likes it cold.

458
00:23:12.307 --> 00:23:15.143
- Plus everything else...
- But he's lounging at the pool.

459
00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:17.437
which is. like.
the least Mind Flayer thing ever.

460
00:23:17.521 --> 00:23:19.022
Not necessarily.

461
00:23:20.315 --> 00:23:22.567
The Mind Flayer likes to hide.

462
00:23:22.818 --> 00:23:24.319
He only used me when he needed me.

463
00:23:25.487 --> 00:23:27.489
It's like... like you're dormant.

464
00:23:28.323 --> 00:23:30.492
And then. when he needs you.

465
00:23:31.785 --> 00:23:32.785
you're activated.

466
00:23:33.578 --> 00:23:34.955
Okay. so we just...

467
00:23:35.038 --> 00:23:36.498
wait until he gets activated.

468
00:23:36.665 --> 00:23:37.999
No. What if he hurts someone?

469
00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:39.084
Or kills someone.

470
00:23:39.167 --> 00:23:40.627
We can't take that chance.

471
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:42.712
We need to find out if he's the host.

472
00:23:44.381 --> 00:23:46.466
- Where are you going?
- I have an idea. Boys only.

473
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:48.468
- Seriously?
- Just trust me on this one.

474
00:23:55.183 --> 00:23:58.270
Okay. so we wait until the pool closes.
until everyone leaves.

475
00:23:58.353 --> 00:24:01.356
and we somehow get him
to come from here and...

476
00:24:03.733 --> 00:24:04.943
get him into here.

477
00:24:07.362 --> 00:24:10.198
- Hey. shut the door!
- Hey. come on. kid. shut it!

478
00:24:12.492 --> 00:24:14.494
I think I just threw up in my mouth.

479
00:24:15.036 --> 00:24:17.076
And look. the controls are right here.
It's perfect.

480
00:24:17.122 --> 00:24:19.124
- Will it get hot enough?
- 220 degrees.

481
00:24:19.541 --> 00:24:21.543
We just have to figure out
how to get him in here.

482
00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:23.226
- Then we lock him in...
- Heat him up...

483
00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:25.589
No matter what happens. we'll know.

484
00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:27.131
We'll know for sure.

485
00:24:33.555 --> 00:24:34.555
Hmm...

486
00:24:36.057 --> 00:24:38.977
- Yeah. I don't know.
- You don't know if you can fit?

487
00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.771
Oh. I can fit.
I just don't know if I want to.

488
00:24:41.855 --> 00:24:43.106
Are you claustrophobic?

489
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.150
I don't have phobias.

490
00:24:45.817 --> 00:24:48.612
- Okay. well. what's the problem?
- The problem is.

491
00:24:48.695 --> 00:24:50.697
I still haven't heard what's in this

492
00:24:51.072 --> 00:24:52.449
for Erica.

493
00:25:00.665 --> 00:25:01.958
More fudge. please.

494
00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:04.920
Go on.

495
00:25:10.425 --> 00:25:11.425
All right.

496
00:25:12.969 --> 00:25:16.014
You see this?
This is the route you're gonna take.

497
00:25:16.556 --> 00:25:18.837
Then we just wait till the last delivery
goes out tonight.

498
00:25:18.892 --> 00:25:21.603
Then you knock out the grate.
jump down. open the door.

499
00:25:21.686 --> 00:25:24.564
- Then you find out what's in those boxes?
- Exactly.

500
00:25:24.648 --> 00:25:25.565
Mm-hmm.

501
00:25:25.649 --> 00:25:27.359
And you say this guard is armed.

502
00:25:27.943 --> 00:25:29.027
Yes. but he won't be there.

503
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.071
- And booby traps?
- Booby traps?

504
00:25:31.154 --> 00:25:33.490
- Lasers. spikes in the wall?
- What?

505
00:25:33.573 --> 00:25:36.785
You know what this half-baked plan
of yours sounds like to me?

506
00:25:37.327 --> 00:25:38.954
Child endangerment.

507
00:25:39.037 --> 00:25:41.057
We'll be in radio contact with you
the whole time...

508
00:25:41.081 --> 00:25:42.415
Ah. ah. ah!

509
00:25:42.499 --> 00:25:44.918
Child endangerment.

510
00:25:45.752 --> 00:25:47.879
Erica? Hi. Uh...

511
00:25:47.963 --> 00:25:51.675
We think these Russians
want to do harm to our country.

512
00:25:51.758 --> 00:25:54.386
Great harm. Don't you love your country?

513
00:25:54.469 --> 00:25:57.097
You can't spell "America" without "Erica."

514
00:25:59.933 --> 00:26:01.601
Uh. yeah. yeah.

515
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:04.312
Oddly. that's. uh. totally true.

516
00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:06.314
So. so. don't do this for us.

517
00:26:06.398 --> 00:26:07.774
Do it for your country.

518
00:26:07.857 --> 00:26:10.151
Do it for your fellow man.

519
00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:13.780
Do this for America... Erica.

520
00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:16.490
Ooh!

521
00:26:16.533 --> 00:26:18.118
I just got the chills.

522
00:26:18.702 --> 00:26:20.078
Oh. yeah. from this float.

523
00:26:20.161 --> 00:26:21.371
not your speech.

524
00:26:21.871 --> 00:26:24.416
Know what I love most about this country?

525
00:26:24.499 --> 00:26:25.542
Capitalism.

526
00:26:25.625 --> 00:26:27.544
- Do you know what capitalism is?
- Yeah.

527
00:26:27.627 --> 00:26:30.964
- Yeah.
- It means this is a free market system.

528
00:26:31.047 --> 00:26:33.216
Which means people get paid
for their services.

529
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.011
depending on how valuable
their contributions are.

530
00:26:36.094 --> 00:26:37.512
And it seems to me.

531
00:26:37.596 --> 00:26:40.557
my ability to fit into that little vent

532
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.226
is very. very valuable to you all.

533
00:26:43.518 --> 00:26:45.604
So. you want my help?

534
00:26:45.687 --> 00:26:47.439
This USS <i>Butterscotch</i>

535
00:26:47.522 --> 00:26:49.566
better be the first of many.

536
00:26:49.649 --> 00:26:51.860
And I'm talking free ice cream

537
00:26:52.402 --> 00:26:54.321
for life.

538
00:27:03.705 --> 00:27:05.415
Wow. I love the place. Lar.

539
00:27:05.498 --> 00:27:07.876
Hey. you shoot that fella yourself?

540
00:27:07.959 --> 00:27:10.420
That's... That's not real.

541
00:27:10.503 --> 00:27:12.714
No shit!

542
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.270
All right. so...

543
00:27:28.855 --> 00:27:30.774
what exactly are we looking at?

544
00:27:30.857 --> 00:27:33.193
Land deeds. transfers of property.

545
00:27:33.276 --> 00:27:34.694
So your buddies at Starcourt.

546
00:27:34.778 --> 00:27:37.238
they suddenly start buying up
all this property.

547
00:27:38.114 --> 00:27:40.116
- They tell you why?
- I already told you.

548
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.368
they don't tell me anything.

549
00:27:41.451 --> 00:27:43.078
They're just using you. I get it.

550
00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:44.371
What I don't get

551
00:27:44.454 --> 00:27:47.874
is why you have a bunch of land deeds

552
00:27:47.957 --> 00:27:50.460
in a safe in your bedroom.

553
00:27:50.543 --> 00:27:51.878
These people. Jim.

554
00:27:53.254 --> 00:27:54.547
they're bad news.

555
00:27:54.631 --> 00:27:56.216
So. what. this is blackmail?

556
00:27:56.299 --> 00:27:58.468
- Protection.
- Protection.

557
00:27:59.094 --> 00:28:00.345
Hold on a second.

558
00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:04.349
Hey. what is it?

559
00:28:04.599 --> 00:28:06.726
Hess Farm. Henry's place.

560
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:07.936
Bullocks...

561
00:28:08.103 --> 00:28:09.354
Look. they're all here.

562
00:28:09.437 --> 00:28:12.607
They're all in Southeast Hawkins.
right near Jordan Lake.

563
00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:14.526
And what else is near Jordan Lake?

564
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:16.152
The power plant.

565
00:28:16.236 --> 00:28:19.239
Four nights ago.
there was a huge power outage.

566
00:28:19.322 --> 00:28:21.366
- and the next day...
- Your magnets fell.

567
00:28:21.449 --> 00:28:24.285
Yeah. I mean. Scott says that this machine

568
00:28:24.369 --> 00:28:26.955
would take a massive amount of power
to run.

569
00:28:27.038 --> 00:28:29.165
- Yeah.
- So. what if this machine

570
00:28:29.249 --> 00:28:32.001
that we've been talking about
really does exist.

571
00:28:32.085 --> 00:28:33.965
and the reason that we didn't find it
at the lab

572
00:28:34.003 --> 00:28:37.215
is because it isn't at the lab.
it's at one of these properties.

573
00:28:38.341 --> 00:28:39.341
Um...

574
00:28:39.634 --> 00:28:42.429
I want you to... forget about sales.

575
00:28:42.512 --> 00:28:44.597
I want you to come work for me
at the Hawkins PD.

576
00:28:44.681 --> 00:28:47.517
And have to look at your face every day?
I don't think so.

577
00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.105
Larry!

578
00:28:52.188 --> 00:28:53.231
Hey!

579
00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:57.193
Hey. where do you think you're going. pal?

580
00:29:01.489 --> 00:29:03.658
Nancy?

581
00:29:05.702 --> 00:29:06.786
Nance?

582
00:29:25.138 --> 00:29:27.015
<i>Maybe Jonathan's right.</i>

583
00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:30.351
To be honest. I wasn't thinking about him.

584
00:29:31.227 --> 00:29:33.229
I wasn't thinking about anyone. really.

585
00:29:34.397 --> 00:29:35.397
I just...

586
00:29:36.274 --> 00:29:37.525
I wanted to be right.

587
00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.905
- I wanted to be right so badly.
- And were you?

588
00:29:41.988 --> 00:29:43.698
I thought so.

589
00:29:45.658 --> 00:29:46.951
But maybe I just...

590
00:29:48.077 --> 00:29:49.662
don't want to admit that I'm wrong.

591
00:29:49.746 --> 00:29:53.166
- because if I'm wrong. then...
- You're what everyone thinks you are.

592
00:29:53.249 --> 00:29:55.960
Just a kid who has no idea
what she's doing.

593
00:30:02.717 --> 00:30:04.594
It's not easy out there. Nance.

594
00:30:04.677 --> 00:30:05.678
I know.

595
00:30:08.139 --> 00:30:10.141
People are always saying you can't.

596
00:30:11.226 --> 00:30:12.435
That you shouldn't.

597
00:30:14.813 --> 00:30:15.814
That you're not...

598
00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:18.525
smart enough. not good enough.

599
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:23.488
This world. it...

600
00:30:24.864 --> 00:30:28.284
it beats you up again and again
until eventually. I...

601
00:30:30.453 --> 00:30:31.955
Most people. they just...

602
00:30:32.956 --> 00:30:34.290
they just stop trying.

603
00:30:40.755 --> 00:30:42.215
But you're not like that.

604
00:30:43.633 --> 00:30:44.843
You're a fighter.

605
00:30:45.593 --> 00:30:46.970
You always have been.

606
00:30:48.596 --> 00:30:50.756
I honestly don't know
where you get it from.

607
00:30:51.224 --> 00:30:52.225
Dad.

608
00:30:57.564 --> 00:31:01.150
I think you were swapped in the hospital.
to tell you the truth.

609
00:31:01.776 --> 00:31:02.776
No.

610
00:31:05.238 --> 00:31:07.532
I get it from you. Mom.

611
00:31:10.785 --> 00:31:12.203
I get it from you.

612
00:31:17.667 --> 00:31:19.460
Well. wherever you get it from.

613
00:31:21.337 --> 00:31:22.337
I'm proud of you.

614
00:31:23.339 --> 00:31:25.008
Proud of me for getting fired?

615
00:31:25.967 --> 00:31:28.344
That you stood up for yourself.

616
00:31:28.678 --> 00:31:30.430
That you stood up to those...

617
00:31:30.513 --> 00:31:31.513
shitheads.

618
00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:33.433
Mom!

619
00:31:33.516 --> 00:31:35.268
Yes. those shitheads.

620
00:31:36.936 --> 00:31:38.938
And if you believe in this story...

621
00:31:39.606 --> 00:31:40.732
Look at me. Nancy.

622
00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:43.650
...finish it.

623
00:31:45.945 --> 00:31:49.949
Then go sell it to <i>The Indianapolis Star</i>
or whatever and...

624
00:31:50.783 --> 00:31:52.183
I mean. can you imagine their faces

625
00:31:52.243 --> 00:31:54.078
when they read a story
about their own town

626
00:31:54.162 --> 00:31:55.997
in a big paper like that?

627
00:31:56.539 --> 00:31:57.999
That would be...

628
00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:00.793
pretty amazing.

629
00:32:02.378 --> 00:32:03.671
So. why not?

630
00:32:07.091 --> 00:32:08.301
Why not?

631
00:32:09.719 --> 00:32:10.720
Finish it.

632
00:32:35.286 --> 00:32:36.286
Uh. Will?

633
00:32:37.246 --> 00:32:38.957
Um. you know. about yesterday...

634
00:32:39.791 --> 00:32:41.042
It's fine. Lucas.

635
00:32:41.125 --> 00:32:42.627
You don't have to say anything.

636
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:44.712
I know. but it's just...

637
00:32:46.714 --> 00:32:48.216
It was a really cool campaign.

638
00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:51.219
- And Mike and I. we should've never...
- I don't care anymore. Lucas.

639
00:32:51.302 --> 00:32:52.345
I really don't.

640
00:32:53.388 --> 00:32:55.306
We have bigger things to worry about now.

641
00:33:00.395 --> 00:33:01.437
This should hold him.

642
00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:10.822
Hey. I found the breakers.

643
00:33:11.906 --> 00:33:14.826
Whoa. that thing is super creepy.

644
00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:16.035
Let me see it.

645
00:33:16.911 --> 00:33:19.080
I think this'll work. Right. buddy?

646
00:33:19.163 --> 00:33:20.403
Right. Mike.

647
00:33:26.212 --> 00:33:27.255
Hey. El...

648
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:31.092
I just wanted to say...

649
00:33:32.343 --> 00:33:34.095
You know when I said Nana was sick?

650
00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:36.472
She wasn't. I lied.

651
00:33:36.556 --> 00:33:38.766
- I know.
- Right. right. right. No. I just...

652
00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:41.310
think it was important for you
to know the context.

653
00:33:41.894 --> 00:33:43.646
Hopper. he went all crazy on me.

654
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:45.730
telling me I'm spending
way too much time with you.

655
00:33:45.773 --> 00:33:47.608
He made me lie. I mean.

656
00:33:47.692 --> 00:33:49.819
you're the most important thing to me
in the world.

657
00:33:49.902 --> 00:33:51.195
What if he's right?

658
00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:52.864
- What?
- Hop.

659
00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:54.198
No. no. no. no.

660
00:33:54.282 --> 00:33:56.701
He's just some angry old man
who hates joy.

661
00:33:56.784 --> 00:33:59.495
But if I only see you.

662
00:33:59.829 --> 00:34:02.290
and I'm a different species than you.

663
00:34:02.373 --> 00:34:05.418
then I should be with my species more.

664
00:34:05.501 --> 00:34:06.878
What are you talking about?

665
00:34:10.089 --> 00:34:11.382
Did you spy on me?

666
00:34:11.466 --> 00:34:14.302
- That's totally against the rules.
- I make my own rules.

667
00:34:14.385 --> 00:34:16.137
- <i>Mike. are you there?</i>
- Yeah!

668
00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:19.140
- Where are you guys?
<i>- I'm coming. Just...</i>

669
00:34:19.223 --> 00:34:20.433
hold on a second.

670
00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:21.850
Shit!

671
00:34:26.481 --> 00:34:27.721
God. I hope it's not you.

672
00:34:30.276 --> 00:34:31.694
I really hope it's not you.

673
00:34:45.833 --> 00:34:47.335
Erica. do you copy?

674
00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.170
<i>Mm-hmm. I copy.</i>

675
00:34:49.253 --> 00:34:52.882
- You nerds in position or what?
<i>- Yeah. we're in position.</i>

676
00:34:52.965 --> 00:34:55.051
It's all quiet here.
so you've got the green light.

677
00:34:55.134 --> 00:34:56.761
Green light. roger that.

678
00:34:56.844 --> 00:35:00.264
Commence Operation Child Endangerment.

679
00:35:00.348 --> 00:35:02.350
Can we maybe not call it that?

680
00:35:02.433 --> 00:35:03.851
<i>See you on the other side.</i>

681
00:35:03.935 --> 00:35:04.935
Nerds.

682
00:35:20.743 --> 00:35:21.786
Winnie!

683
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:23.538
Winnie. is that you?

684
00:35:23.746 --> 00:35:27.291
- Larry?
- Winnie. upstairs in the bedroom!

685
00:35:27.875 --> 00:35:28.875
Baby.

686
00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:31.963
Oh. my God. baby. what happened?

687
00:35:32.046 --> 00:35:33.172
Get me a phone.

688
00:35:33.548 --> 00:35:36.217
- Baby...
- Get me a goddamn phone!

689
00:35:59.824 --> 00:36:00.824
Anything?

690
00:36:01.576 --> 00:36:02.577
No.

691
00:36:03.327 --> 00:36:04.620
This place is dead.

692
00:36:07.582 --> 00:36:09.208
All right. where to next?

693
00:36:09.792 --> 00:36:10.792
Hess Farm.

694
00:36:21.888 --> 00:36:23.264
All right. nerds.

695
00:36:23.347 --> 00:36:24.390
<i>I'm there.</i>

696
00:36:24.807 --> 00:36:26.017
Do you... Do you see anything?

697
00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:29.979
Yeah. I see those boring boxes
you're so excited about.

698
00:36:30.062 --> 00:36:31.731
- <i>Any guards?</i>
- Negative.

699
00:36:31.814 --> 00:36:33.941
- Booby traps?
- If I could see them.

700
00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:35.776
they'd be pretty shit traps.

701
00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:38.070
<i>- wouldn't they?</i>
- Thank you for that.

702
00:36:43.701 --> 00:36:44.701
I'm in.

703
00:36:45.411 --> 00:36:46.662
Oh. God.

704
00:36:53.294 --> 00:36:54.879
Free ice cream

705
00:36:54.962 --> 00:36:56.547
for life.

706
00:37:33.626 --> 00:37:34.710
Pool's closed.

707
00:37:37.046 --> 00:37:38.046
Hey.

708
00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:40.216
Do you hear me?

709
00:37:43.219 --> 00:37:44.720
Pool is closed!

710
00:37:52.019 --> 00:37:53.604
Billy!

711
00:37:56.023 --> 00:37:57.066
Who's there?

712
00:37:57.692 --> 00:37:59.610
Billy!

713
00:38:00.361 --> 00:38:01.988
Who's there?

714
00:38:04.365 --> 00:38:05.866
Billy!

715
00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:10.413
Billy!

716
00:38:10.496 --> 00:38:12.123
