00:00:20.023 --> 00:00:21.524
It's perfect.

3
00:00:21.608 --> 00:00:23.526
- Somewhere like...
- Yeah.

4
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.863
I can totally
see it. You in Indiana.

5
00:00:26.947 --> 00:00:28.406
- Indiana?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.494
Well. you have a certain stoic...
More Clint Eastwood than...

7
00:00:32.577 --> 00:00:34.537
Good news. my friends.

8
00:00:35.121 --> 00:00:36.414
Katinka feeling better.

9
00:00:36.498 --> 00:00:38.333
Shall we give her another try?

10
00:00:39.334 --> 00:00:40.835
Why not?

11
00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:42.461
Asshole.

12
00:00:42.504 --> 00:00:44.881
This guy.

13
00:01:05.468 --> 00:01:06.528
Yuri!

14
00:01:06.528 --> 00:01:07.528
That's enough.

15
00:01:07.988 --> 00:01:10.115
That's enough! Hey!

16
00:01:10.699 --> 00:01:12.409
The hell you think you're doing?

17
00:01:12.492 --> 00:01:14.828
Get your hands off me. potatohead.

18
00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:16.413
You're trying to break her. aren't ya?

19
00:01:16.496 --> 00:01:18.832
Get us captured again so you
can get your reward? That it?

20
00:01:18.915 --> 00:01:21.001
What do you two lizard brains know?

21
00:01:21.084 --> 00:01:22.335
You're engineers now?

22
00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:24.087
I know that sound is not good.

23
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.798
On contrary. those noises you hear.

24
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:28.883
that...

25
00:01:28.967 --> 00:01:29.967
... it's very good sign.

26
00:01:29.968 --> 00:01:31.344
- Good sign. huh?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:31.428 --> 00:01:34.222
My women make noise when I please them.

28
00:01:34.305 --> 00:01:36.182
You don't know what that
is like. I understand.

29
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:40.270
But for those like me who
knows what and where to touch.

30
00:01:40.353 --> 00:01:41.563
much noise.

31
00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:01.331
Yeah.

32
00:02:01.374 --> 00:02:03.710
These are the smallest I could find.

33
00:02:03.793 --> 00:02:05.253
That's it for shirts.

34
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.090
Oh. Well...

35
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.217
Cute.

36
00:02:12.302 --> 00:02:14.429
Yuri has good taste. What can I say?

37
00:02:18.558 --> 00:02:19.558
Um...

38
00:02:21.144 --> 00:02:22.144
- Oh. sorry.
- Sorry.

39
00:02:22.187 --> 00:02:23.813
- I'll go over here.
- Okay.

40
00:03:31.506 --> 00:03:33.174
What did they do to you?

41
00:03:35.135 --> 00:03:36.261
Oh my God.

42
00:03:36.344 --> 00:03:38.721
No. it's not that bad. It's...

43
00:03:39.806 --> 00:03:42.058
You know. I needed
to lose weight anyway.

44
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.436
It's given me time to think. you know?

45
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.772
About who I've been and...

46
00:03:49.607 --> 00:03:50.817
and what I've done.

47
00:03:55.321 --> 00:03:57.073
I never should've sent you that message.

48
00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.409
You didn't know what was gonna happen.

49
00:03:59.492 --> 00:04:01.202
I knew it'd be dangerous.

50
00:04:01.286 --> 00:04:02.412
So did I.

51
00:04:02.495 --> 00:04:04.372
I made this choice.

52
00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:08.418
And I would choose it again. even
knowing everything that I know.

53
00:04:09.002 --> 00:04:10.002
I would.

54
00:04:10.587 --> 00:04:13.923
Plus. you know. we do have
that date to get to.

55
00:04:14.007 --> 00:04:15.007
Remember?

56
00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:17.218
"Remember"?

57
00:04:17.927 --> 00:04:19.596
I've been dreaming about it.

58
00:04:19.679 --> 00:04:21.681
- Oh. yeah?
- Yeah.

59
00:04:21.681 --> 00:04:23.558
I have it all planned out.

60
00:04:24.142 --> 00:04:25.185
Pray tell.

61
00:04:25.268 --> 00:04:28.271
I'm getting two orders
of bread sticks. Two.

62
00:04:28.354 --> 00:04:30.273
Those things knock your socks off.

63
00:04:30.356 --> 00:04:31.858
Enzo puts some spice on 'em.

64
00:04:31.941 --> 00:04:33.902
I don't know what it is. but it's good.

65
00:04:33.985 --> 00:04:36.613
And you dip it in olive
oil? Forget about it.

66
00:04:36.696 --> 00:04:39.272
And. uh. I'm wavering on the main course

67
00:04:39.273 --> 00:04:40.450
between the veal and the lasagna.

68
00:04:40.533 --> 00:04:42.827
But I think I gotta
go with lasagna. right?

69
00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:48.082
So. you... you've been dreaming
about bread sticks and lasagna?

70
00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:53.087
I've been on a diet of watery
soup. moldy bread. and maggots.

71
00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:56.382
so. yeah. I've been dreaming
about bread sticks and lasagna.

72
00:04:56.466 --> 00:04:57.634
I mean. sue me.

73
00:05:00.053 --> 00:05:02.138
Should I have been dreaming
about something else?

74
00:05:03.056 --> 00:05:04.140
You tell me.

75
00:05:07.727 --> 00:05:08.727
Well.

76
00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:10.730
there's wine.

77
00:05:10.813 --> 00:05:12.065
Oh. well. wine's good.

78
00:05:12.148 --> 00:05:13.942
I was thinking about a nice "Cheeanti."

79
00:05:14.025 --> 00:05:16.611
- Chianti.
- Chianti. right.

80
00:05:17.487 --> 00:05:19.948
- Then there's dessert.
- You gotta have dessert.

81
00:05:20.031 --> 00:05:21.115
Gotta have dessert.

82
00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.742
And after that?

83
00:05:25.703 --> 00:05:26.703
I don't know.

84
00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.041
Use your imagination.

85
00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:33.294
Who needs imagination?

86
00:05:52.772 --> 00:05:55.233
- Damn it!
- Remember. they're listening!

87
00:05:59.362 --> 00:06:02.031
Okay. I wanna run
through it one more time.

88
00:06:03.866 --> 00:06:06.077
- Phase one.
- We meet Erica at the playground.

89
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.246
She'll signal Max and
Lucas when we're ready.

90
00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:10.206
- Phase two.
- Max baits Vecna.

91
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.250
He'll go after her. which'll
put him in his trance.

92
00:06:12.333 --> 00:06:14.711
- Phase three?
- Me and Eddie draw the bats away.

93
00:06:14.712 --> 00:06:15.712
Four.

94
00:06:15.712 --> 00:06:18.339
We head into Vecna's
newly bat-free lair. and...

95
00:06:18.423 --> 00:06:20.258
... flambé.

96
00:06:20.883 --> 00:06:24.345
Nobody moves on to the next
phase until we've all copied.

97
00:06:24.887 --> 00:06:28.141
Nobody deviates from
the plan. no matter what.

98
00:06:28.917 --> 00:06:29.934
Got it?

99
00:06:29.934 --> 00:06:30.934
Got it.

100
00:06:56.794 --> 00:06:58.421
- Be careful.
- Thanks. buddy.

101
00:06:58.921 --> 00:07:00.548
Here goes nothing.

102
00:07:13.603 --> 00:07:16.397
What does he want us to do. applaud?

103
00:07:20.818 --> 00:07:22.612
All right.

104
00:07:23.363 --> 00:07:24.363
Let's go.

105
00:07:34.082 --> 00:07:35.083
Gotcha.

106
00:08:01.609 --> 00:08:02.944
Hey. guys. listen.

107
00:08:03.027 --> 00:08:07.031
If things here start to go
south. I mean. at all. you abort.

108
00:08:07.031 --> 00:08:09.117
Okay? Draw the attention of the bats.

109
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.828
Keep 'em busy for a minute or
two. We'll take care of Vecna.

110
00:08:12.412 --> 00:08:14.580
Don't try to be cute or
be a hero or something.

111
00:08:14.664 --> 00:08:16.999
- Okay? You guys are just...
- Decoys.

112
00:08:17.083 --> 00:08:19.252
Don't worry. You can be the hero. Steve.

113
00:08:19.335 --> 00:08:20.545
Absolutely. I mean.

114
00:08:20.628 --> 00:08:21.712
look at us.

115
00:08:22.547 --> 00:08:24.340
We are not heroes.

116
00:08:29.637 --> 00:08:30.680
Hey. Steve?

117
00:08:34.767 --> 00:08:35.767
Make him pay.

118
00:10:07.193 --> 00:10:10.029
No. no. Like I
said. I... I've tried everyone.

119
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.615
Yeah. TWA. Pan Am. Eastern.

120
00:10:13.157 --> 00:10:15.076
No. it doesn't have to be a one-way.

121
00:10:15.159 --> 00:10:16.911
I'll take one seat. if you have it.

122
00:10:20.289 --> 00:10:23.167
I mean. please. there has to
be something that you can do.

123
00:10:23.793 --> 00:10:26.128
One of our family members
is really. really sick.

124
00:10:26.212 --> 00:10:28.798
and I don't know if she's
gonna make it through the night.

125
00:10:30.091 --> 00:10:31.968
Is there any way that you could just...

126
00:10:33.386 --> 00:10:35.221
No. No. No.

127
00:10:35.304 --> 00:10:37.723
Like I said before. I...
I've tried them already.

128
00:10:39.517 --> 00:10:43.604
Okay. well. is there any way
that I could speak to a manager?

129
00:10:45.898 --> 00:10:47.525
There... There's no one there?

130
00:10:49.819 --> 00:10:52.071
No. that's the problem.
I can't call back.

131
00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:00.037
Breathe. Sunflower.

132
00:11:00.621 --> 00:11:02.999
Rainbow. Three to the
right. Four to the...

133
00:11:03.666 --> 00:11:04.750
Three.

134
00:11:05.459 --> 00:11:06.459
Rainbow.

135
00:11:09.964 --> 00:11:11.674
Get away!

136
00:11:12.466 --> 00:11:14.135
- Damn it.
- What'd they say?

137
00:11:14.218 --> 00:11:15.303
Earliest is tomorrow.

138
00:11:15.386 --> 00:11:16.971
- No. That's way too late.
- Shit.

139
00:11:17.054 --> 00:11:18.764
- I know.
- Hey. dudes?

140
00:11:18.848 --> 00:11:20.850
Ask 'em if we can ride in
the baggage compartment.

141
00:11:20.933 --> 00:11:22.143
The baggage compartment?

142
00:11:23.686 --> 00:11:24.686
We'd suffocate.

143
00:11:24.729 --> 00:11:27.023
Dogs ride in there all the time. man.

144
00:11:27.607 --> 00:11:28.733
They don't suffocate.

145
00:11:28.816 --> 00:11:29.984
- Jesus Christ.
- Holy shit.

146
00:11:30.067 --> 00:11:31.067
I have a way.

147
00:11:32.737 --> 00:11:34.405
A way to protect Max.

148
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:37.283
From here.

149
00:11:41.871 --> 00:11:43.205
This is Max.

150
00:11:44.665 --> 00:11:47.376
When One attacks. he'll be in her mind.

151
00:11:48.586 --> 00:11:49.754
But I can do that too.

152
00:11:50.254 --> 00:11:52.715
I went into Mama's mind. into Billy's.

153
00:11:52.798 --> 00:11:54.258
I can go into Max's.

154
00:11:54.842 --> 00:11:56.636
She can carry me to Vecna.

155
00:11:56.719 --> 00:11:57.803
I can piggyback.

156
00:11:57.887 --> 00:11:59.305
I can protect her.

157
00:11:59.847 --> 00:12:00.973
From One.

158
00:12:01.057 --> 00:12:02.433
Fight him from here.

159
00:12:02.516 --> 00:12:04.310
Mind fight. Righteous.

160
00:12:04.393 --> 00:12:06.020
Wait. so you actually
think this can work?

161
00:12:06.103 --> 00:12:07.396
A bathtub would help.

162
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.066
Yeah. Gotta be clean to enter the mind.

163
00:12:10.149 --> 00:12:12.693
What? No. no. It's a
sensory deprivation tank.

164
00:12:12.777 --> 00:12:14.945
It helps her calm down
and focus on her powers.

165
00:12:15.029 --> 00:12:17.740
Wait. we... we just passed a motel.

166
00:12:17.823 --> 00:12:19.575
Yeah. but they won't have enough salt.

167
00:12:19.659 --> 00:12:22.161
Well. how much salt are
we talking here. my dudes?

168
00:12:22.244 --> 00:12:24.705
Well. depends on the size
of the tub. but a lot.

169
00:12:25.748 --> 00:12:27.208
Does 600 pounds suffice?

170
00:12:27.291 --> 00:12:30.044
You know a place that
has 600 pounds of salt?

171
00:12:32.588 --> 00:12:33.714
Let's see...

172
00:12:35.216 --> 00:12:36.216
Yep.

173
00:12:37.343 --> 00:12:38.343
Mm-hmm.

174
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.263
Yep. It'll work.

175
00:12:41.347 --> 00:12:42.390
What will work?

176
00:12:42.473 --> 00:12:44.767
I know a magical place
that has all you need.

177
00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.727
my brave. little superpowered friend.

178
00:12:46.811 --> 00:12:49.188
That mind fight is on.

179
00:12:49.271 --> 00:12:50.523
Come on.

180
00:12:50.606 --> 00:12:52.650
¡Vámonos! Let's go! Pronto!

♪ Do you want to know ♪
♪ That it doesn't hurt me? ♪

182
00:13:15.464 --> 00:13:16.632
♪ Yeah. yeah ♪

183

184
00:15:36.647 --> 00:15:38.732
Hey!

185
00:15:42.027 --> 00:15:44.154
- I think we got something.
- Send Ryan.

186
00:15:44.738 --> 00:15:47.908
I don't wanna waste any more
time with bullshit leads.

187
00:15:48.617 --> 00:15:50.870
I don't think you'll wanna
send Ryan on this one.

188
00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.041
You know the murder house on Morehead?

189
00:15:56.834 --> 00:15:57.834
Yeah.

190
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.170
What about it?

191
00:16:04.592 --> 00:16:07.720
Okay. and. uh. who exactly
was this mystery woman?

192
00:16:07.803 --> 00:16:08.846
Not sure.

193
00:16:09.471 --> 00:16:11.807
I mean. she wasn't
exactly Miss Talkative.

194
00:16:11.891 --> 00:16:15.227
You know? I spent five minutes
trying to convince her I was real.

195
00:16:15.311 --> 00:16:17.187
I'm supposed to be dead. remember?

196
00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:19.273
Anyway. I finally get around
to half-convincing her.

197
00:16:19.356 --> 00:16:21.358
she starts to open up a
little. then says that she's...

198
00:16:21.442 --> 00:16:22.651
A friend of the doc's.

199
00:16:22.735 --> 00:16:24.987
Great. so am I. Now put
me on the phone with him.

200
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.448
I'm afraid the doc is indisposed.

201
00:16:27.531 --> 00:16:28.866
"Indisposed"?

202
00:16:29.825 --> 00:16:31.035
It gets worse.

203
00:16:32.328 --> 00:16:33.996
She said the doc's with the girl.

204
00:16:34.079 --> 00:16:36.999
And the girl went off to
fight some evil in Hawkins.

205
00:16:38.584 --> 00:16:41.462
Then they all went off-grid.
The doc. the girl. everybody.

206
00:16:42.046 --> 00:16:44.465
"The girl." meaning... El.

207
00:16:45.382 --> 00:16:46.592
Yeah. it has to be.

208
00:16:49.011 --> 00:16:50.763
This is your daughter. American?

209
00:16:50.846 --> 00:16:52.181
Mm-hmm.

210
00:16:52.681 --> 00:16:53.807
And they're not alone.

211
00:16:55.392 --> 00:16:56.810
Joyce's kids are with 'em.

212
00:17:03.776 --> 00:17:05.569
Okay. I... I see the mood here is bleak.

213
00:17:05.653 --> 00:17:07.696
And understandably so.

214
00:17:08.405 --> 00:17:11.241
But I do think we need to consider

215
00:17:11.325 --> 00:17:13.369
the very real possibility

216
00:17:13.452 --> 00:17:17.122
that this mystery
woman is. in fact. KGB.

217
00:17:17.206 --> 00:17:18.582
- And she's...
- No.

218
00:17:18.666 --> 00:17:20.292
She's telling the truth.

219
00:17:20.376 --> 00:17:22.586
When we were in the lab.
those particles we saw.

220
00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:24.296
they were alive.

221
00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:28.342
And if they're alive. that
means a gate's open in Hawkins.

222
00:17:28.425 --> 00:17:30.678
"Gate"? What does this mean?

223
00:17:30.761 --> 00:17:32.846
It means we have to go home right now.

224
00:17:33.681 --> 00:17:36.016
What is taking so long?

225
00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.935
I thought you said he was close.

226
00:17:38.018 --> 00:17:40.312
Yeah. close to sabotaging us. you mean.

227
00:17:40.396 --> 00:17:42.314
We think he's playing us again.

228
00:17:42.398 --> 00:17:44.483
So put a goddamn gun to his head.

229
00:17:44.566 --> 00:17:47.152
And then what? He just
spits out more lies.

230
00:17:47.236 --> 00:17:48.570
It's moot anyway.

231
00:17:48.654 --> 00:17:51.615
If your kids are truly in
some kind of imminent danger.

232
00:17:51.699 --> 00:17:54.410
even if we were to leave this very
moment. we wouldn't make it in time.

233
00:17:54.493 --> 00:17:56.495
The earliest we'd get
there is late tomorrow.

234
00:17:56.578 --> 00:17:58.580
No. we... we don't have to make it back.

235
00:17:58.664 --> 00:17:59.707
Not tonight.

236
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.375
Whatever this evil is.

237
00:18:01.458 --> 00:18:03.836
we know it's connected to the hive mind.

238
00:18:03.919 --> 00:18:06.630
And now we know part of
that hive mind is in Russia.

239
00:18:06.714 --> 00:18:08.924
So we don't need to get
back to Hawkins to fight it.

240
00:18:09.008 --> 00:18:10.718
All we need is to
destroy those particles.

241
00:18:10.801 --> 00:18:11.969
And if we're lucky.

242
00:18:12.052 --> 00:18:15.264
it'll hurt it enough to
give the kids the upper hand.

243
00:18:15.347 --> 00:18:16.432
Wait. time out.

244
00:18:17.349 --> 00:18:21.020
We're talking about the
particles inside the prison?

245
00:18:21.103 --> 00:18:23.814
The prison that we just
narrowly escaped from?

246
00:18:23.897 --> 00:18:24.982
We broke out.

247
00:18:25.774 --> 00:18:27.026
We can break back in.

248
00:18:27.509 --> 00:18:28.527
Jim!

249
00:18:28.527 --> 00:18:31.822
The entire Soviet
army is looking for us.

250
00:18:31.905 --> 00:18:34.616
Sure. And we'll be exactly
where they least expect.

251
00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.162
All right. There is a fine line
between courage and stupidity.

252
00:18:38.245 --> 00:18:40.956
and this falls very far
on the side of stupid.

253
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.416
This is Dirty Dozen stuff.

254
00:18:42.499 --> 00:18:44.752
Except there are. uh. four of us.

255
00:18:44.835 --> 00:18:46.503
Three. actually.

256
00:18:47.296 --> 00:18:49.923
Breaking back in's gonna
be easier than breaking out.

257
00:18:50.007 --> 00:18:52.926
Which is why we need an airlift.
This is where you come in.

258
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:54.136
I don't care what it takes.

259
00:18:54.219 --> 00:18:57.014
You get Yuri in line. and
you get that bird in the air.

260
00:18:57.806 --> 00:18:58.806
On it.

261
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:03.228
Yu... Yuri mentioned something
about a flamethrower. right?

262
00:19:09.359 --> 00:19:10.359
Oh. yeah.

263
00:19:10.402 --> 00:19:11.402
This'll do.

264
00:19:12.362 --> 00:19:13.739
This'll do just fine.

265
00:19:31.423 --> 00:19:32.591
You gotta be shitting me.

266
00:19:35.302 --> 00:19:37.596
Trust me on this one. my dudes.

267
00:19:46.313 --> 00:19:49.149
Surf's up. my dude.

268
00:19:50.109 --> 00:19:51.610
Uh. whoa.

269
00:19:52.194 --> 00:19:53.987
Nice shirt. my dude.

270
00:19:54.071 --> 00:19:55.322
Thanks. my dude.

271
00:19:55.405 --> 00:20:00.160
Uh. listen. I would love
to feed a fellow Surfer Boy.

272
00:20:00.244 --> 00:20:02.871
but kitchen closed.
like. five minutes ago.

273
00:20:02.955 --> 00:20:05.332
so no more pies tonight. man.

274
00:20:05.415 --> 00:20:07.084
That's all right. my dude.

275
00:20:07.167 --> 00:20:09.378
We're not here for your tasty pies.

276
00:20:09.461 --> 00:20:11.380
You see this weird girl behind me?

277
00:20:11.463 --> 00:20:13.223
She needs a tub with a bunch of salt

278
00:20:13.224 --> 00:20:14.800
so we can enhance her psychic power

279
00:20:14.883 --> 00:20:18.262
so she can save the world
from this super bad dude.

280
00:20:18.345 --> 00:20:20.055
But to make this salty tub.

281
00:20:20.556 --> 00:20:22.099
we require your kitchen.

282
00:20:22.182 --> 00:20:23.183
Ah.

283
00:20:25.102 --> 00:20:26.812
Well. it's just. uh...

284
00:20:26.895 --> 00:20:28.981
I'm supposed to meet Chaz at Taco Bell

285
00:20:29.064 --> 00:20:31.733
in. like. ten. So...

286
00:20:35.721 --> 00:20:36.780
My dude.

287
00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.782
We're not asking you to help for free.

288
00:20:38.866 --> 00:20:40.284
You ever partake in...

289
00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:42.911
Purple Palm Tree Delight?

290
00:20:43.537 --> 00:20:45.581
It'll make all your troubles float away.

291
00:20:45.664 --> 00:20:48.917
Like the seed pods of
a dandelion in the wind.

292
00:21:07.186 --> 00:21:10.189
First-ever mind fight held
in a pizza dough freezer.

293
00:21:10.856 --> 00:21:12.399
Pretty rad. right?

294
00:22:16.546 --> 00:22:17.547
Not bad.

295
00:22:18.215 --> 00:22:19.424
Not bad at all.

296
00:22:23.053 --> 00:22:24.304
Now for the fun part.

297
00:22:27.057 --> 00:22:28.350
Jesus Chr...

298
00:22:31.019 --> 00:22:36.233
It's like... she was destined
for an alternate dimension.

299
00:22:39.569 --> 00:22:41.238
What do you say. Henderson?

300
00:22:44.157 --> 00:22:48.954
Are you ready for the most metal
concert in the history of the world?

301
00:22:50.414 --> 00:22:52.040
That a rhetorical question?

302
00:22:55.502 --> 00:22:56.502
Let's do it.

303
00:23:03.885 --> 00:23:08.307
Uh... I don't
mean to freak anyone out.

304
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:10.767
but I swear we've seen this tree before.

305
00:23:11.268 --> 00:23:13.895
- That's impossible.
- That would suck. right?

306
00:23:14.521 --> 00:23:16.457
If Vecna destroyed the world because...

307
00:23:16.458 --> 00:23:18.525
'cause we got lost in the woods?

308
00:23:18.608 --> 00:23:20.485
We're not lost. Robin.

309
00:23:20.569 --> 00:23:22.904
Robin. hey. Watch out
for the vines! Hive mind.

310
00:23:22.988 --> 00:23:24.448
- Remember?
- Thank you!

311
00:23:25.449 --> 00:23:27.034
Uh. don't worry about her.

312
00:23:27.117 --> 00:23:28.201
She's just stressed.

313
00:23:28.285 --> 00:23:29.619
You know. scared.

314
00:23:29.703 --> 00:23:31.538
Yeah. Yeah. I... I know.

315
00:23:32.289 --> 00:23:33.289
It's just...

316
00:23:33.874 --> 00:23:35.000
She's a super klutz?

317
00:23:37.586 --> 00:23:41.506
She did tell me that it took her
longer to walk than most babies. so...

318
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.425
I really shouldn't laugh.

319
00:23:44.885 --> 00:23:45.885
When I was a baby.

320
00:23:45.886 --> 00:23:48.430
I actually crawled backwards.

321
00:23:48.513 --> 00:23:50.682
Crawled backwards?

322
00:23:50.766 --> 00:23:54.061
You know. I'd push with my
hands like this. Beep. Beep.

323
00:23:54.811 --> 00:23:56.480
Always in reverse. you know?

324
00:23:57.064 --> 00:23:59.483
Come on. it makes sense.
You push to move. right?

325
00:23:59.566 --> 00:24:01.860
No. no. it doesn't make sense.

326
00:24:01.943 --> 00:24:04.488
Well. it did to my tiny
little Harrington brain.

327
00:24:05.113 --> 00:24:08.283
That is. until I reversed my
baby butt down a flight of stairs

328
00:24:08.367 --> 00:24:10.369
and thumped my head really good.

329
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:11.370
Yeah.

330
00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:14.414
Wow. That explains

331
00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.166
so much.

332
00:24:16.249 --> 00:24:17.667
Yeah.

333
00:24:17.751 --> 00:24:19.336
I think it kinda does.

334
00:24:19.419 --> 00:24:22.589
I think. like. right out of the
gate. like. I'm super confident.

335
00:24:22.672 --> 00:24:24.466
But I'm also. like. an idiot.

336
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:26.968
Which is just... I mean.
it's a brutal combination.

337
00:24:28.053 --> 00:24:29.679
But. I mean. the good news is.

338
00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.725
I get a big enough thump on my
head. I can change. you know?

339
00:24:34.476 --> 00:24:35.477
I can learn.

340
00:24:36.895 --> 00:24:37.895
I can

341
00:24:38.605 --> 00:24:39.689
crawl forward.

342
00:24:41.066 --> 00:24:42.290
Listen. I guess what I'm trying to say

343
00:24:42.291 --> 00:24:45.737
in a really stupid.
roundabout way is. um...

344
00:24:46.738 --> 00:24:48.824
... is thank you.

345
00:24:49.599 --> 00:24:50.659
Thank me?

346
00:24:50.659 --> 00:24:52.160
- Yeah.
- For... ?

347
00:24:52.244 --> 00:24:54.413
For giving my head the
biggest thump of its life

348
00:24:54.496 --> 00:24:55.496
two years ago.

349
00:24:57.165 --> 00:24:58.417
I needed it.

350
00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:01.378
It's changed my life.

351
00:25:02.629 --> 00:25:05.257
And now I'm crawling forward.

352
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.801
Slowly.

353
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.679
I just wonder sometimes...

354
00:25:12.681 --> 00:25:15.805
you know. if... some
other girl had given me

355
00:25:15.806 --> 00:25:17.018
a proper thump before we'd met.

356
00:25:17.102 --> 00:25:19.354
would things have been different?

357
00:25:19.855 --> 00:25:21.325
Like. if we were meeting together

358
00:25:21.326 --> 00:25:23.567
for the first time
right now. part of me...

359
00:25:24.192 --> 00:25:26.611
I dunno. part of me
thinks we would've made it.

360
00:25:28.363 --> 00:25:29.363
Steve...

361
00:25:31.199 --> 00:25:32.868
Remember the dream I told you about?

362
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:35.871
About the Winnebago?

363
00:25:35.954 --> 00:25:37.956
Seeing the country with
my six lil' nuggets?

364
00:25:40.709 --> 00:25:41.918
It's all true.

365
00:25:42.002 --> 00:25:43.044
Every last word.

366
00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.007
But I left one part out.

367
00:25:48.592 --> 00:25:50.093
It's the most important part.

368
00:25:53.555 --> 00:25:54.848
You're there.

369
00:25:59.853 --> 00:26:01.354
You've always been there.

370
00:26:10.113 --> 00:26:11.239
Hey. guys!

371
00:26:11.323 --> 00:26:12.949
You guys! Awesome news!

372
00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.787
Looks like we weren't going
the wrong way after all.

373
00:26:19.664 --> 00:26:20.664
Come on.

374
00:26:22.584 --> 00:26:23.793
- Let's go!
- Okay.

375
00:26:25.212 --> 00:26:27.255
Ro... Slow down! Ro... Robin!

376
00:26:46.066 --> 00:26:47.066
Erica.

377
00:26:58.703 --> 00:26:59.955
Where are the guards?

378
00:27:01.122 --> 00:27:03.166
Maybe this'll be easier than we thought.

379
00:27:04.918 --> 00:27:08.213
I don't know. Jim. I got
a bad feeling about this.

380
00:28:14.738 --> 00:28:16.323
I have a question.

381
00:28:17.365 --> 00:28:19.284
What if I don't want to answer?

382
00:28:20.243 --> 00:28:21.661
Have you always been a coward?

383
00:28:25.707 --> 00:28:26.958
Yuri Ismaylov

384
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.337
is many things. you traitor.

385
00:28:30.629 --> 00:28:32.047
But he is...

386
00:28:32.631 --> 00:28:33.631
no coward.

387
00:28:35.175 --> 00:28:36.843
If that is so.

388
00:28:36.926 --> 00:28:38.386
why do you continue to stall?

389
00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.972
What do I owe these Americans?

390
00:28:41.056 --> 00:28:42.057
Nothing!

391
00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.768
This isn't just about America. smuggler.

392
00:28:47.979 --> 00:28:52.567
They have warned us of a
great evil in the world.

393
00:28:53.068 --> 00:28:56.321
An evil that does not rest.

394
00:28:56.404 --> 00:28:58.239
that does not respect borders.

395
00:28:58.323 --> 00:29:01.117
After it has consumed
everything in their land.

396
00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:03.495
it will come for us.

397
00:29:04.371 --> 00:29:05.413
For our families.

398
00:29:06.665 --> 00:29:07.791
For our Motherland.

399
00:29:10.752 --> 00:29:13.004
You saw it with your own eyes.

400
00:29:13.088 --> 00:29:14.881
You know it to be true.

401
00:29:14.964 --> 00:29:17.926
And yet you continue to play tricks!

402
00:29:26.976 --> 00:29:30.146
I was told the Peanut Butter Smuggler

403
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:32.440
was once a great man.

404
00:29:33.233 --> 00:29:35.819
Before he lost his
way to drink and cards.

405
00:29:35.902 --> 00:29:39.823
That he led his men to victory
over the Chinese in Damansky.

406
00:29:40.407 --> 00:29:41.407
Is it true?

407
00:29:42.225 --> 00:29:43.243
It is true.

408
00:29:43.243 --> 00:29:46.037
That hero. where is he now?

409
00:29:47.914 --> 00:29:49.624
Because I do not see him.

Max is moving into phase
two: distracting Vecna.

424
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:39.919
So far. so smooth.

425

Asshole!

436
00:33:52.742 --> 00:33:53.742
I'm here.

437
00:33:56.204 --> 00:33:57.205
No more music.

438
00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.124
No more games.

439
00:34:06.881 --> 00:34:07.882
Do you hear me?

440
00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:13.429
What are you waiting for. huh?

441
00:34:15.056 --> 00:34:16.891
Come on! Do you want me or not?

442
00:34:57.974 --> 00:34:59.267
Okay. almost done.

443
00:35:01.227 --> 00:35:05.356
Okay. so. hopefully this blocks
out any peripheral light. right?

444
00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:09.110
And it's totally dark.
which means it works.

445
00:35:09.193 --> 00:35:11.195
But I have one more important question:

446
00:35:11.638 --> 00:35:12.655
do I look cool?

447
00:35:12.655 --> 00:35:14.615
Feel like I look really cool.

448
00:35:14.699 --> 00:35:15.720
Are you giggling?

449
00:35:15.721 --> 00:35:17.994
You're giggling because I look awesome.

450
00:35:18.077 --> 00:35:19.443
I can't see it. but
I know you're smiling

451
00:35:19.444 --> 00:35:21.372
because I look so good. Right?

452
00:35:21.873 --> 00:35:23.291
- Mike.
- Yeah?

453
00:35:27.628 --> 00:35:28.628
I...

454
00:35:30.089 --> 00:35:31.089
missed you.

455
00:35:33.051 --> 00:35:35.261
Yeah.

456
00:35:35.344 --> 00:35:36.721
Yeah. I missed you too.

457
00:35:37.305 --> 00:35:38.347
You know.

458
00:35:38.431 --> 00:35:42.435
the last few days. I... I've had
to think about the last talk we had.

459
00:35:43.603 --> 00:35:45.480
You know. before the cops and...

460
00:35:45.563 --> 00:35:47.065
the whole world went to shit?

461
00:35:49.233 --> 00:35:51.486
I... I guess

462
00:35:52.445 --> 00:35:53.445
I just...

463
00:35:53.988 --> 00:35:54.988
I dunno.

464
00:35:54.989 --> 00:35:57.742
I guess I just wanted to say that...

465
00:35:57.825 --> 00:35:59.911
Surf's up. Romeo.

466
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:03.785
Oh. uh. too much flavor awesomeness

467
00:36:03.786 --> 00:36:05.917
can't overpower your battery. can it?

468
00:36:06.626 --> 00:36:09.253
- Dude. this is pineapple.
- Try before you deny.

469
00:36:14.342 --> 00:36:15.551
- Good.
- Hmm?

470
00:36:15.635 --> 00:36:18.137
- It's good? What do you mean?
- Really good.

471
00:36:18.221 --> 00:36:21.474
What? That's insane. Blasphemous.
Putting fruit on pizza?

472
00:36:21.557 --> 00:36:23.643
- Did you try? Try before you deny.
- No. I...

473
00:36:23.726 --> 00:36:26.229
- Try before you deny!
- Stop! Enough! I'm not a dog!

474
00:36:26.312 --> 00:36:28.564
- No. not a baby! Thank you!
- Try some.

475
00:36:28.648 --> 00:36:30.817
- Try before you deny!
- No!

476
00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:33.486
No! Stop it!

477
00:36:33.569 --> 00:36:36.030
Okay! Okay!

478
00:36:38.449 --> 00:36:40.952
No. you're right. It's good.

479
00:36:49.335 --> 00:36:50.910
Do you remember that time you told me

480
00:36:50.911 --> 00:36:52.338
you had a Lego stuck up your nose?

481
00:36:53.156 --> 00:36:54.215
- What?
- Yeah.

482
00:36:54.215 --> 00:36:57.009
Like. it was like a... It
was like a construction guy.

483
00:36:57.093 --> 00:36:59.554
You'd call him Larry. Come
on! You don't remember?

484
00:36:59.637 --> 00:37:01.889
He had the high viz
jacket and removable hat?

485
00:37:01.973 --> 00:37:02.973
Yeah.

486
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:04.349
Vaguely.

487
00:37:04.934 --> 00:37:07.436
Well. I remember it
like it was yesterday.

488
00:37:08.312 --> 00:37:10.439
Man. I was... I was freaked.

489
00:37:10.523 --> 00:37:14.277
'Cause... 'Cause this Larry... I
mean. Larry was way. way up there.

490
00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.195
I don't even know how
you got him that far up.

491
00:37:16.279 --> 00:37:18.698
I had to do surgery. I... I had
to get tweezers to pull him out.

492
00:37:18.781 --> 00:37:20.199
- Bull.
- No.

493
00:37:20.283 --> 00:37:22.285
No. no. I swear on my life.

494
00:37:26.455 --> 00:37:27.707
I don't know. I just...

495
00:37:30.042 --> 00:37:32.295
I feel like you used to
come to me more for help.

496
00:37:33.713 --> 00:37:35.965
Or to just... talk. you know?

497
00:37:37.008 --> 00:37:39.010
'Cause. like. you don't do that anymore.

498
00:37:40.136 --> 00:37:41.429
Not like before.

499
00:37:42.346 --> 00:37:44.307
A lot of that is probably my fault.

500
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:46.100
This last year...

501
00:37:47.977 --> 00:37:49.312
... I know I've been distant.

502
00:37:50.021 --> 00:37:51.480
Or stoned.

503
00:37:53.065 --> 00:37:54.317
Or stoned.

504
00:37:54.318 --> 00:37:55.318
Yeah.

505
00:37:55.318 --> 00:37:57.236
But that has nothing to do with you.

506
00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.280
And that's me dealing with my own shit.

507
00:37:59.363 --> 00:38:00.907
Hiding from my own problems.

508
00:38:01.824 --> 00:38:02.867
The truth is.

509
00:38:03.492 --> 00:38:04.702
I miss talking to you.

510
00:38:05.912 --> 00:38:07.205
I. like. really miss it.

511
00:38:08.247 --> 00:38:09.247
And I think.

512
00:38:09.707 --> 00:38:10.708
right now.

513
00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:12.877
we need to talk more than ever.

514
00:38:13.669 --> 00:38:15.838
Because things are
getting just complicated.

515
00:38:15.922 --> 00:38:19.217
A lot more complicated than
Legos up the nose. you know?

516
00:38:19.842 --> 00:38:20.842
I just...

517
00:38:22.178 --> 00:38:24.263
I don't want you to
forget that I'm here.

518
00:38:25.139 --> 00:38:26.349
And I'll always be here.

519
00:38:27.516 --> 00:38:28.517
No matter what.

520
00:38:29.227 --> 00:38:30.811
Because you're my brother.

521
00:38:31.437 --> 00:38:32.688
And I love you.

522
00:38:33.522 --> 00:38:36.400
And there is nothing
in this world. okay.

523
00:38:36.984 --> 00:38:38.486
absolutely nothing.

524
00:38:39.278 --> 00:38:40.696
that will ever change that.

525
00:38:41.447 --> 00:38:42.615
You got that?

526
00:38:42.698 --> 00:38:43.908
Yeah.

527
00:38:44.784 --> 00:38:46.160
And I'm always

528
00:38:47.161 --> 00:38:48.161
here for you too.

529
00:38:48.621 --> 00:38:49.622
I know.

530
00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.458
I know you are.

531
00:38:52.458 --> 00:38:54.377
Come here.

532
00:39:03.469 --> 00:39:04.470
It's gonna be okay.

533
00:39:05.596 --> 00:39:07.014
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

534
00:39:12.019 --> 00:39:13.145
I think it's ready.

535
00:39:14.146 --> 00:39:15.146
All right.

536
00:39:18.317 --> 00:39:19.317
It's time.

537
00:40:02.987 --> 00:40:04.989
Wild.

538
00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:29.180
I found them.

539
00:40:31.098 --> 00:40:32.975
They're carrying a light.

540
00:40:34.185 --> 00:40:35.561
A blue light.

541
00:41:06.425 --> 00:41:07.760
What are you waiting for. asshole?

542
00:41:08.427 --> 00:41:10.471
Hmm? I'm right here.

543
00:41:11.055 --> 00:41:12.390
I'm right here!

544
00:41:12.473 --> 00:41:14.100
Okay. El. what's going on?

545
00:41:15.267 --> 00:41:16.519
It's not working.

546
00:41:16.602 --> 00:41:18.145
What? What's not working?

547
00:41:18.729 --> 00:41:20.106
Max's plan.

548
00:41:21.565 --> 00:41:22.775
I know you can hear me.

549
00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.986
I know you can read my thoughts.

550
00:41:28.823 --> 00:41:30.157
Even the worst ones.

551
00:41:33.244 --> 00:41:34.912
Maybe mostly the worst ones.

552
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:02.731
I thought about what you said.

553
00:42:06.277 --> 00:42:08.571
About how I wanted my brother to die.

554
00:42:13.409 --> 00:42:15.536
I thought you were
just trying to upset me.

555
00:42:17.496 --> 00:42:18.539
To anger me.

556
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:24.253
But you weren't. were you?

557
00:42:29.091 --> 00:42:30.718
You were just telling the truth.

558
00:42:32.136 --> 00:42:35.723
Billy. he made my life living hell.

559
00:42:38.058 --> 00:42:39.310
Every chance he got.

560
00:42:44.231 --> 00:42:46.192
So. sometimes...

561
00:42:48.736 --> 00:42:50.696
when I would lie in
bed at night. I would...

562
00:42:51.822 --> 00:42:53.574
I would pray...

563
00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:59.538
... I would pray that
something would happen to him.

564
00:43:02.208 --> 00:43:03.250
Something awful.

565
00:43:07.838 --> 00:43:11.550
I knew that he drove too
fast. so I would imagine him

566
00:43:12.092 --> 00:43:13.177
crashing.

567
00:43:15.554 --> 00:43:17.306
Dying in that stupid car.

568
00:43:22.394 --> 00:43:23.394
I just...

569
00:43:25.564 --> 00:43:27.399
I wanted him out of my life.

570
00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:30.610
Forever.

571
00:43:34.823 --> 00:43:36.158
I wanted him to disappear.

572
00:43:38.786 --> 00:43:40.246
The day that he died...

573
00:43:42.873 --> 00:43:45.876
I think that's why I just stood there.

574
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:47.710
Watched.

575
00:43:49.922 --> 00:43:53.133
Not because I was scared or... weak.

576
00:43:55.052 --> 00:43:56.052
But because...

577
00:43:58.264 --> 00:44:00.599
I didn't know if he
deserved to be saved.

578
00:44:04.895 --> 00:44:06.855
And I've tried to forgive myself.

579
00:44:10.359 --> 00:44:12.027
I've tried. but...

580
00:44:13.445 --> 00:44:14.445
I can't.

581
00:44:17.992 --> 00:44:18.992
I can't.

582
00:44:22.788 --> 00:44:23.914
So now...

583
00:44:26.709 --> 00:44:28.335
now. when I lie in bed at night...

584
00:44:31.171 --> 00:44:34.133
I pray that something will happen to me.

585
00:44:36.635 --> 00:44:39.096
That something terrible
will happen to me.

586
00:44:45.311 --> 00:44:46.687
So that's why I'm here.

587
00:44:49.315 --> 00:44:50.315
Because...

588
00:44:53.068 --> 00:44:54.987
I just want you to take me away.

589
00:44:59.158 --> 00:45:00.158
And I want you...

590
00:45:04.496 --> 00:45:05.623
to make me disappear.

591
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:14.048
Is that all true?

592
00:45:15.549 --> 00:45:17.259
You wanted Billy to die.

593
00:45:18.594 --> 00:45:19.803
Why are you talking?

594
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:25.017
You ever have thoughts
like that about me?

595
00:45:26.518 --> 00:45:27.603
What?

596
00:45:27.686 --> 00:45:29.605
No. Lucas. never.

597
00:45:29.688 --> 00:45:33.067
Normal people don't fantasize
about killing other people. Max.

598
00:45:33.734 --> 00:45:35.903
You realize that. right?

599
00:45:35.986 --> 00:45:36.986
Lucas. please.

600
00:45:37.529 --> 00:45:39.615
I thought you were getting better.

601
00:45:39.698 --> 00:45:42.201
But you're not. are you?

602
00:45:42.785 --> 00:45:43.827
You are sick.

603
00:45:43.911 --> 00:45:45.120
Lucas. you don't mean that.

604
00:45:47.206 --> 00:45:49.166
Maybe it is good he takes you.

605
00:45:49.249 --> 00:45:51.293
Maybe it's for the best.

606
00:45:51.377 --> 00:45:52.377
In fact...

607
00:45:54.004 --> 00:45:55.839
... I'm glad it's going to be you.

608
00:45:55.923 --> 00:45:57.883
You will be the chosen one.

609
00:45:57.966 --> 00:46:01.178
The fourth. The final sacrifice.

610
00:46:01.261 --> 00:46:04.598
It's going
to be you that breaks the world.

611
00:46:06.642 --> 00:46:08.268
Max? Can you hear me?

612
00:46:09.561 --> 00:46:10.561
Max!

613
00:46:10.979 --> 00:46:12.106
Max!

614
00:46:12.189 --> 00:46:13.189
He has her.

615
00:46:16.652 --> 00:46:17.945
Max.

616
00:46:18.779 --> 00:46:21.824
- Where are you going? Don't be scared.
- Stay away from me.

617
00:46:21.907 --> 00:46:23.951
Max. I thought you said you were ready.

618
00:46:25.202 --> 00:46:26.328
Ready to disappear!

619
00:46:27.246 --> 00:46:28.622
I said. stay away!

620
00:46:35.462 --> 00:46:37.339
Max. It's okay.

621
00:46:37.423 --> 00:46:38.757
I'm coming.

622
00:46:38.841 --> 00:46:40.968
I'm coming. Just hold
on a little longer.

623
00:47:00.654 --> 00:47:03.073
I dunno if you
can hear this. I'm sorry.

624
00:47:03.157 --> 00:47:04.783
I'm so. so sorry. Billy.

625
00:47:05.659 --> 00:47:07.870

- Mom?

626
00:47:07.953 --> 00:47:09.997

695
00:53:49.688 --> 00:53:51.481
He says they call it "the shadow."

697
00:53:54.484 --> 00:53:55.569

I think this answers your question. Jim.

700
00:54:24.598 --> 00:54:26.850

00:55:02.636 --> 00:55:03.803
It's okay.

705
00:55:04.304 --> 00:55:05.305
You got this.

706
00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:25.909
Shouldn't you be playing
with dolls or something?

707
00:55:25.992 --> 00:55:27.619
Shouldn't you bag your face?

708

710
00:55:44.094 --> 00:55:45.345
I found her.

711
00:55:47.847 --> 00:55:49.224
But she's young.

712
00:55:49.808 --> 00:55:51.393
She can't see me.

713
00:55:53.853 --> 00:55:55.480
Can't hear me.

What the hell is taking so long?

742
00:58:47.235 --> 00:58:51.030
- Let me go. you meathead!
- Shut your mouth or I'll break your arms.

743
00:58:51.114 --> 00:58:52.240
Hear me. you little shit?

744
00:58:59.581 --> 00:59:00.665
Shit.

745
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:04.043
Jason?

746
00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:05.962
You can't be here right now. man.

747
00:59:06.045 --> 00:59:07.964
- The hell have you done?
- Jason.

748
00:59:08.965 --> 00:59:10.508
You need to leave.

749
00:59:11.217 --> 00:59:12.927
Is this what you did to Chrissy?

750
00:59:13.011 --> 00:59:14.596
- Just listen. Jason.
- Hey.

751
00:59:14.679 --> 00:59:16.639
- You need to go. man.
- Hi. Can... Can you hear me?

752
00:59:16.723 --> 00:59:18.224
Jason. don't touch her.

753
00:59:18.308 --> 00:59:20.059
- I'm not messing around.
- Hey.

754
00:59:20.143 --> 00:59:21.311
- Please. just...
- Hear me?

755
00:59:21.394 --> 00:59:23.021
Hey. back up! Back up!

756
00:59:23.104 --> 00:59:24.397
Not another step.

757
00:59:24.481 --> 00:59:27.150
Wa... Wait. We... We
don't have to do this.

758
00:59:27.817 --> 00:59:29.777
- We don't have to do this.
- I hope you're right.

759
00:59:29.861 --> 00:59:32.238
- Wait.
- Is there anyone else in the house?

760
00:59:32.864 --> 00:59:35.200
No. No.

761
00:59:35.283 --> 00:59:36.451
Turn around.

762
00:59:37.410 --> 00:59:38.620
- What?
- Turn around!

763
00:59:38.703 --> 00:59:40.121
Okay. okay. Relax. relax.

764
00:59:40.205 --> 00:59:42.290
- And put down your flashlight.
- It's okay. Okay.

765
00:59:43.958 --> 00:59:45.293
And empty your pockets.

766
00:59:46.085 --> 00:59:48.379
- Empty your pockets!
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

767
00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:52.550
Okay.

768
00:59:54.302 --> 00:59:55.970
Now. this is what's gonna happen.

769
00:59:57.180 --> 00:59:59.599
I'm gonna back away to the
top of the stairs there.

770
01:00:00.266 --> 01:00:03.686
Then I'll watch as you wake her
up from whatever the hell this is.

771
01:00:06.022 --> 01:00:07.148
I can't.

772
01:00:10.026 --> 01:00:11.026
Jason.

773
01:00:11.778 --> 01:00:13.613
If I wake her too soon.

774
01:00:15.198 --> 01:00:16.950
we all die.

775
01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:18.700
No.

776
01:00:19.869 --> 01:00:22.622
You don't wake her up right
now. you die. Sinclair.

777
01:00:24.749 --> 01:00:25.749
Just you.

778
01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:39.180
- You shut off this fence. right?
- Yeah.

779
01:00:39.889 --> 01:00:41.849
Good. So you can turn it back on again.

780
01:00:42.475 --> 01:00:45.853
Jim. you wanna clue us in
on what you're thinking here.

781
01:00:45.937 --> 01:00:47.605
or are we supposed to read your mind?

782
01:00:47.689 --> 01:00:50.400
This pit was designed to trap monsters.

783
01:00:51.317 --> 01:00:53.319
We get 'em in here. we lock it up.

784
01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.072
we rain fire from above.

785
01:00:56.155 --> 01:00:59.325
and we hope to hell that gives
El and the kids an upper hand.

786
01:01:00.159 --> 01:01:01.202
Okay.

787
01:01:01.286 --> 01:01:02.370
I'm with ya.

788
01:01:02.453 --> 01:01:04.914
Except the whole. uh...

789
01:01:04.998 --> 01:01:06.874
... "getting them all in here" part.

790
01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.543
It's a hive mind.

791
01:01:09.294 --> 01:01:10.378
You draw one.

792
01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:12.338
you draw 'em all.

793
01:01:13.923 --> 01:01:16.634
- You're the grill master.
- Okay.

794
01:01:16.718 --> 01:01:19.554
And you. you're the jailer.
You get that fence turned on.

795
01:01:19.637 --> 01:01:22.890
And once they're all in here.
lock that door behind 'em.

796
01:01:23.474 --> 01:01:24.517
What about you?

797
01:01:25.727 --> 01:01:26.853
I'm the bait.

798
01:01:30.064 --> 01:01:32.775
That one there. See
him? In the laundry room?

799
01:01:33.943 --> 01:01:35.278
It's not far from here.

800
01:01:36.262 --> 01:01:37.322
He's all alone.

801
01:01:38.698 --> 01:01:39.824
He's our target.

802
01:01:44.996 --> 01:01:47.915
- No!
- Let's go!

803
01:01:47.999 --> 01:01:48.999
Hey.

804
01:01:51.252 --> 01:01:52.754
I'm gonna die someday.

805
01:01:53.463 --> 01:01:54.589
But not today.

806
01:01:56.215 --> 01:01:59.010
I still got a date to make. remember?

807
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:02.055
I don't know. Hop.

808
01:02:04.015 --> 01:02:05.016
This time.

809
01:02:06.225 --> 01:02:07.644
it's gonna be different.

810
01:02:09.687 --> 01:02:10.772
It better be.

811
01:02:11.898 --> 01:02:14.567
I am not having another funeral.

812
01:02:55.817 --> 01:02:57.110
Hey. dipshits!

813
01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:00.154
- Give up that easy. huh?
- Shh!

814
01:03:00.238 --> 01:03:01.489
Is that really necessary?

815
01:03:05.243 --> 01:03:06.744
They're on the roof.

816
01:03:10.289 --> 01:03:12.041
Shit. Shit. Shit.

817
01:03:12.125 --> 01:03:13.543
Shit. Shit. Shit.

818
01:03:30.393 --> 01:03:32.145
They can't get in
through there. can they?

819
01:03:37.567 --> 01:03:39.986
Die! Die!

820
01:03:42.447 --> 01:03:45.366
Die! Die! Die!

821
01:04:06.012 --> 01:04:07.012
Ugh.

822
01:04:13.144 --> 01:04:14.144
Easy.

823
01:04:51.749 --> 01:04:52.809
Steve!

824
01:04:52.809 --> 01:04:54.060
Nancy!

825
01:06:34.827 --> 01:06:35.953
Eddie!

826
01:06:36.037 --> 01:06:37.204
I need you!

827
01:06:37.288 --> 01:06:39.332
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

828
01:06:48.507 --> 01:06:50.635
Holy shit. Holy shit.

829
01:06:51.302 --> 01:06:52.803
- Nice.
- Thanks.

830
01:06:57.850 --> 01:06:59.018
Are there other vents?

831
01:07:00.019 --> 01:07:01.019
Oh. shit.

832
01:07:01.562 --> 01:07:03.981
- Shit!
- Shit. shit. shit. shit.

833
01:07:07.944 --> 01:07:08.945
Shit!

834
01:07:10.696 --> 01:07:12.114
Shit!

835
01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:21.415
That's not gonna hold!

836
01:07:21.499 --> 01:07:23.501
Let's go! Let's go!

837
01:07:25.628 --> 01:07:26.837
Come on! Quickly!

838
01:07:28.631 --> 01:07:29.757
Ah!

839
01:07:31.425 --> 01:07:32.718
Eddie. come on!

01:07:40.643 --> 01:07:42.311

Eddie. what are you doing?

849
01:08:12.883 --> 01:08:14.593

- No!

We call him Vecna.

877

He lives in another dimension.

878
01:10:32.690 --> 01:10:34.191
That's why you can't see him.

879
01:10:34.275 --> 01:10:36.861

01:10:37.695 --> 01:10:39.738

881
01:10:39.822 --> 01:10:42.366
No. no. you're not

- You expect me to believe that?
- It's the truth.

885
01:10:47.413 --> 01:10:50.291
- Then why was Chrissy at Eddie's trailer?
- She was buying drugs.

886
01:10:50.374 --> 01:10:51.374
Liar!

887
01:10:52.126 --> 01:10:54.086
Okay.

888
01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:55.170

01:10:55.713 --> 01:10:56.714
Chrissy...

890
01:10:57.673 --> 01:10:58.883
She was seeing things.

891
01:10:59.925 --> 01:11:01.135
Terrible things.

892
01:11:02.136 --> 01:11:04.221
Things Vecna forced her to see.

893
01:11:04.805 --> 01:11:06.724
- She was scared.
- No.

894
01:11:06.807 --> 01:11:08.100
She just needed help.

895
01:11:08.601 --> 01:11:10.186
That's how I know you're lying.

896
01:11:10.769 --> 01:11:11.770
If Chrissy was scared.

897
01:11:11.854 --> 01:11:14.815
if... if Chrissy wanted
help. she would've come to me!

898
01:11:15.399 --> 01:11:16.609
Not Eddie!

899
01:11:16.692 --> 01:11:18.027
Not that freak! Never!

900
01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:20.237
You're wrong about Eddie.

901
01:11:20.321 --> 01:11:21.321
No.

902
01:11:22.406 --> 01:11:23.866
But I was wrong about you.

903
01:11:23.949 --> 01:11:26.118
I never should've let you in the door.

904
01:11:27.661 --> 01:11:29.997
And I never should have knocked.

905
01:11:34.210 --> 01:11:36.212
I thought I wanted to be like you.

906
01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:40.382

01:11:42.843 --> 01:11:43.843
Normal.

908
01:11:44.845 --> 01:11:46.180
But it turns out.

909
01:11:46.805 --> 01:11:49.183
normal's just a raging psychopath.

910
01:11:49.266 --> 01:11:51.268
You have five seconds to wake her up.

911
01:11:53.938 --> 01:11:54.938
Four.

912
01:11:58.442 --> 01:11:59.610
Three.

913
01:12:02.905 --> 01:12:04.073
Hey! Hey!

914
01:12:05.824 --> 01:12:06.824
Crit hit!

915
01:12:11.747 --> 01:12:12.831
No! No!

916
01:12:39.191 --> 01:12:42.444
You are brave. Maxine.

917
01:12:44.446 --> 01:12:47.533
Much braver than your brother.

918
01:12:49.201 --> 01:12:50.786
But in the end...

919
01:12:52.871 --> 01:12:54.498
you are weak

920
01:12:55.124 --> 01:12:56.375
and fragile.

921
01:12:56.458 --> 01:12:58.794
just like him.

922
01:13:00.504 --> 01:13:02.840
Like all the rest of them.

923
01:13:05.801 --> 01:13:07.011
And you

924
01:13:07.845 --> 01:13:08.845
will

925
01:13:09.930 --> 01:13:11.181
break.

926
01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:20.250
You.

927
01:14:22.336 --> 01:14:23.336
Hi.

928
01:14:32.429 --> 01:14:36.308
Come get me. you sons of bitches!

929
01:14:51.198 --> 01:14:52.366
Screw it.

930
01:15:16.473 --> 01:15:18.308
I didn't know what to do. so I... I...

931
01:15:19.643 --> 01:15:20.686
I ran away.

932
01:15:21.937 --> 01:15:23.939
I just ran. and I left her there.

933
01:15:24.565 --> 01:15:26.567
I mean. look at us.

934
01:15:27.776 --> 01:15:29.445
We are not heroes.

935
01:15:59.516 --> 01:16:00.516
Shit!

936
01:16:39.056 --> 01:16:40.974
Max. are you okay?

937
01:16:41.458 --> 01:16:42.476
Huh?

938
01:16:42.476 --> 01:16:43.560
Are you okay?

939
01:16:43.644 --> 01:16:44.644
Yeah.

940
01:16:46.188 --> 01:16:47.231
Are you...

941
01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.608
Are you real?

942
01:16:50.442 --> 01:16:51.693
Di... Did I make you?

943
01:16:55.447 --> 01:16:56.447
I'm real.

944
01:16:57.658 --> 01:16:58.658
How?

945
01:16:59.076 --> 01:17:01.620
I piggybacked from a
pizza dough freezer.

946
01:17:03.455 --> 01:17:04.455
What?

947
01:17:04.456 --> 01:17:06.625
Uh...

948
01:17:35.195 --> 01:17:36.280
Stay back.

949
01:18:07.644 --> 01:18:09.396
If you touch her again.

950
01:18:11.148 --> 01:18:13.442
I will kill you again.

951
01:18:14.026 --> 01:18:15.944
Is that what you did?

952
01:18:16.445 --> 01:18:17.446
Hmm?

953
01:18:18.739 --> 01:18:20.449
Did you kill me?

954
01:18:21.742 --> 01:18:25.329
I am so glad

955
01:18:25.412 --> 01:18:27.956
you are here. Eleven.

956
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:30.125
This...

957
01:18:31.209 --> 01:18:33.462
is going to be

958
01:18:34.254 --> 01:18:35.505
beautiful.

959
01:18:41.303 --> 01:18:43.639
So beautiful.

960
01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:52.481
And it's all thanks to you.

961
01:19:09.665 --> 01:19:10.666
She's fighting him.

962
01:19:18.423 --> 01:19:20.258
Eddie!

963
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:22.761
Eddie!

964
01:19:25.097 --> 01:19:26.139
Eddie!

965
01:19:32.354 --> 01:19:33.522
Eddie!

966
01:19:52.165 --> 01:19:53.625
Come on!

967
01:20:59.232 --> 01:21:00.358
Before

968
01:21:01.151 --> 01:21:02.402
I kill you...

969
01:21:05.489 --> 01:21:07.365
... I want you to watch.

970
01:22:26.194 --> 01:22:27.821
Papa is dead.

971
01:22:42.127 --> 01:22:44.921
I know what he did to you.

972
01:22:45.005 --> 01:22:49.467
You were different.

973
01:22:51.344 --> 01:22:52.387
Like me.

974
01:22:55.265 --> 01:22:56.600
And he hurt you.

975
01:22:59.436 --> 01:23:00.520
He made you...

976
01:23:02.188 --> 01:23:03.273
into this.

977
01:23:06.484 --> 01:23:08.486
He is the monster. Henry.

978
01:23:09.738 --> 01:23:11.489
Not you.

979
01:23:12.991 --> 01:23:14.200
Not you.

980
01:23:18.204 --> 01:23:19.247
You're right.

981
01:23:21.249 --> 01:23:22.249
You

982
01:23:22.834 --> 01:23:23.960
and I.

983
01:23:24.878 --> 01:23:26.504
we are different.

984
01:23:27.714 --> 01:23:29.925
And Papa did hurt me.

985
01:23:31.384 --> 01:23:33.386
But he was no monster.

986
01:23:35.388 --> 01:23:37.223
He was just a man.

987
01:23:39.601 --> 01:23:43.563
An ordinary. mediocre man.

988
01:23:44.564 --> 01:23:47.567
That is why he sought
greatness in others.

989
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:50.278
In you.

990
01:23:51.446 --> 01:23:52.656
And me.

991
01:23:56.826 --> 01:23:57.826
Hmm.

992
01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.539
But in the end...

993
01:24:03.583 --> 01:24:06.002
he could not control us.

994
01:24:07.671 --> 01:24:09.965
He could not shape us.

995
01:24:11.216 --> 01:24:13.343
He could not change us.

996
01:24:14.636 --> 01:24:17.389
Do you not see. Eleven?

997
01:24:20.016 --> 01:24:22.394
He did not make me into this.

998
01:24:25.522 --> 01:24:26.940
You did.

999
01:24:37.951 --> 01:24:38.994
At first.

1000
01:24:39.869 --> 01:24:42.455
I believed you had sent me to my death.

1001
01:24:42.539 --> 01:24:44.124
To purgatory.

1002
01:24:45.333 --> 01:24:46.668
But I was wrong.

1003
01:24:48.128 --> 01:24:50.380
I was somewhere new.

1004
01:25:05.937 --> 01:25:08.565
I became an explorer.

1005
01:25:14.529 --> 01:25:16.489
An explorer of a realm

1006
01:25:16.573 --> 01:25:19.242
unspoiled by mankind.

1007
01:25:23.747 --> 01:25:25.749
I saw so many things.

1008
01:25:27.333 --> 01:25:28.460
And one day.

1009
01:25:29.961 --> 01:25:33.298
I found the most
extraordinary thing of all.

1010
01:25:37.969 --> 01:25:39.054
Something

1011
01:25:39.846 --> 01:25:43.058
that would change everything.

1012
01:25:46.352 --> 01:25:50.523
I saw a means to realize my potential.

1013
01:25:51.024 --> 01:25:53.902
To transcend my human form.

1014
01:25:54.611 --> 01:25:56.696
To become the predator

1015
01:25:56.780 --> 01:26:00.408
I was always born to be.

1016
01:26:46.246 --> 01:26:47.497
It was...

1017
01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:48.623
It was you.

1018
01:26:51.501 --> 01:26:52.710
Always you.

1019
01:26:55.213 --> 01:26:58.341
All I needed was
someone to open the door.

1020
01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:02.095
And you did that for me.

1021
01:27:03.888 --> 01:27:06.266
Without even realizing it.

1022
01:27:06.850 --> 01:27:07.850
Didn't you?

1023
01:27:15.483 --> 01:27:17.777
And when you did realize.

1024
01:27:18.903 --> 01:27:20.822
you chose to resist.

1025
01:27:26.911 --> 01:27:30.373
So I sought a means
to open my own doors.

1026
01:27:31.666 --> 01:27:32.792
I sought...

1027
01:27:36.004 --> 01:27:37.338
your power.

1028
01:27:39.257 --> 01:27:42.343
All this time. we've been building it.

1029
01:27:44.721 --> 01:27:45.721
For you.

1030
01:27:49.058 --> 01:27:50.727
So. don't you see?

1031
01:27:51.895 --> 01:27:53.188
Once again.

1032
01:27:54.272 --> 01:27:55.857
you have freed me.

1033
01:27:56.357 --> 01:27:57.357
No.

1034
01:27:57.734 --> 01:27:59.277
You don't have to do this.

1035
01:28:00.612 --> 01:28:02.530
You can still stop this.

1036
01:28:03.781 --> 01:28:05.450
It is over. Eleven.

1037
01:28:06.701 --> 01:28:08.244
Your friends

1038
01:28:08.828 --> 01:28:09.913
have lost.

1039
01:28:13.833 --> 01:28:14.918
No!

1040
01:28:25.845 --> 01:28:27.347
Eddie!

1041
01:28:29.807 --> 01:28:31.559
There is nothing...

1042
01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.562
nothing you can do

1043
01:28:35.188 --> 01:28:36.856
to stop this now.

1044
01:28:52.956 --> 01:28:56.292
Hawkins will burn and fall.

1045
01:28:56.376 --> 01:28:59.921
And the rest of this
senseless. broken world.

1046
01:29:00.004 --> 01:29:02.465
And I will be there.

1047
01:29:02.548 --> 01:29:03.883
Lucas!

1048
01:29:04.759 --> 01:29:08.429
I will be there to pick
up the pieces when it does.

1049
01:29:08.513 --> 01:29:09.555
Lucas!

1050
01:29:13.434 --> 01:29:17.772
And remake it into
something... beautiful.

1051
01:29:24.112 --> 01:29:25.697
There was a time

1052
01:29:26.698 --> 01:29:29.701
when I had hoped to have you by my side.

1053
01:29:33.371 --> 01:29:35.373
But now I just want you to watch.

1054
01:30:09.032 --> 01:30:10.616
Don't be afraid.

1055
01:30:12.827 --> 01:30:15.455
Try and stay very still.

1056
01:30:16.205 --> 01:30:17.205
No.

1057
01:30:17.665 --> 01:30:21.252
It will all be over soon.

1058
01:30:24.505 --> 01:30:26.924
Max!

1059
01:30:48.446 --> 01:30:50.156
El! El. can you hear me?

1060
01:30:50.239 --> 01:30:52.408
El. come on. Wake up! Wake up. El!

1061
01:30:52.492 --> 01:30:54.494
- Wake up! El!
- She can't breathe.

1062
01:30:54.577 --> 01:30:56.704
El. get outta there!

1063
01:30:56.788 --> 01:30:59.457
God. El! Wake up! Wake up!

1064
01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:00.792
Help me! Help me!

1065
01:31:02.168 --> 01:31:04.045
On the table. Get her on the table.

1066
01:31:08.007 --> 01:31:09.384
El. can you hear me?

1067
01:31:09.467 --> 01:31:11.386
El! El!

1068
01:31:11.886 --> 01:31:13.221
Can you hear me?

1069
01:31:13.304 --> 01:31:14.806
El! El!

1070
01:31:15.306 --> 01:31:16.307
El!

1071
01:31:18.935 --> 01:31:20.520
Mike.

1072
01:31:20.603 --> 01:31:23.022
Don't stop. Okay? You're the heart.

1073
01:31:23.106 --> 01:31:24.148
Okay? Remember that.

1074
01:31:24.716 --> 01:31:25.775
You're the heart.

1075
01:31:30.947 --> 01:31:31.948
El?

1076
01:31:32.031 --> 01:31:34.951
I don't know if you can hear
this. but... but if you can.

1077
01:31:35.034 --> 01:31:37.412
I want you to know I'm here. okay?

1078
01:31:37.495 --> 01:31:38.871
I'm right here.

1079
01:31:38.955 --> 01:31:39.955
And...

1080
01:31:41.499 --> 01:31:42.499
I love you.

1081
01:31:45.211 --> 01:31:46.963
El. do you hear me?

1082
01:31:47.463 --> 01:31:48.673
I love you.

1083
01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:50.883
I'm sorry I don't say it more.

1084
01:31:50.967 --> 01:31:53.052
I... It's not because I'm scared of you.

1085
01:31:53.594 --> 01:31:54.720
I'm not.

1086
01:31:54.804 --> 01:31:56.055
I've never felt that way.

1087
01:31:56.139 --> 01:31:57.139
Never.

1088
01:31:57.682 --> 01:31:59.183
But I am scared that one day

1089
01:31:59.267 --> 01:32:01.185
you'll realize you
don't need me anymore.

1090
01:32:01.269 --> 01:32:04.522
And I thought if I said how I
felt. it would somehow make that day

1091
01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:06.440
hurt more.

1092
01:32:08.359 --> 01:32:11.487
But the truth is. El. I don't
know how to live without you.

1093
01:32:12.363 --> 01:32:15.199
I feel like my life started that
day we found you in the woods.

1094
01:32:16.742 --> 01:32:19.829
You were wearing that yellow
Benny's Burgers T-shirt.

1095
01:32:20.329 --> 01:32:22.415
And it was so big. it
almost swallowed you whole.

1096
01:32:24.333 --> 01:32:25.477
And I knew right then and there.

1097
01:32:25.478 --> 01:32:27.587
in that moment. that I loved you.

1098
01:32:28.796 --> 01:32:31.048
And I've loved you every day since.

1099
01:32:32.258 --> 01:32:33.718
I love you on your good days.

1100
01:32:34.469 --> 01:32:35.928
I love you on your bad days.

1101
01:32:36.012 --> 01:32:38.639
I love you with your
powers. without your powers.

1102
01:32:38.723 --> 01:32:41.476
I love you for exactly who you are.

1103
01:32:42.393 --> 01:32:43.728
You're my superhero.

1104
01:32:44.979 --> 01:32:45.979
And...

1105
01:32:47.648 --> 01:32:48.900
I can't lose you.

1106
01:32:49.734 --> 01:32:52.278
Okay? Do you hear me? I can't lose you.

1107
01:32:52.987 --> 01:32:54.113
You can do anything.

1108
01:32:54.197 --> 01:32:56.115
You can fly. You can move mountains.

1109
01:32:56.199 --> 01:32:58.367
I believe that. I really do.

1110
01:32:59.035 --> 01:33:00.077
But right now.

1111
01:33:00.953 --> 01:33:02.330
you just have to fight.

1112
01:33:02.413 --> 01:33:03.413
Okay?

1113
01:33:04.290 --> 01:33:05.291
El.

1114
01:33:05.374 --> 01:33:06.374
Do you hear me?

1115
01:33:06.834 --> 01:33:08.836
You need to fight!

1116
01:33:10.796 --> 01:33:12.131
You have to fight.

1117
01:33:14.008 --> 01:33:15.343
Fight!

1118
01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:18.304
Fight!

1119
01:33:27.063 --> 01:33:28.272
That's it. El.

1120
01:33:28.356 --> 01:33:29.356
Fight. El.

1121
01:33:29.357 --> 01:33:30.357
Fight.

1122
01:33:32.026 --> 01:33:33.026
Fight!

1123
01:34:07.728 --> 01:34:09.313
Eddie!

1124
01:34:15.778 --> 01:34:17.738
Max!

1125
01:34:17.822 --> 01:34:19.115
Fight!

1126
01:35:00.448 --> 01:35:03.326
Joyce!

1127
01:35:03.326 --> 01:35:04.327
Hop!

1128
01:35:27.224 --> 01:35:29.560
Hey. assholes!

1129
01:35:57.463 --> 01:35:59.757
Yeah!

1130
01:36:27.743 --> 01:36:29.620
I don't believe in a higher power

1131
01:36:30.121 --> 01:36:31.789
or divine intervention.

1132
01:36:32.415 --> 01:36:33.833
But that was a miracle.

1133
01:36:37.586 --> 01:36:39.255
Then we better not waste it.

1134
01:36:41.549 --> 01:36:42.550
Phase four.

1135
01:36:43.217 --> 01:36:44.217
Flambé.

1136
01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:12.973
You and your friends

1137
01:38:13.057 --> 01:38:15.142
believe you have won.

1138
01:38:15.893 --> 01:38:17.520
Don't you?

1139
01:38:21.982 --> 01:38:23.234
But this

1140
01:38:23.317 --> 01:38:25.486
is only the beginning.

1141
01:38:26.487 --> 01:38:29.657
The beginning of the end.

1142
01:38:38.123 --> 01:38:41.877
You have already lost.

1143
01:38:42.962 --> 01:38:43.962
No.

1144
01:38:46.757 --> 01:38:47.883

Oh God. Eddie.

1184
01:42:30.230 --> 01:42:31.273
Bad. huh?

1185
01:42:31.356 --> 01:42:32.441
No. You're gonna be fine.

1186
01:42:32.524 --> 01:42:34.860
- Just gotta get you to a hospital. okay?
- Okay.

1187
01:42:34.943 --> 01:42:36.945
- All right. All right.
- I think...

1188
01:42:37.029 --> 01:42:38.029
Come on.

1189
01:42:38.030 --> 01:42:40.616
I think I just... I think
I just need a second. okay?

1190
01:42:40.699 --> 01:42:41.700
Okay.

1191
01:42:49.166 --> 01:42:51.668
I didn't run away this time. right?

1192
01:42:53.212 --> 01:42:54.338
No. No. No. No.

1193
01:42:54.922 --> 01:42:55.922
You didn't run.

1194
01:42:56.673 --> 01:42:59.676
You're gonna have to look after
those little sheep for me. okay?

1195
01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:01.345
No. you're gonna do that yourself.

1196
01:43:01.428 --> 01:43:02.513
Nah. man.

1197
01:43:03.013 --> 01:43:05.474
Say. "I'm gonna look after them."

1198
01:43:07.309 --> 01:43:08.352
Say it.

1199
01:43:10.354 --> 01:43:11.480
I'm...

1200
01:43:11.563 --> 01:43:12.898
I'm gonna look after...

1201
01:43:14.733 --> 01:43:15.733
Good.

1202
01:43:16.819 --> 01:43:19.446
'Cause I'm actually gonna graduate.

1203
01:43:23.909 --> 01:43:26.161
I think it's my year. Henderson.

1204
01:43:27.496 --> 01:43:30.749
I think it's finally my year.

1205
01:43:34.461 --> 01:43:35.838
I love you. man.

1206
01:43:38.757 --> 01:43:40.425
I love you too.

1207
01:43:44.805 --> 01:43:45.931
Eddie...

1208
01:43:47.766 --> 01:43:48.766
Eddie?

1209
01:43:49.334 --> 01:43:50.352
Eddie?

1210
01:43:53.814 --> 01:43:54.857
Eddie!

1211
01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:56.108
Come on.

1212
01:43:58.402 --> 01:43:59.528
Eddie!

1213
01:44:18.046 --> 01:44:19.046
Lucas!

1214
01:44:20.132 --> 01:44:21.258
We need a doctor!

1215
01:44:21.884 --> 01:44:23.177
Call an ambulance!

1216
01:44:23.260 --> 01:44:24.845
Hurry! Call an ambulance!

1217
01:44:26.221 --> 01:44:28.348
- Lucas...
- Yes. yes I'm here. I'm here.

1218
01:44:28.432 --> 01:44:32.561
I... I can't feel
or... ... see anything.

1219
01:44:32.644 --> 01:44:34.188
I know. I know. It's okay.

1220
01:44:34.771 --> 01:44:36.440
We're gonna get you help. okay?

1221
01:44:36.523 --> 01:44:37.816
Just... Just hold on.

1222
01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:40.903
Lucas. I'm scared. I'm
so scared. I'm so scared.

1223
01:44:40.986 --> 01:44:43.238
I know. I know. I know.

1224
01:44:43.322 --> 01:44:45.199
I don't wanna die. I'm not ready.

1225
01:44:45.282 --> 01:44:46.825
You're not gonna die. Hang on.

1226
01:44:46.909 --> 01:44:48.619
I don't wanna go! I'm not ready.

1227
01:44:48.702 --> 01:44:50.037
You're not gonna die!

1228
01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:52.122
Just... Just hang on!

1229
01:44:52.956 --> 01:44:54.291
Max. Max! Max!

1230
01:44:54.374 --> 01:44:56.835
No. no. no. Max. Stay with me.

1231
01:44:56.919 --> 01:44:58.795
- No.
- Stay with me! Don't go. Max.

1232
01:44:58.879 --> 01:45:00.881
Max. stay with me.

1233
01:45:00.964 --> 01:45:03.133
Just look at me. Max. Max. look.

1234
01:45:03.217 --> 01:45:05.010
No. Stay with me. Max.

1235
01:45:05.093 --> 01:45:06.762
Hang on. Just hang on.

1236
01:45:08.138 --> 01:45:09.932
Erica. help!

1237
01:45:18.273 --> 01:45:19.273
Max?

1238
01:45:19.983 --> 01:45:21.610
Max? Max? Max?

1239
01:45:21.693 --> 01:45:22.694
Max. stay with me.

1240
01:45:23.612 --> 01:45:24.863
Max. stay with me.

1241
01:45:24.947 --> 01:45:26.031
No! No!

1242
01:45:26.114 --> 01:45:27.824
Max! Max! Please. stay with me!

1243
01:45:28.659 --> 01:45:29.993
No!

1244
01:45:40.170 --> 01:45:42.172
Max!

1245
01:45:44.174 --> 01:45:45.467
Max!

1246
01:46:05.821 --> 01:46:06.822
Four chimes.

1247
01:46:07.572 --> 01:46:08.572
Max.

1248
01:47:04.838 --> 01:47:06.715
Holly! Holly!

1249
01:47:49.549 --> 01:47:50.549
Come on.

1250
01:47:51.009 --> 01:47:52.009
Come on.

1251
01:47:53.261 --> 01:47:55.263
Come on. I know you're in there.

1252
01:47:56.348 --> 01:47:57.974
I know you're in there. Wake up.

1253
01:47:58.058 --> 01:47:59.058
Wake up.

1254
01:47:59.059 --> 01:48:00.185
Wake up.

1255
01:48:25.335 --> 01:48:26.335
No.

1256
01:48:30.715 --> 01:48:31.800
You're not going.

1257
01:48:35.512 --> 01:48:36.512
No.

1258
01:48:58.226 --> 01:48:59.244
Hi.

1259
01:48:59.244 --> 01:49:00.370
Hi... ?

1260
01:49:01.079 --> 01:49:04.040
Max wanted to have a sleepover.

1261
01:49:05.125 --> 01:49:06.334
Which one?

1262
01:49:06.418 --> 01:49:07.502
This is Wonder Woman.

1263
01:49:07.586 --> 01:49:08.962
AKA Princess Diana.

1264
01:49:09.588 --> 01:49:10.672
Not Hopper.

1265
01:49:11.506 --> 01:49:12.507
Not Mike.

1266
01:49:12.591 --> 01:49:13.591
You.

1267
01:49:19.139 --> 01:49:20.432
Holy shit. This is insane.

1268
01:49:21.141 --> 01:49:22.476
Is this really gonna work?

1269
01:49:23.226 --> 01:49:24.352
See? What'd I tell you?

1270
01:49:24.936 --> 01:49:27.105
There's more to life than stupid boys.

1271
01:49:28.148 --> 01:49:29.691
Against the rules?

1272
01:49:29.774 --> 01:49:30.942
We make our own rules.

1273
01:50:28.583 --> 01:50:30.438
It's been less than 48 hours

1274
01:50:30.439 --> 01:50:32.963
since a 7.4 magnitude earthquake

1275
01:50:33.046 --> 01:50:37.384
rocked the quaint town of Hawkins.
80 miles outside of Indianapolis.

1276
01:50:37.467 --> 01:50:39.886
in an event that
seismologists are calling

1277
01:50:39.970 --> 01:50:43.431
"a natural disaster of
near-unprecedented scale."

1278
01:50:43.974 --> 01:50:46.351
The death toll now stands at 22.

1279
01:50:46.434 --> 01:50:49.062
But with hundreds more
filling Roane County hospitals

1280
01:50:49.145 --> 01:50:50.730
and many more still missing.

1281
01:50:51.231 --> 01:50:53.650
officials expect those numbers to rise.

1282
01:51:03.410 --> 01:51:06.621
Go! This way! This way! Let's go!

1283
01:51:16.464 --> 01:51:18.435
This is only the latest tragedy

1284
01:51:18.436 --> 01:51:20.802
to befall this once-safe town.

1285
01:51:20.885 --> 01:51:24.014
Most recently. a string of
high school students were killed

1286
01:51:24.097 --> 01:51:25.849
in a series of ritualistic murders.

1287
01:51:25.932 --> 01:51:28.351
which have been linked
to a local satanic cult

1288
01:51:28.435 --> 01:51:30.604
known as "Hellfire."

1289
01:51:30.687 --> 01:51:34.399
Eddie Munson. the leader of this
cult and prime suspect in the murders.

1290
01:51:34.482 --> 01:51:37.861
has been missing since the
earthquake and is presumed dead.

1291
01:51:38.361 --> 01:51:41.323
But this offers little comfort
to the people of Hawkins.

1292
01:51:41.406 --> 01:51:45.118
who are scared. angry.
and searching for answers.

1293
01:51:45.201 --> 01:51:48.872
Why their town? What have they
done to deserve so much suffering?

1294
01:51:49.456 --> 01:51:53.001
A growing chorus believes the
two recent tragedies are linked.

1295
01:51:53.084 --> 01:51:56.338
claiming the Munson murders
opened a doorway between worlds.

1296
01:51:56.421 --> 01:52:00.258
A doorway. they say. into hell itself.

1297
01:52:01.301 --> 01:52:02.594
Are you hearing this?

1298
01:52:03.136 --> 01:52:06.222
They're now calling
it a doorway into hell.

1299
01:52:06.306 --> 01:52:08.933
Great. More hysteria. Just what we need.

1300
01:52:09.017 --> 01:52:10.810
Well. it's the news.

1301
01:52:10.894 --> 01:52:14.064
Now indistinguishable from the tabloids.

1302
01:52:16.107 --> 01:52:17.107
Hey. Nance!

1303
01:52:17.609 --> 01:52:20.028
I found some more of your
old stuff in the attic.

1304
01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:24.783
Mr. Rabbit.

1305
01:52:24.866 --> 01:52:26.743
It's okay if you wanna
save him. you know?

1306
01:52:27.369 --> 01:52:29.371
No. he'll be more loved in a new home.

1307
01:52:32.499 --> 01:52:34.209
- Someone order a pizza?
- Pizza?

1308
01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:07.867
Mom!

1309
01:53:07.951 --> 01:53:08.952
Hey!

1310
01:53:14.457 --> 01:53:16.710
You are never going on
vacation again. you hear me?

1311
01:53:16.793 --> 01:53:19.003
In fact. you can forget about college.

1312
01:53:19.087 --> 01:53:21.339
You are staying right here.

1313
01:53:22.590 --> 01:53:23.633
Are you okay?

1314
01:53:23.717 --> 01:53:24.801
Yeah.

1315
01:53:24.884 --> 01:53:25.969
Yeah. I'm okay.

1316
01:53:27.137 --> 01:53:28.221
But. Jonathan...

1317
01:53:28.304 --> 01:53:29.639
This isn't an earthquake.

1318
01:53:30.265 --> 01:53:31.265
I know.

1319
01:53:31.933 --> 01:53:33.643
I know a lot more than you think.

1320
01:53:34.352 --> 01:53:35.352
How?

1321
01:53:36.146 --> 01:53:38.356
- We've been trying to call you...
- I know.

1322
01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:39.691
I know. I'm sorry.

1323
01:53:40.275 --> 01:53:41.860
We just couldn't risk contact.

1324
01:53:42.527 --> 01:53:44.529
"We couldn't risk contact"?

1325
01:53:44.612 --> 01:53:47.449
Hey. hey. I'll tell
you everything. okay?

1326
01:53:47.532 --> 01:53:48.825
- Okay.
- I promise.

1327
01:53:49.743 --> 01:53:50.744
But. for now.

1328
01:53:51.745 --> 01:53:53.079
I'm just glad you're safe.

1329
01:54:00.253 --> 01:54:01.337
Where's Lucas?

1330
01:54:01.921 --> 01:54:03.173
He's at the hospital.

1331
01:54:03.757 --> 01:54:04.758
Was he hurt?

1332
01:54:05.467 --> 01:54:06.676
No. No. he's...

1333
01:54:09.846 --> 01:54:10.846
Oh God.

1334
01:54:11.848 --> 01:54:12.848
You don't know.

1335
01:54:18.396 --> 01:54:23.067
"He opened his eyes. and further
words died in his throat."

1336
01:54:23.151 --> 01:54:27.197
"He forgot about the need to sick
up that horrible parody of wine."

1337
01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:29.032
"He forgot about his mother.

1338
01:54:29.115 --> 01:54:31.493
and Uncle Morgan. and his father.

1339
01:54:31.576 --> 01:54:33.369
and almost everything else."

1340
01:54:33.453 --> 01:54:34.954
"Speedy was gone."

1341
01:54:35.038 --> 01:54:38.374
"The graceful arcs of the roller
coaster against the sky were gone."

1342
01:54:38.458 --> 01:54:41.711
"He could feel the hair
stirring on the nape of his neck.

1343
01:54:41.795 --> 01:54:45.381
could feel a goofed-up grin pulling
at the corners of his mouth."

1344
01:54:45.465 --> 01:54:48.009
"Speedy! I'm here. my God!"

1345
01:54:48.092 --> 01:54:49.928
"I'm here in the territories!"

1346
01:54:59.187 --> 01:55:00.605
Oh my God.

1347
01:55:03.608 --> 01:55:06.027
- We've been calling you guys like crazy.
- I know.

1348
01:55:06.528 --> 01:55:07.946
We came as soon as we heard.

1349
01:55:19.374 --> 01:55:20.375
I'm sorry.

1350
01:55:53.366 --> 01:55:54.367
Do they know...

1351
01:55:56.536 --> 01:55:57.745
when she will wake?

1352
01:56:00.415 --> 01:56:01.416
No.

1353
01:56:03.126 --> 01:56:04.502
They say she might not.

1354
01:56:09.591 --> 01:56:11.050
Her heart stopped.

1355
01:56:11.634 --> 01:56:13.094
For over a minute.

1356
01:56:16.681 --> 01:56:17.724
She died.

1357
01:56:20.685 --> 01:56:22.812
I... I mean. clinically. but...

1358
01:56:23.688 --> 01:56:24.981
then she came back.

1359
01:56:28.860 --> 01:56:30.862
The doctors don't know how.

1360
01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:35.408
They say it's a miracle.

1361
01:57:00.224 --> 01:57:01.809
I'm here. Max.

1362
01:58:08.209 --> 01:58:09.377
- Hi.
- Hi.

1363
01:58:09.877 --> 01:58:12.880
Uh. so these are blankets and sheets.

1364
01:58:12.964 --> 01:58:16.384
And some... some clothes
and... and some kids' toys.

1365
01:58:16.467 --> 01:58:18.803
Wow. It's already so organized.

1366
01:58:18.886 --> 01:58:19.887
We appreciate that.

1367
01:58:19.971 --> 01:58:21.973
- Do you want a tax receipt for it?
- Um...

1368
01:58:22.682 --> 01:58:25.393
No. I don't think that we
need one. Thank you. though.

1369
01:58:26.686 --> 01:58:30.440
But is there anything else
that we can do to help?

1370
01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:36.279
Okay. then we sort by age.

1371
01:58:36.362 --> 01:58:40.658
We've got infants.
girls. boys. men. women...

1372
01:58:40.742 --> 01:58:46.039
Oh. if anything is in too bad
shape. we really don't want that.

1373
01:58:48.541 --> 01:58:51.294
I found another jar of peanut
butter. and it's crunchy...

1374
01:58:52.570 --> 01:58:53.588
Robin.

1375
01:58:53.588 --> 01:58:54.672
Hi.

1376
01:58:54.756 --> 01:58:57.175
- What are you doing here?
- I am...

1377
01:58:57.675 --> 01:58:59.802
I... I am making PB&Js.

1378
01:58:59.886 --> 01:59:01.721
Right. yeah. No. Duh. Of course.

1379
01:59:01.804 --> 01:59:04.932
Uh. I... I am also making
PB&Js. as it so happens.

1380
01:59:06.350 --> 01:59:07.351
Cool.

1381
01:59:17.278 --> 01:59:20.239
Hey. uh. I... I'm sorry
if that came out weird.

1382
01:59:20.323 --> 01:59:22.575
I didn't mean it like.
"What are you doing here?"

1383
01:59:22.658 --> 01:59:23.915
I just meant. "What are you doing here?"

1384
01:59:23.916 --> 01:59:26.412
Like. "Nice surprise. Great to see you."

1385
01:59:26.496 --> 01:59:27.496
Uh...

1386
01:59:27.497 --> 01:59:29.874
- I didn't take it as anything negative.
- Okay. good. Good.

1387
01:59:29.957 --> 01:59:32.668
No. I... I'm sorry. My brain's
been a little frazzled lately.

1388
01:59:32.752 --> 01:59:34.212
- 'Cause...
- Of everything?

1389
01:59:34.879 --> 01:59:36.214
Yeah.

1390
01:59:36.297 --> 01:59:37.673
Yeah. and Dan.

1391
01:59:38.174 --> 01:59:39.675
Um. he's my boyfriend.

1392
01:59:39.759 --> 01:59:41.636
Well. was my boyfriend.

1393
01:59:41.719 --> 01:59:43.513
He was visiting. took one look at this.

1394
01:59:43.596 --> 01:59:46.099
and it's not what he was
envisioning for spring break.

1395
01:59:46.182 --> 01:59:48.559
He was like. "I'm outta here.
Back to Purdue. Good luck."

1396
01:59:48.643 --> 01:59:51.345
Which. ultimately. it's
bordering on a good thing.

1397
01:59:51.346 --> 01:59:52.522
'cause he was grating on me.

1398
01:59:52.605 --> 01:59:55.441
He is the type who trashes Fast
Times 'cause it has no plot.

1399
01:59:55.525 --> 01:59:58.027
I should've just ended
things right there and then.

1400
02:00:00.071 --> 02:00:01.155
Sorry.

1401
02:00:02.056 --> 02:00:03.074
I'm so sorry.

1402
02:00:03.074 --> 02:00:05.456
I am rambling about my dumb boyfriend

1403
02:00:05.457 --> 02:00:07.036
when there are people
out there suffering.

1404
02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:09.580
Who need... food.

1405
02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:15.378
And I have just made a peanut
butter on peanut butter monstrosity.

1406
02:00:17.672 --> 02:00:18.672
Um...

1407
02:00:25.847 --> 02:00:27.640
I don't know what's wrong with me.

1408
02:00:27.723 --> 02:00:31.435
Um. it's like sometimes my mouth
is moving faster than my brain.

1409
02:00:31.519 --> 02:00:33.187
and it's like this runaway train.

1410
02:00:33.271 --> 02:00:36.357
and I cannot seem to get it to
stop. no matter how hard I try.

1411
02:00:37.275 --> 02:00:38.526
You know what I mean?

1412
02:00:38.609 --> 02:00:41.779
Uh. yeah. I think I know what you mean.

1413
02:00:44.407 --> 02:00:45.491
It's a gift.

1414
02:00:45.575 --> 02:00:47.493
- Oh. for me?
- You're welcome. Mm-hmm.

1415
02:00:47.577 --> 02:00:49.704
- You really shouldn't have.
- Oh. but I did.

1416
02:00:49.787 --> 02:00:52.039
- I just don't even deserve it.
- But I did.

1417
02:00:52.123 --> 02:00:54.458
- I mean. thank you.
- Early birthday.

1418
02:00:54.542 --> 02:00:57.420
Thank you so much. Oh. oh. wow.

1419
02:00:59.714 --> 02:01:00.840
H2O?

1420
02:01:01.883 --> 02:01:03.467
Vital for all forms of life.

1421
02:01:18.524 --> 02:01:19.692
Mr. Munson?

1422
02:01:25.907 --> 02:01:27.533
I'm Dustin Henderson.

1423
02:01:27.617 --> 02:01:28.868
Can we talk?

1424
02:01:29.952 --> 02:01:32.455
I can't imagine we got
anything to talk about.

1425
02:01:34.081 --> 02:01:35.416
My nephew is innocent.

1426
02:01:36.542 --> 02:01:37.710
He's still missing.

1427
02:01:38.711 --> 02:01:41.172
I'll put up as many posters
as I need until he's found.

1428
02:01:43.049 --> 02:01:44.091
Good day to you.

1429
02:01:44.759 --> 02:01:45.801
I was with him.

1430
02:01:50.681 --> 02:01:52.516
I was with him when the earthquake hit.

1431
02:01:56.646 --> 02:01:58.981
And... where is Eddie now?

1432
02:02:14.872 --> 02:02:16.040
I'm...

1433
02:02:16.916 --> 02:02:18.125
I'm so sorry.

1434
02:02:52.994 --> 02:02:55.288
I wish everyone had gotten to know him.

1435
02:02:57.999 --> 02:02:59.166
Really know him.

1436
02:03:01.585 --> 02:03:03.421
Because they would've loved him.

1437
02:03:04.005 --> 02:03:05.005
Mr. Munson.

1438
02:03:06.716 --> 02:03:07.925
They would've loved him.

1439
02:03:10.219 --> 02:03:11.304
Even in the end...

1440
02:03:13.306 --> 02:03:15.558
he never stopped being Eddie.

1441
02:03:18.352 --> 02:03:20.354
Despite everything.

1442
02:03:22.898 --> 02:03:24.900
I never even saw him get mad.

1443
02:03:26.319 --> 02:03:27.486
He could've run.

1444
02:03:28.696 --> 02:03:30.906
He could've saved himself.

1445
02:03:33.326 --> 02:03:34.410
But he fought.

1446
02:03:36.495 --> 02:03:40.666
He fought and died to protect this town.

1447
02:03:41.625 --> 02:03:44.879
This town that... hated him.

1448
02:03:46.547 --> 02:03:48.215
He isn't just innocent...

1449
02:03:50.176 --> 02:03:51.427
Mr. Munson. he's...

1450
02:03:53.304 --> 02:03:54.597
he's a hero.

1451
02:04:47.858 --> 02:04:49.110
Oh Jesus.

1452
02:04:51.779 --> 02:04:52.822
Holy shit.

1453
02:04:54.073 --> 02:04:55.908
This place is a total disaster.

1454
02:04:56.409 --> 02:04:57.409
Yeah.

1455
02:04:58.285 --> 02:05:00.037
Well. that's a bit of a problem.

1456
02:05:00.121 --> 02:05:02.289
I get we gotta hide Supergirl.

1457
02:05:02.373 --> 02:05:05.584
but this isn't exactly the
Fortress of Solitude. man.

1458
02:05:05.668 --> 02:05:08.421
It's more like a fortress of grodiness.

1459
02:05:08.504 --> 02:05:10.464
Come on. guys. seriously.

1460
02:05:10.548 --> 02:05:12.675
I've seen Mike's room
look worse than this.

1461
02:05:12.758 --> 02:05:14.093
Ah. brutal. dude.

1462
02:05:14.176 --> 02:05:15.845
Ah! See?

1463
02:05:15.928 --> 02:05:17.221
Water still works.

1464
02:05:21.142 --> 02:05:23.060
And. voilà. Cleaning supplies.

1465
02:05:37.324 --> 02:05:39.034
All right. That's good.

1466
02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:40.911
Hold it right there.

1467
02:05:48.043 --> 02:05:50.212
What's he doing?

1468
02:05:53.299 --> 02:05:55.885
Looks like he's gathering mushrooms.

1469
02:05:55.968 --> 02:05:57.761
He's a little on the eccentric side.

1470
02:05:57.845 --> 02:05:59.472
Welcome to the club. right?

1471
02:05:59.555 --> 02:06:01.098
Yeah. welcome to the club.

1472
02:06:07.313 --> 02:06:08.731
Hey. Nancy?

1473
02:06:08.814 --> 02:06:09.814
Yeah?

1474
02:06:10.316 --> 02:06:11.734
I'm sorry I wasn't here.

1475
02:06:12.526 --> 02:06:14.028
Oh. I mean...

1476
02:06:15.571 --> 02:06:17.239
to be honest. I'm
kinda glad you weren't.

1477
02:06:19.658 --> 02:06:22.328
I just mean. I'm glad
you were with Mike.

1478
02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:23.870
And Will.

1479
02:06:23.871 --> 02:06:26.707
And I'm... I'm glad you were here too.

1480
02:06:27.708 --> 02:06:29.168
Otherwise. who'd have been in charge?

1481
02:06:29.960 --> 02:06:31.378
Steve?

1482
02:06:32.087 --> 02:06:36.091
He's actually grown up
quite a bit. you know?

1483
02:06:38.135 --> 02:06:39.136
Yeah.

1484
02:06:39.220 --> 02:06:40.220
Yeah. I'm sure.

1485
02:06:43.849 --> 02:06:44.849
Hey.

1486
02:06:46.519 --> 02:06:47.519
Yeah?

1487
02:06:48.521 --> 02:06:49.521
Are we okay?

1488
02:06:52.024 --> 02:06:53.024
Yeah.

1489
02:06:53.442 --> 02:06:54.860
- Yeah?
- Yeah. totally.

1490
02:06:55.611 --> 02:06:56.862
Yeah. it's... it's just...

1491
02:06:58.614 --> 02:06:59.615
You know. it's hard.

1492
02:07:00.658 --> 02:07:01.784
I feel like

1493
02:07:01.867 --> 02:07:04.370
life keeps throwing things
in the way of our big plans.

1494
02:07:06.705 --> 02:07:08.082
Yeah. sure seems like that.

1495
02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.853
You think it's too late to throw

1496
02:07:11.854 --> 02:07:14.088
"saving the world" on
your college résumé?

1497
02:07:18.509 --> 02:07:20.511
Your... Your application letter...

1498
02:07:21.637 --> 02:07:24.223
Not that it matters
at all anymore. but...

1499
02:07:25.432 --> 02:07:26.684
did it ever come?

1500
02:07:30.646 --> 02:07:32.523
No. No. uh...

1501
02:07:33.607 --> 02:07:34.607
Not yet.

1502
02:07:53.335 --> 02:07:55.796
Did she... talk to you at all?

1503
02:07:56.630 --> 02:07:57.715
Not much.

1504
02:07:57.798 --> 02:07:59.425
I mean. a little bit.

1505
02:08:02.219 --> 02:08:03.219
Dr. Brenner.

1506
02:08:06.849 --> 02:08:08.684
He says that she wasn't ready.

1507
02:08:09.184 --> 02:08:11.061
And now she's starting
to think he was right.

1508
02:08:11.145 --> 02:08:12.396
That's crap.

1509
02:08:12.896 --> 02:08:14.898
If it wasn't for her. if
she hadn't left the lab.

1510
02:08:14.982 --> 02:08:16.567
- Max wouldn't be alive right now.
- I know.

1511
02:08:17.901 --> 02:08:19.111
It's just. she's. um...

1512
02:08:20.112 --> 02:08:21.572
She's never lost before.

1513
02:08:22.156 --> 02:08:23.198
Not like this.

1514
02:08:23.824 --> 02:08:26.035
- She'll have another chance.
- Let's hope not.

1515
02:08:26.118 --> 02:08:29.288
Let's hope One is dead and rotting.

1516
02:08:30.331 --> 02:08:31.331
He's not.

1517
02:08:34.543 --> 02:08:38.047
Now that I'm here. in Hawkins.

1518
02:08:38.922 --> 02:08:40.924
I can feel him.

1519
02:08:41.967 --> 02:08:43.385
And he's hurt.

1520
02:08:43.469 --> 02:08:44.678
He's hurting.

1521
02:08:46.055 --> 02:08:47.931
But he's still alive.

1522
02:08:48.682 --> 02:08:53.187
It's strange. knowing now who
it was this whole time. but...

1523
02:08:54.772 --> 02:08:57.191
I can still remember what he thinks.

1524
02:08:57.274 --> 02:08:59.026
and how he thinks.

1525
02:09:01.445 --> 02:09:03.030
And he's not going to stop.

1526
02:09:03.822 --> 02:09:04.822
Ever.

1527
02:09:05.532 --> 02:09:07.701
Not until he's taken everything.

1528
02:09:08.243 --> 02:09:09.453
And everyone.

1529
02:09:11.246 --> 02:09:12.748
We have to kill him.

1530
02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:15.542
And we will.

1531
02:09:16.919 --> 02:09:18.003
We will.

1532
02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:36.020
Government.

1533
02:10:30.409 --> 02:10:31.660
Max?

1534
02:10:35.205 --> 02:10:36.749
Max?

1535
02:10:39.251 --> 02:10:40.502
Max!

1536
02:10:43.964 --> 02:10:45.257
Max!

1537
02:10:47.342 --> 02:10:49.428
Max!

1538
02:11:15.788 --> 02:11:16.788
Hey. kid.

1539
02:11:23.545 --> 02:11:24.630
Hi.

1540
02:11:43.649 --> 02:11:45.150
I kept it open.

1541
02:11:46.902 --> 02:11:49.696
- I kept the door open three inches.
- I know.

1542
02:11:49.780 --> 02:11:51.824
I never stopped believing.

1543
02:11:51.907 --> 02:11:53.784
Oh. I know. It's okay.

1544
02:11:53.867 --> 02:11:54.868
It's okay.

1545
02:11:54.952 --> 02:11:57.329
It's okay. I'm here.

1546
02:11:58.872 --> 02:12:00.457
I'm here.

1547
02:12:10.634 --> 02:12:12.719
You look...

1548
02:12:14.721 --> 02:12:16.306
Not fat?

1549
02:12:19.309 --> 02:12:20.769
And your hair.

1550
02:12:20.853 --> 02:12:21.854
My hair?

1551
02:12:22.896 --> 02:12:23.896
Look at your hair.

1552
02:12:32.030 --> 02:12:33.448
Yeah.

1553
02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:37.411
I kinda stole your look. kid.

1554
02:12:39.371 --> 02:12:40.371
Yeah.

1555
02:12:40.914 --> 02:12:42.124
Well. what do you think?

1556
02:12:43.917 --> 02:12:45.586
- Bitchin'.
- Hmm.

1557
02:13:05.230 --> 02:13:07.482
You aren't the only one
that didn't stop believing.

1558
02:13:19.536 --> 02:13:20.537
Oh!

1559
02:13:26.376 --> 02:13:27.376
I'm happy

1560
02:13:27.878 --> 02:13:29.004
you went to your...

1561
02:13:30.714 --> 02:13:31.840
conference.

1562
02:13:32.716 --> 02:13:34.885
That was quite the experience.

1563
02:13:35.802 --> 02:13:36.803
Oh.

1564
02:13:56.239 --> 02:13:57.240
Hey.

1565
02:14:01.036 --> 02:14:02.037
You've grown.

1566
02:14:03.038 --> 02:14:04.038
Yeah.

1567
02:14:05.624 --> 02:14:06.833
You shrunk.

1568
02:14:55.549 --> 02:14:57.509
Mom. it's snowing!
