00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.685
Shit! Oh.
shit! Oh. shit! Oh. shit!

3
00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:21.187
- God.
- Keep pressure on it.

4
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.523
- It's not slowing.
- Keep putting pressure on it.

5
00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:26.067
- More pressure. Get the napkins.
- Come on.

6
00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:27.819
- More napkins.
- Shit.

7
00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:30.363
- It's not slowing.
- Argyle! Get us to St. Mary's.

8
00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.741
I don't think praying's
gonna help that dude.

9
00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:35.785
- No. you idiot! St. Mary's Hospital.
- No. no.

10
00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.412
- What?
- No hospital.

11
00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:40.582
- We're gonna get you to the hospital.
- You need to warn...

12
00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.959
... O... Owens.

13
00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:44.711
- Owens. okay.
- The girl.

14
00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:46.671
She... She's in danger.

15
00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:48.673
Okay. how... how do we find Owens?

16
00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:50.675
Nina. Nina.

17
00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:52.844
- Nina. Who's Nina?
- Come on. A pen.

18
00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:54.345
- Okay.
- Shit.

19
00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.514
- Here's the number.
- Number. Number.

20
00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:58.975
- He wants to write something.
- We can call this Nina?

21
00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.728
Grab a magazine or
something. Will. get something.

22
00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:04.022
- He's really bleeding a lot.
- Right here.

23
00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:06.107
- Come on. Hey.
- Write the number.

24
00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:07.734
Hey! Look at me!

25
00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:09.319
- Hey! Come on!
- Hold on!

26
00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:10.987
- Oh. shit.
- Hey!

27
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.114
Hey. yo. yo. Wait. wait. wait.

28
00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:15.075
Why is it so quiet back there. huh?

29
00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:18.703
Yo. is he dead? Jesus. man.

30
00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:20.997
Talk to me! Shit!

31
00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.708
We should get off the road.

32
00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.378
Argyle. Ar... Argyle.
get off the road. now!

33
00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:28.922
Shit. he's dead. isn't he?

34
00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:31.091
- This is real bad.
- What are you doing?

35
00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:32.967
Get off the road!

36
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.430
Listen.

37
00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.684
I know she was just here.

38
00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:24.102
And if you wanna live...

39
00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:28.106
you're gonna tell me where she is.

40
00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.547
Apologies for the bumpy ride. kiddo.

41
00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.175
I would've paved the road. but...

42
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.554
kinda ruins the whole "top
secret location" thing.

43
00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:02.724
Did you get some rest?

44
00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.144
- A little.
- Good.

45
00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:09.314
I have a feeling you're gonna need it.

46
00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:25.639
Oop.

47
00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:29.185
Okay. Here we go.

48
00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:41.864
You didn't really think we were
working out of a shed. did you?

49
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.595
You built all this?

50
00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:07.515
Well. more gave it a face-lift.

51
00:05:08.057 --> 00:05:09.934
Do you know what an ICBM is?

52
00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:13.563
It stands for intercontinental
ballistic missile.

53
00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:15.440
It's a... a fancy bomb.

54
00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:17.835
We used to store them in these silos.

55
00:05:17.836 --> 00:05:19.570
but we haven't used this one in years.

56
00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:21.821
In fact. there... there's
no bomb here at all.

57
00:05:21.904 --> 00:05:24.824
It's just a big ol' empty space.

58
00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:27.280
So we repurposed it to hold something

59
00:05:27.281 --> 00:05:29.037
much more powerful than a missile:

60
00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:31.080
you.

61
00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:36.377
- Anne. Tracy. Morning.
- Morning. Doc.

62
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:37.545
Morning.

63
00:05:37.628 --> 00:05:39.620
You'll have to forgive the staring.

64
00:05:39.621 --> 00:05:41.424
You're a bit of a celebrity down here.

65
00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:43.176
- I am?
- Oh yeah. You kidding?

66
00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.137
You... You're bigger
than Madonna to them.

67
00:05:46.804 --> 00:05:50.016
They've all given up their
lives. their jobs. their families

68
00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:53.311
to come work on this program.
'cause they believe in the cause.

69
00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:56.022
They believe in you.

70
00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:03.738
It's okay. Yeah.

71
00:06:07.825 --> 00:06:09.327
We call her Nina.

72
00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:15.375
What is it?

73
00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:18.878
If we told you. it
would ruin the surprise.

74
00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:28.346
Hello. Eleven.

75
00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:31.681
I know.

76
00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:33.893
You're frightened of me.

77
00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:38.439
Perhaps. in our time apart. you
may have even grown to hate me.

78
00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:41.526
But all I've ever wanted to do

79
00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:43.486
is to help you.

80
00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:47.907
And right now. I think
you very much need my help.

81
00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:51.494
Your gifts have been stolen.

82
00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:53.830
I believe I know why.

83
00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:57.333
And I believe I know
how to get them back.

84
00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:01.462
Let us work together again.

85
00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:03.756
You and I.

86
00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:05.967
Daughter

87
00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:07.802
and Papa.

88
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:09.971
Papa!

89
00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:25.695
Yeah. I got her.

90
00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:33.411
Why don't you go back inside?
Play nice for the doctor. hmm?

91
00:07:35.746 --> 00:07:36.746
No!

92
00:07:37.498 --> 00:07:38.666
No!

93
00:07:41.752 --> 00:07:43.087
The more you move.

94
00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:45.465
- the more this is gonna hurt.
- No! No! No!

95
00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:48.008
Leave her.

96
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.890
- No.
- I'm... I'm sorry. Eleven.

97
00:07:54.765 --> 00:07:57.393
This is not how I
wanted things to begin.

98
00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:01.689
But everything's going to be all right.

99
00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:04.525
You're home now.

100
00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.029
You're home.

101
00:09:42.873 --> 00:09:43.958
Enough!

102
00:09:46.043 --> 00:09:47.795
He is not yours to kill.

103
00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:50.047
Fools.

104
00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:56.637
What I tell you. American?

105
00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:58.931
No run.

106
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.809
You don't listen.

107
00:10:03.894 --> 00:10:06.147
Now is going to be much pain.

108
00:10:08.357 --> 00:10:09.358
Much.

109
00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:52.610
It could be worse. American.

110
00:10:53.235 --> 00:10:54.779
At least you have company.

111
00:11:01.869 --> 00:11:03.829
Your eyes don't deceive you.

112
00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.498
I'm a prisoner now.

113
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:06.581
Like you.

114
00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:10.628
Yuri. the smuggler. he betrayed me.

115
00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:12.546
Betrayed us.

116
00:11:15.883 --> 00:11:17.635
The pig's in trouble now.

117
00:11:17.718 --> 00:11:20.012
You said
we could trust him!

118
00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:21.305
You swore to me!

119
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:23.307
Because I believed we could.

120
00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:25.226
You think this is what I planned?

121
00:11:25.309 --> 00:11:27.019
I have lost everything. Everything!

122
00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:29.271
We both knew the risks. Both of us.

123
00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:31.482
Do us all
a favor. Finish him!

124
00:11:31.565 --> 00:11:33.275
We gambled today.

125
00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:34.776
and we lost.

126
00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:37.363
We lost.

127
00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:40.950
Finish him!

128
00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:51.293
Joyce.

129
00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:52.920
What about Joyce?

130
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.068
There you are. my girl!

131
00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.152
Mwah!

132
00:12:23.492 --> 00:12:25.327
Why the long faces?

133
00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:29.915
Are you not excited for your
journey across the Iron Curtain?

134
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.795
Yuri. I have a family. I have
three kids waiting for me.

135
00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:37.923
Did you know? Peanut butter
is banned in motherland.

136
00:12:38.507 --> 00:12:40.468
I buy for dollar-thirty here.

137
00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:42.595
sell for $20 there.

138
00:12:42.678 --> 00:12:44.847
Your mother must be very proud.

139
00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.766
My mother is dead.

140
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.518
Dead...

141
00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:51.312
tired of living like a bum!

142
00:12:54.648 --> 00:12:55.775
You see?

143
00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:57.651
Yuri has family too.

144
00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:00.905
And with money I earn from selling you.

145
00:13:00.988 --> 00:13:02.448
I will buy her a new house.

146
00:13:02.531 --> 00:13:04.074
I will buy my daughter

147
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:05.868
a pony.

148
00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:08.621
Whatever they desire from
now on. they will have.

149
00:13:08.704 --> 00:13:10.581
And. yes. for that.

150
00:13:10.664 --> 00:13:13.709

Um. I'm gonna need a food delivery.

like. really soon. unless you
want me going out into the world.

177
00:14:49.513 --> 00:14:51.307
No. No. no. no. Don't do that.

178

Stay where you are. and we'll
be there as soon as we can.

179

Yeah. yeah. yeah.

Listen. um... can you
pick me up a six-pack?

00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:01.483
I know. it's stupid as
shit. drinking right now.

182
00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:05.195
but a cold beer would really
calm my jangled nerves.

183
00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:06.822
Hey. I'm gonna have to call you back.

184
00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:09.867
No. don't you da... Wheeler? Wheeler?

185
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:10.950
- Dustin!
- Mm.

186
00:15:10.951 --> 00:15:12.119
- Wake up.
- What?

187
00:15:12.202 --> 00:15:13.787
Aren't you supposed to be on Max watch?

188
00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:14.955
Yep. Yep. yep. yep.

189
00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:16.248
- Sorry.
- Then where is she?

190
00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:18.250
She's right there. A second ago.

191
00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:20.419
I swear. I just dozed off for...

192
00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:23.714
... an hour.

193
00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:31.096
Morning. guys.

194
00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:33.307
Everything okay?

195
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:34.390
Yeah.

196
00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:37.478
Yeah. everything's okay.

197
00:15:37.561 --> 00:15:41.982
I think it's so sweet that you guys
are sticking together like this.

198
00:15:42.066 --> 00:15:45.527
Could try sticking together at
a different house for a change.

199
00:15:48.155 --> 00:15:49.782
You know you're welcome anytime.

200
00:15:49.865 --> 00:15:51.951
Totally. You're like family.

201
00:15:52.826 --> 00:15:54.578
- May I?
- Absolutely.

202
00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:57.206
Yeah. why not? Take
us for all we're worth.

203
00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:58.957
Okay.

204
00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:05.756
♪ You wanna feel how it feels? ♪

205
00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:07.633
- ♪ Yeah. yeah ♪
- ♪ You wanna know ♪

206
00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:11.553
- Hey.
- Hey.

207
00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:13.973
You okay?

208
00:16:14.598 --> 00:16:15.808
Just couldn't sleep.

209
00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:19.353
People kept blasting music
in my ears. for some reason.

210
00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:23.482
But Holly let me borrow
some of her crayons.

211
00:16:23.565 --> 00:16:25.985
- We've been having fun. right. Holly?
- Mm-hmm.

212
00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:30.864
Is this what you saw last night?

213
00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:33.075
I mean. it's supposed to be.

214
00:16:33.867 --> 00:16:37.121
I thought it'd be easier to draw
it out than to explain it. but...

215
00:16:38.372 --> 00:16:39.372
not so much.

216
00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:40.791
Is that... ?

217
00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:43.669
It was like they were on display.

218
00:16:43.752 --> 00:16:47.089
And then there was
this red fog everywhere.

219
00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:48.632
It was like a dream.

220
00:16:48.716 --> 00:16:50.050
A nightmare.

221
00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:52.302
You think Vecna's just
trying to scare you?

222
00:16:52.386 --> 00:16:53.762
With Billy? Yeah.

223
00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:55.264
But when I made it here...

224
00:16:56.223 --> 00:16:57.891
I dunno. something was different.

225
00:16:57.975 --> 00:16:59.768
He seemed surprised. almost.

226
00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:01.645
Like he didn't want me there.

227
00:17:02.396 --> 00:17:03.981
Maybe you infiltrated his mind.

228
00:17:04.064 --> 00:17:05.607
He invaded your mind. right?

229
00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:08.694
Is it that big a leap to suggest
you somehow wound up in his?

230
00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:10.946
Like Freddie Krueger's boiler room.

231
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.364
Freddie Krueger?

232
00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:15.951
He's a super burned-up dude
with razors for fingers.

233
00:17:16.035 --> 00:17:18.287
- And he kills you in your dreams.
- Seriously?

234
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.916
Sorry. It's a movie.

235
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.126
It's not real.

236
00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:26.170
Just... think about it.

237
00:17:26.253 --> 00:17:29.965
What if you somehow unlocked
a backdoor to Vecna's world?

238
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:32.259
Like. maybe the answer
we're looking for is

239
00:17:32.801 --> 00:17:36.472
somewhere in this
incredibly vague drawing.

240
00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:38.265
- God. we need Will.
- No shit.

241
00:17:38.348 --> 00:17:42.102
But I tried them again this morning.
and it's the same busy signal.

242
00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:44.146
Is this a window?

243
00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:45.355
Yeah.

244
00:17:45.439 --> 00:17:46.899
Stained glass with roses.

245
00:17:46.982 --> 00:17:49.359
Yeah. See? I'm not
so terrible after all.

246
00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:52.863
Yeah. well. it helps
that I've seen it before.

247
00:18:23.977 --> 00:18:25.229
It's pieces of a house.

248
00:18:27.147 --> 00:18:28.147
Not just any house.

249
00:18:36.448 --> 00:18:37.825
It's Victor Creel's house.

250
00:18:38.742 --> 00:18:39.868
Where you going?

251
00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:41.370
Waking the others.

252
00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:45.666
Sorry. fuel for the
road. Thanks. Mr. Wheeler!

253
00:19:09.731 --> 00:19:10.731
No.

254
00:19:14.027 --> 00:19:15.279
No.

255
00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.260
No.

256
00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:21.697
Well. well.

257
00:21:22.656 --> 00:21:24.908
Look who finally decided to join us.

258
00:21:26.159 --> 00:21:28.287
Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.

259
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:29.788
Where am I?

260
00:21:29.871 --> 00:21:32.040
I guess you're still
not quite awake. huh?

261
00:21:32.582 --> 00:21:34.376
Am I in Hawkins?

262
00:21:42.676 --> 00:21:43.760
Well. well.

263
00:21:44.386 --> 00:21:46.305
Look who finally decided to join us.

264
00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:51.143
Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.

265
00:21:59.568 --> 00:22:01.528
Don't go too far. sleepyhead.

266
00:22:02.446 --> 00:22:04.406
Lessons begin promptly at 10:00.

267
00:22:29.765 --> 00:22:30.849
Well. well.

268
00:22:31.808 --> 00:22:34.102
Look who finally decided to join us.

269
00:22:35.896 --> 00:22:37.773
Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.

270
00:22:41.234 --> 00:22:43.236
Heart rate's now 120 BPM.

271
00:22:44.613 --> 00:22:47.324
- She's rejecting it.
- Give her time.

272
00:22:47.824 --> 00:22:51.244
No. no. no. We shouldn't have
just thrown her in like this.

273
00:22:51.328 --> 00:22:53.497
- She's gonna drown in there.
- No.

274
00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:56.166
No. she is going to swim.

275
00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:07.969
Oh man.

276
00:23:10.472 --> 00:23:13.350
Okay. This is not the way
it's supposed to go. okay?

277
00:23:13.433 --> 00:23:15.936
Oh man. oh man. oh man.
Okay. this is so messed up.

278
00:23:16.019 --> 00:23:18.313
This is so messed up!
This is so messed up!

279
00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:21.274
Okay. Dude's probably got.
like. a family. kids. you know.

280
00:23:21.358 --> 00:23:23.860
All that shit. We gotta
go to the cops with this.

281
00:23:23.944 --> 00:23:27.406
Lay it all on 'em. Your superpowered
girlfriend. bad government dudes.

282
00:23:27.489 --> 00:23:29.366
- Upside Down dimension planet thing...
- No.

283
00:23:29.449 --> 00:23:30.951
But... But listen!

284
00:23:31.034 --> 00:23:33.300
The bad government dudes are
after your super girlfriend. right?

285
00:23:33.301 --> 00:23:34.913
Right? Okay.

286
00:23:34.996 --> 00:23:37.499
So maybe cops can help
us find out where she is.

287
00:23:37.582 --> 00:23:38.708
They're gonna kill her.

288
00:23:38.792 --> 00:23:40.585
- If they kill her. they're gonna kill us.
- Hey!

289
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:42.838
They might kill us before they kill her.

290
00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:44.256
- I dunno. man.
- Argyle!

291
00:23:44.339 --> 00:23:47.050
- Don't know what order they wanna go.
- Listen! Hey!

292
00:23:47.134 --> 00:23:48.510
- Eeny meeny miny moe...
- Argyle!

293
00:23:48.593 --> 00:23:49.970
- Listen!
- What?

294
00:23:50.053 --> 00:23:53.306
Look. I think we can
figure this out. okay?

295
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:55.308
We just gotta open our minds.

296
00:23:55.392 --> 00:23:57.727
Open our minds? That's an
open grave in front of me. man!

297
00:23:57.811 --> 00:24:01.231
- Open my mind? What are you talking about?
- Listen. Hey. dude! Hey!

298
00:24:01.314 --> 00:24:03.859
Just relax. okay?

299
00:24:03.942 --> 00:24:06.111
- Yeah.
- Why don't you just go to the van...

300
00:24:06.194 --> 00:24:09.114
... and do your thing. huh?

301
00:24:09.197 --> 00:24:10.866
- Purple Palm Tree Delight.
- Right.

302
00:24:10.949 --> 00:24:12.701
Right.

303
00:24:12.784 --> 00:24:13.785
It's all worn off.

304
00:24:13.869 --> 00:24:14.870
It's just worn off.

305
00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:16.455
I'm all emotional.

306
00:24:16.955 --> 00:24:19.124
- You're emotional.
- Okay.

307
00:24:20.709 --> 00:24:22.711
- I'm sorry.
- You're fine.

308
00:24:22.794 --> 00:24:24.129
- Jonathan.
- Yeah?

309
00:24:24.212 --> 00:24:26.214
More weed? Is that
really a good idea now?

310
00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:28.175
Got a better idea to keep him calm?

311
00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:30.594
Let's just get this done.

312
00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.147
You can't let him get to you.

313
00:24:42.647 --> 00:24:45.442
He's stoned out of his mind.
Doesn't know what he's talking about.

314
00:24:45.525 --> 00:24:47.360
That doesn't mean he's wrong.

315
00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:51.615
I mean. if that guy would've lived
one more second. one more second.

316
00:24:51.698 --> 00:24:53.575
then w... we would know where she is.

317
00:24:54.493 --> 00:24:56.495
Wh... Why didn't he just say the number?

318
00:24:58.955 --> 00:25:00.290
I should've explained myself.

319
00:25:00.373 --> 00:25:02.375
Maybe Eleven would've taken me with her

320
00:25:02.376 --> 00:25:03.835
and things would be different. but...

321
00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:06.588
- No.
- I didn't... I didn't know what to say.

322
00:25:07.547 --> 00:25:12.594
Sometimes I think it's just
scary to open up like that.

323
00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:15.138
To say how you really feel.

324
00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.851
Especially to people
you care about the most.

325
00:25:20.644 --> 00:25:22.646
Because. what if...

326
00:25:23.146 --> 00:25:24.856
what if they don't like the truth?

327
00:25:28.318 --> 00:25:30.278
Does anybody know the dead dude's name?

328
00:25:30.362 --> 00:25:32.197
- What?
- The dead dude.

329
00:25:32.948 --> 00:25:34.324
I'm making him a headstone.

330
00:25:34.407 --> 00:25:37.577
You do realize we spent
all morning hiding the body.

331
00:25:37.661 --> 00:25:41.331
Well. I'll just write. uh. "Here
Lies Unknown Hero Agent Man."

332
00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:45.752
Yeah. "Saved Argyle. Jonathan.
Will. and Mike from certain death."

333
00:25:45.835 --> 00:25:49.714
You... You're gonna write
our names on the pizza box?

334
00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.925
They're pretty common names.

335
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:54.302
Okay. dude. Uh. do your thing.

336
00:25:54.386 --> 00:25:56.304
Jesus Christ.

337
00:25:58.098 --> 00:25:59.182
Come on. man.

338
00:25:59.975 --> 00:26:01.184
That's his pen.

339
00:26:01.851 --> 00:26:02.851
What?

340
00:26:02.894 --> 00:26:04.604
Unknown Hero Agent Man.

341
00:26:04.688 --> 00:26:07.274
that's the pen he gave
me right before he died.

342
00:26:07.357 --> 00:26:08.608
Piece of shit.

343
00:26:08.692 --> 00:26:10.735
Why would he give me
a pen that didn't work?

344
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.996
Come on.

345
00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:22.706
Hey. man. I'm using that.

346
00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:24.874
What are you doing?

347
00:26:26.167 --> 00:26:28.169
Something fell outta that pen. man.

348
00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:29.421
Wh... What is it?

349
00:26:33.216 --> 00:26:34.217
It's the number.

350
00:26:35.302 --> 00:26:36.761
We've had it this whole time.

351
00:26:36.845 --> 00:26:38.221
We got his digits. man?

352
00:26:49.566 --> 00:26:51.610
Did I tell you it's okay to break?

353
00:26:51.693 --> 00:26:54.362
Over there. there is a hand.

354
00:26:54.446 --> 00:26:55.572
A HAND!

355
00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:57.532
Are we animals?

356
00:26:59.868 --> 00:27:01.328
Psst!

357
00:27:01.411 --> 00:27:03.913
Hey. Ivan. Ivan!

358
00:27:12.547 --> 00:27:15.175
Stop calling my name.

359
00:27:15.258 --> 00:27:17.552
You trying to get me in trouble?

360
00:27:17.636 --> 00:27:19.929
I don't know what they've told you.

361
00:27:20.013 --> 00:27:21.473
but it is all lies.

362
00:27:21.556 --> 00:27:23.016
I'm here by mistake!

363
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.060
I'm sorry. I cannot help you.

364
00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:29.439
I can make you rich.

365
00:27:35.904 --> 00:27:37.489
See this American?

366
00:27:38.406 --> 00:27:39.616
He comes from money.

367
00:27:41.826 --> 00:27:43.036
Old money.

368
00:27:44.537 --> 00:27:47.957
Tell him. American. Tell him
how you will make him rich.

369
00:27:58.218 --> 00:28:00.387
You're a real help.
American. you know that?

370
00:28:02.263 --> 00:28:03.640
A real help.

371
00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:07.560
Hey.

372
00:28:09.604 --> 00:28:12.065
You want to die here? You
want to die? Is that it?

373
00:28:12.148 --> 00:28:14.317
That's what we've been
brought here to do.

374
00:28:14.401 --> 00:28:16.528
So. that is it? You give up. then?

375
00:28:24.953 --> 00:28:26.371
What about your woman. huh?

376
00:28:27.288 --> 00:28:29.749
She's captured. yes. but still alive.

377
00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:31.376
We can still save her.

378
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:33.586
"Save her."

379
00:28:35.755 --> 00:28:38.007
That is amusing to you?

380
00:28:38.633 --> 00:28:40.760
You don't get it. do
you? You don't get it.

381
00:28:42.095 --> 00:28:44.764
The closer I get with Joyce.
the more danger she's in.

382
00:28:46.141 --> 00:28:48.309
You're not thinking straight. American.

383
00:28:48.393 --> 00:28:49.769
No. I think I am.

384
00:28:51.312 --> 00:28:54.399
For the first time in my life.
I think I'm thinking straight.

385
00:28:57.986 --> 00:28:59.946
I used to think I was cursed.

386
00:29:01.573 --> 00:29:02.866
Ever since I was 18.

387
00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:06.035
Got some letter of
induction in the mail.

388
00:29:06.119 --> 00:29:08.913
Uncle Sam wants me to go
fight some war in the jungle.

389
00:29:09.497 --> 00:29:11.552
Charlie's moving south like a plague

390
00:29:11.553 --> 00:29:14.085
'cause of commie
bastards like you. and...

391
00:29:14.878 --> 00:29:16.629
You know. I'm happy enough to go.

392
00:29:17.172 --> 00:29:20.341
Prove to my old man I'm not the
piece of shit he thinks I am.

393
00:29:22.177 --> 00:29:23.920
I get over there. I must test well.

394
00:29:23.921 --> 00:29:25.847
and they put me in the Chemical Corps.

395
00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:28.516
There I am. I'm just... a kid. you know.

396
00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.435
I'm 18 years old. 8.000 miles away.

397
00:29:30.518 --> 00:29:35.482
and I'm mixing up these...
55-gallon drums of Agent Orange.

398
00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:39.235
With just these kitchen
gloves. you know?

399
00:29:40.528 --> 00:29:43.323
We used to clean out these
buffalo turbines after a run

400
00:29:43.406 --> 00:29:45.158
and just be inhaling the stuff.

401
00:29:45.241 --> 00:29:46.576
No masks. nothing.

402
00:29:49.954 --> 00:29:53.958
"It's not chemical warfare. It's
just herbicide to kill plants."

403
00:29:55.752 --> 00:29:58.171
"Harmless." That's what they told us.

404
00:30:01.841 --> 00:30:03.092
Then I got back to real life.

405
00:30:03.176 --> 00:30:05.428
and these guys I worked with.
the ones that made it back.

406
00:30:05.512 --> 00:30:08.348
they started trying to get
back to normal. you know?

407
00:30:08.431 --> 00:30:11.059
Having families. And then
things started going wrong.

408
00:30:13.478 --> 00:30:16.439
Kids born stillborn. Dead in the womb.

409
00:30:18.483 --> 00:30:20.777
Crooked spines. eyes popped out.

410
00:30:23.905 --> 00:30:24.906
The horror...

411
00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:29.327
followed us. clung to us.

412
00:30:31.412 --> 00:30:33.164
My wife Diane. she wanted a baby.

413
00:30:34.332 --> 00:30:35.750
I did too.

414
00:30:37.293 --> 00:30:39.254
We had a baby. and she was. um...

415
00:30:40.463 --> 00:30:41.673
she was born healthy.

416
00:30:41.756 --> 00:30:43.424
She was perfect. you know. Sara.

417
00:30:44.968 --> 00:30:46.177
And then she died.

418
00:30:46.261 --> 00:30:47.887
Blood pressure's dropping.

419
00:30:47.971 --> 00:30:49.931
It wasn't an easy death. She...

420
00:30:51.224 --> 00:30:52.224
suffered.

421
00:30:53.601 --> 00:30:55.311
I knew the risks. but I. um...

422
00:30:57.188 --> 00:30:58.314
I hid them.

423
00:31:00.108 --> 00:31:03.528
And then Diane left me. She
didn't blame me. Not with words.

424
00:31:04.153 --> 00:31:05.613
After that. I was just...

425
00:31:08.616 --> 00:31:11.077
I just hid myself in drugs and alcohol.

426
00:31:13.413 --> 00:31:15.582
And then people started
coming into my life.

427
00:31:17.542 --> 00:31:19.290
This girl El. and Joyce just happened.

428
00:31:19.291 --> 00:31:22.338
and I told myself they needed me.

429
00:31:23.256 --> 00:31:24.674
But that wasn't true.

430
00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:28.720
That's a lie. They didn't need me.

431
00:31:31.139 --> 00:31:32.307
I needed them.

432
00:31:35.602 --> 00:31:36.686
I needed them.

433
00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:41.274
You were right. what you said
last night. I knew the risks.

434
00:31:41.357 --> 00:31:43.484
breaking out of here.
but I did it anyway.

435
00:31:45.236 --> 00:31:48.156
The minute I sent for Joyce.
the minute I sent for her.

436
00:31:49.532 --> 00:31:51.117
I sentenced her to death.

437
00:31:52.035 --> 00:31:53.828
Just like I did with Sara.

438
00:32:00.793 --> 00:32:02.795
Everyone I love. I hurt.

439
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.762
See. I was wrong this whole time.

440
00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:13.640
I wasn't cursed.

441
00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:18.853
I am the curse.

442
00:32:35.036 --> 00:32:36.746
I've heard rumors of a monster.

443
00:32:37.747 --> 00:32:38.915
From America.

444
00:32:41.459 --> 00:32:44.003
I don't know if what you
say is true. American.

445
00:32:44.087 --> 00:32:47.799
if you're truly a cursed man.
but you're right about one thing.

446
00:32:48.716 --> 00:32:50.760
We are going to die in here.

447
00:33:17.954 --> 00:33:18.954
Can I help you?

448
00:33:19.872 --> 00:33:21.249
We need to look around.

449
00:33:37.807 --> 00:33:38.807
Yep.

450
00:33:39.934 --> 00:33:41.769
I think it's some kind of leak.

451
00:33:43.563 --> 00:33:46.441
I haven't had a chance to fix
it with everything going on.

452
00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.402
Pack your things. We're moving you.

453
00:34:01.748 --> 00:34:03.249
The devil is here.

454
00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:05.668
I can feel his presence...

455
00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:11.340
growing stronger each day.

456
00:34:11.924 --> 00:34:13.926
But I know Chrissy's in heaven now.

457
00:34:15.053 --> 00:34:16.971
looking down at us. smiling.

458
00:34:18.014 --> 00:34:20.725
Happy to see all the lives
she touched and brightened.

459
00:34:21.768 --> 00:34:23.770
But I also know she's frustrated.

460
00:34:24.979 --> 00:34:25.980
Angry.

461
00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:29.650
That the monster that did
this to her is still out there.

462
00:34:30.234 --> 00:34:31.319
Still.

463
00:34:32.487 --> 00:34:33.654
Hurting others.

464
00:34:34.447 --> 00:34:37.366
How can he live. while my angel is gone?

465
00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:40.161
I know God has a plan...

466
00:34:48.836 --> 00:34:50.546
Lord. I've prayed.

467
00:34:52.507 --> 00:34:54.467
And I just do not understand it.

468
00:34:55.843 --> 00:34:57.303
I see no reason.

469
00:34:58.304 --> 00:34:59.472
I see no reason.

470
00:34:59.555 --> 00:35:01.808
So I finally got ahold of Cappelletti.

471
00:35:03.392 --> 00:35:04.811
Photos for the '86 yearbook.

472
00:35:05.603 --> 00:35:06.603
Hot damn.

473
00:35:08.314 --> 00:35:09.649
Sinclair?

474
00:35:09.732 --> 00:35:11.067
Goddamn traitor.

475
00:35:11.567 --> 00:35:13.736
Only reason he'd lead us to a dead end.

476
00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.029
The Hellfire Club.

477
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:18.366
- They're hiding Eddie.
- Maybe we should bring this to the cops.

478
00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:20.576
The cops who think
Chrissy's a drug dealer?

479
00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.995
Who are letting this... this
psycho go around killing people?

480
00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:25.873
I'm just saying. what if
this cult is doing shit to us?

481
00:35:25.957 --> 00:35:28.459
- Doing what?
- They already know we're after them.

482
00:35:29.627 --> 00:35:33.047
- What if they cursed us or some shit?
- Patrick thinks he's cursed.

483
00:35:33.131 --> 00:35:34.757
Hey!

484
00:35:34.841 --> 00:35:36.175
None of this is funny.

485
00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:40.138
Look. I don't believe in that
supernatural crap. all right?

486
00:35:40.221 --> 00:35:42.223
But this cult is dangerous.

487
00:35:42.306 --> 00:35:43.891
We have to be smart about this.

488
00:35:45.685 --> 00:35:46.686
I made a list.

489
00:35:46.769 --> 00:35:48.771
Everywhere these freaks have been seen.

490
00:35:48.855 --> 00:35:52.024
We divide and conquer. Check 'em
out one by one. Smoke 'em out.

491
00:35:52.108 --> 00:35:53.943
We should add Reefer
Rick's house to this.

492
00:35:54.026 --> 00:35:55.069
What?

493
00:35:55.153 --> 00:35:56.195
Reefer Rick.

494
00:35:56.904 --> 00:35:58.156
He's Eddie's supplier.

495
00:35:58.157 --> 00:35:59.160
He's supposed to be in prison.

496
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.868
but someone spotted
him back in his house.

497
00:36:02.451 --> 00:36:04.537
Now my parents are
freaking out and shit.

498
00:36:05.121 --> 00:36:06.414
It's probably nothing.

499
00:36:06.497 --> 00:36:07.623
I don't know.

500
00:36:07.707 --> 00:36:09.625
No. that's good. That's good.

501
00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:12.128
No stones unturned.

502
00:36:40.656 --> 00:36:42.658
Yeah. that's not creepy.

503
00:36:44.911 --> 00:36:48.748
What exactly are we supposed to
be looking for in this shithole?

504
00:36:48.831 --> 00:36:49.999
We're not sure.

505
00:36:50.082 --> 00:36:52.460
We just know this house
is important to Vecna.

506
00:36:52.543 --> 00:36:55.379
Because Max saw it in
Vecna's red soup mind world?

507
00:36:55.463 --> 00:36:56.923
- Basically.
- Great.

508
00:36:57.006 --> 00:36:58.520
Maybe it holds a clue to where Vecna is.

509
00:36:58.521 --> 00:37:00.301
Why he's back. Why he killed the Creels.

510
00:37:00.384 --> 00:37:03.346
And how to stop him before
he comes back for Max.

511
00:37:03.429 --> 00:37:05.514
We don't think he's in here.

512
00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:07.642
do we?

513
00:37:07.725 --> 00:37:09.185
Guess we'll find out.

514
00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:10.228
Ready?

515
00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:12.021
Mm-hmm.

516
00:37:17.068 --> 00:37:19.153
Max.

517
00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:21.906
What are you doing in here.

518
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.033
Max?

519
00:37:26.661 --> 00:37:27.912
It's locked.

520
00:37:27.995 --> 00:37:29.789
Should I knock. see if anybody's home?

521
00:37:29.872 --> 00:37:30.873
No need.

522
00:37:34.794 --> 00:37:35.836
I found a key.

523
00:38:07.618 --> 00:38:09.996
Looks like someone forgot
to pay their electric bill.

524
00:38:12.581 --> 00:38:13.958
Where'd everyone get those?

525
00:38:16.877 --> 00:38:18.879
Do you need to be told everything?

526
00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:21.257
You're not a child.

527
00:38:21.841 --> 00:38:22.883
- Thank you.
- Huh.

528
00:38:24.927 --> 00:38:25.927
Back pocket.

529
00:38:36.772 --> 00:38:39.358
They just left everything.

530
00:38:40.109 --> 00:38:42.778
I guess a triple homicide
isn't good for resale value.

531
00:38:44.947 --> 00:38:45.947
Hey. guys?

532
00:38:47.283 --> 00:38:48.826
You all see that. right?

533
00:38:49.785 --> 00:38:51.245
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

534
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.042
Is this what you saw?

535
00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:58.210
In your visions?

536
00:39:02.256 --> 00:39:04.925
I mean. it's... just a clock.

537
00:39:05.593 --> 00:39:06.593
Right?

538
00:39:15.603 --> 00:39:17.271
Like a normal old clock.

539
00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:19.982
Why is this wizard obsessed with clocks?

540
00:39:21.108 --> 00:39:24.570
Maybe he's. like. a
clockmaker or something?

541
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.656
I think you cracked the case. Steve.

542
00:39:28.741 --> 00:39:29.950
All I know is

543
00:39:30.826 --> 00:39:32.119
the answers are here.

544
00:39:33.329 --> 00:39:34.329
Somewhere.

545
00:39:35.956 --> 00:39:39.001
Okay. everyone stay in groups
of two. Robin. upstairs.

546
00:39:41.587 --> 00:39:42.755
Come on. Let's go.

547
00:39:47.968 --> 00:39:50.221
- Was that a sigh?
- No. I did not sigh.

548
00:39:51.138 --> 00:39:53.724
- Why'd you sigh?
- I didn't sigh. Just come on. dude.

549
00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:56.977
- I heard you.
- W... We're just always partners. okay?

550
00:39:57.061 --> 00:39:58.604
You have a problem with that?

551
00:39:58.687 --> 00:40:01.190
It'd just be nice to. I
don't know. mix it up a bit.

552
00:40:01.273 --> 00:40:03.401
- I'm boring you? Is that it?
- No. the opposite...

553
00:40:09.782 --> 00:40:10.782
Ah.

554
00:40:11.242 --> 00:40:12.243
Hey. Yuri.

555
00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:15.246
Yuri. I need to take a piss here.

556
00:40:15.329 --> 00:40:17.331
Just give it up. He can't hear you.

557
00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:19.667
I really do have to go. Joyce.

558
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.335
This isn't some ploy to escape.

559
00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:27.633
- He can't hear.
- What?

560
00:40:33.389 --> 00:40:34.932
Joyce. what are you doing?

561
00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.685
Joyce! Joyce!

562
00:40:38.769 --> 00:40:41.147
- Joyce!
- My leg is too short.

563
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:42.982
Can you grab that shard with your foot?

564
00:40:43.065 --> 00:40:46.068
Perhaps. you know. we should
talk this through first.

565
00:40:46.152 --> 00:40:47.695
What is there to talk through?

566
00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:49.905
We cut our binds. break free.

567
00:40:49.989 --> 00:40:51.115
Yes. okay. Then what?

568
00:40:51.198 --> 00:40:53.159
- Then you take him out.
- Take him out?

569
00:40:53.242 --> 00:40:55.077
You know karate. You said
you were a black belt.

570
00:40:55.161 --> 00:40:57.037
We're 10.000 feet in the air. Joyce.

571
00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:59.415
I take him. who flies this plane?

572
00:40:59.498 --> 00:41:01.417
All right. so don't knock him out.

573
00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.752
Just get his gun and
make him turn us around.

574
00:41:03.836 --> 00:41:05.546
Get his gun. Just like that. huh?

575
00:41:05.629 --> 00:41:08.507
- Is black not the highest color?
- Yes.

576
00:41:08.591 --> 00:41:11.385
- It's just...
- Just what?

577
00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:14.388
I've never fought in a
real-world scenario. okay?

578
00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:16.849
I've only sparred with
the other students.

579
00:41:17.433 --> 00:41:18.433
How old?

580
00:41:18.476 --> 00:41:20.561
It doesn't go younger than 13.

581
00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:21.937
Thirteen?

582
00:41:22.021 --> 00:41:24.648
But Jeremiah is 16.

583
00:41:24.732 --> 00:41:26.484
Almost. His birthday is next month.

584
00:41:26.567 --> 00:41:28.944
And... And Jeremiah
is a ferocious fighter.

585
00:41:29.028 --> 00:41:31.363
Lightning fast. Very skilled.

586
00:41:33.199 --> 00:41:34.241
And I beat him.

587
00:41:35.075 --> 00:41:36.076
That one time.

588
00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:40.414
And certainly Yuri is not
trained or skilled like Jeremiah.

589
00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:42.290
So. yes.

590
00:41:42.791 --> 00:41:43.918
Yes. you're right.

591
00:41:44.502 --> 00:41:46.003
I can defeat Yuri.

592
00:41:46.086 --> 00:41:47.379
Absolutely.

593
00:41:49.048 --> 00:41:51.383
Thank you for talking it
through. I feel much better now.

594
00:41:51.467 --> 00:41:52.927
Yeah.

595
00:42:24.583 --> 00:42:25.584
No.

596
00:42:40.766 --> 00:42:41.892
Well. well.

597
00:42:42.851 --> 00:42:45.062
Look who finally decided to join us.

598
00:42:47.064 --> 00:42:48.983
Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.

599
00:42:55.614 --> 00:42:57.074
Stop this!

600
00:42:57.157 --> 00:42:58.659
Let me out!

601
00:43:35.571 --> 00:43:37.698
In 1786.

602
00:43:37.781 --> 00:43:41.035
Nicolas Dalayrac wrote
an opera called Nina.

603
00:43:43.204 --> 00:43:44.204
Papa.

604
00:43:44.204 --> 00:43:47.875
It's the story about a young woman
whose lover was killed in a duel.

605
00:43:47.958 --> 00:43:51.462
Nina was so traumatized
that she buried the memory.

606
00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:55.090
It was as if it never happened.

607
00:43:55.174 --> 00:43:58.010
Every day. she would
return to the train station

608
00:43:58.093 --> 00:43:59.887
to await her lover's return.

609
00:44:00.512 --> 00:44:02.348
A return that would never be.

610
00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:05.434
If only Nina could know the truth.

611
00:44:05.517 --> 00:44:07.936
This... This isn't real.

612
00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:09.021
No.

613
00:44:09.104 --> 00:44:10.397
But it once was.

614
00:44:11.649 --> 00:44:12.775
A memory.

615
00:44:12.858 --> 00:44:13.984
Very good.

616
00:44:16.095 --> 00:44:17.112
How?

617
00:44:17.112 --> 00:44:18.572
Never mind how.

618
00:44:18.656 --> 00:44:19.948
Let me out.

619
00:44:20.032 --> 00:44:21.325
I want out!

620
00:44:21.867 --> 00:44:23.327
I'm sorry. Eleven.

621
00:44:23.952 --> 00:44:25.663
You'll have to find your own way out.

622
00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.165
Leave your train station.

623
00:44:28.707 --> 00:44:29.958
Stop waiting.

624
00:44:30.042 --> 00:44:31.043
Focus.

625
00:44:31.877 --> 00:44:33.003
Listen.

626
00:44:33.087 --> 00:44:34.546
Remember.

627
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:36.131
I don't understand.

628
00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:39.968
I don't understand!

629
00:44:41.637 --> 00:44:42.637
Well. well.

630
00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.766
Look who finally decided to join us.

631
00:44:47.601 --> 00:44:49.436
Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.

632
00:44:51.647 --> 00:44:53.065
Focus.

633
00:44:53.148 --> 00:44:54.148
Listen.

634
00:44:54.191 --> 00:44:55.609
Remember.

635
00:44:59.321 --> 00:45:00.406
Well. well.

636
00:45:00.489 --> 00:45:03.742
Look who finally decided to join us.

637
00:45:03.826 --> 00:45:05.994
Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.

638
00:45:07.996 --> 00:45:11.500
I'm sorry. Am I... in trouble?

639
00:45:13.043 --> 00:45:14.043
Trouble?

640
00:45:14.962 --> 00:45:15.962
No.

641
00:45:16.422 --> 00:45:18.340
No. why do you think that?

642
00:45:18.424 --> 00:45:20.426
You're just missing out on all the fun.

643
00:45:21.301 --> 00:45:22.720
Training starts any minute.

644
00:45:22.803 --> 00:45:24.054
Okay.

645
00:45:25.931 --> 00:45:26.931
Hey.

646
00:45:27.433 --> 00:45:29.601
There's nothing to be nervous about.

647
00:45:29.685 --> 00:45:31.603
You're going to do great today.

648
00:45:32.396 --> 00:45:33.522
I just know it.

649
00:45:40.863 --> 00:45:43.824
- Good morning. children.
- Good morning. Papa.

650
00:45:44.658 --> 00:45:46.160
How are we feeling today?

651
00:45:46.243 --> 00:45:47.828
Good. Papa.

652
00:45:48.454 --> 00:45:49.663
Good.

653
00:45:49.747 --> 00:45:50.873
Number Twelve.

654
00:45:50.956 --> 00:45:53.125
Would you be so kind and open the door?

655
00:45:53.667 --> 00:45:54.835
Yes. Papa.

656
00:45:55.961 --> 00:45:57.296
Please. follow me.

657
00:46:12.186 --> 00:46:14.313
- How's she doing?
- Very well.

658
00:46:14.396 --> 00:46:15.606
She's swimming now.

659
00:46:15.689 --> 00:46:18.567
Good. 'Cause I just got
off the phone with Stinson.

660
00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:21.320
We don't have much time.

661
00:46:22.029 --> 00:46:24.323
Well then. she'll just
have to swim faster.

662
00:46:57.564 --> 00:47:00.859
- There's one. Argyle. slow down.
- There's one what?

663
00:47:00.943 --> 00:47:02.528
- Slow down.
- Stop barking orders.

664
00:47:02.611 --> 00:47:04.738
Argyle! Slow down!

665
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.741
- Whoa!
- Christ!

666
00:47:09.409 --> 00:47:14.498
202-968-6161.

667
00:47:17.376 --> 00:47:19.336
Is it ringing?

668
00:47:19.419 --> 00:47:21.672
No. it's just making a
bunch of weird noises.

669
00:47:22.422 --> 00:47:23.422
Busy?

670
00:47:24.466 --> 00:47:26.802
Listen to this.

671
00:47:26.885 --> 00:47:28.345
That remind you of anything?

672
00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:29.972
WarGames.

673
00:47:30.848 --> 00:47:31.848
What?

674
00:47:34.184 --> 00:47:36.311
Oh my God. we're not calling a phone.

675
00:47:37.229 --> 00:47:38.730
We're calling a computer.

676
00:47:40.649 --> 00:47:43.735
I don't know if Nina's a computer
like Joshua or Owens' lab.

677
00:47:43.819 --> 00:47:46.822
but Unknown Hero Agent Man gave
us access to it for a reason.

678
00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:51.034
We just need to find the computer.
We find Owens. then warn him.

679
00:47:51.118 --> 00:47:52.327
Then we warn Eleven.

680
00:47:52.411 --> 00:47:53.495
I just need a hacker.

681
00:47:53.579 --> 00:47:55.330
The only hacker that I know lives...

682
00:47:56.648 --> 00:47:57.708
in Utah.

683
00:47:57.708 --> 00:48:00.002
- Wait. Utah?
- Salt Lake City. to be specific.

684
00:48:00.085 --> 00:48:01.169
Oh my God.

685
00:48:02.613 --> 00:48:03.630
Oh my God.

686
00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:05.048
What? Why "Oh my God"?

687
00:48:05.674 --> 00:48:07.467
♪ Turn around ♪

688
00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:10.387
- ♪ Look at what you see ♪
- Oh no.

689
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:13.140
NeverEnding Story. That
scared the shit out of me.

690
00:48:13.223 --> 00:48:16.435
The Nothing. man? That's some
proper existential shit. dude.

691
00:48:16.518 --> 00:48:18.103
You can't be serious.

692
00:48:18.186 --> 00:48:20.397
If we take the I-15 north.
we'll get there by morning.

693
00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.481
Oh. you're serious.

694
00:48:21.565 --> 00:48:24.818
I know it sounds insane. but
Suzie saved the world last year.

695
00:48:25.527 --> 00:48:26.945
Maybe she can save it again.

696
00:48:58.602 --> 00:49:00.062
Shit. Shit.

697
00:49:06.068 --> 00:49:07.694
Looks like Rick's had company.

698
00:49:36.473 --> 00:49:37.473
It's him.

699
00:49:37.933 --> 00:49:39.351
Hey. Dustin.

700
00:49:39.434 --> 00:49:40.434
You there?

701
00:49:40.477 --> 00:49:42.270
It's Eddie. You remember me. right?

702
00:49:42.354 --> 00:49:44.685
Hey. if anyone's there.

703
00:49:44.686 --> 00:49:46.149
I really think I might be
in a bit of trouble here.

704
00:49:46.233 --> 00:49:47.818
Okay? Wheeler?

705
00:49:49.152 --> 00:49:50.152
Anybody?!

706
00:49:57.244 --> 00:49:59.371
Hey. uh. Henderson?

707
00:50:00.939 --> 00:50:01.957
Yeah?

708
00:50:01.957 --> 00:50:03.166
Could you maybe. uh.

709
00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:07.713
clarify what sort of clues we're
supposed to be looking for here?

710
00:50:09.715 --> 00:50:12.592
"The world is full of obvious things

711
00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:15.762
which nobody by any
chance ever observes."

712
00:50:18.765 --> 00:50:20.350
Sherlock Holmes.

713
00:50:23.061 --> 00:50:24.062
That's great.

714
00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:26.273
Thanks. That's great.

715
00:50:26.356 --> 00:50:27.356
Really helpful.

716
00:50:27.774 --> 00:50:28.774
Sherlock...

717
00:50:59.347 --> 00:51:00.390
Whoa. whoa.

718
00:51:00.474 --> 00:51:02.642
- What's wrong?
- There was a spider.

719
00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:04.686
- What?
- It's a black widow.

720
00:51:07.439 --> 00:51:09.232
- Okay.
- Don't go in there.

721
00:51:09.858 --> 00:51:11.401
Oh. oh.

722
00:51:11.485 --> 00:51:12.527
- Wait. just...
- What?

723
00:51:12.611 --> 00:51:14.946
- Something? Shit. Okay.
- Wait. Stop moving.

724
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:17.574
- Stop. I just... I got it. I got it.
- Thank you.

725
00:51:17.657 --> 00:51:19.993
If there's a spider.
you're never gonna find it

726
00:51:20.077 --> 00:51:21.912
till it lays eggs and
the babies spill out.

727
00:51:21.995 --> 00:51:24.039
What's wrong with you?

728
00:51:24.122 --> 00:51:25.332
Robin. seriously.

729
00:51:26.458 --> 00:51:27.542
She's got problems.

730
00:51:27.626 --> 00:51:30.420
- Tell me about it.
- It's cool you two are friends now.

731
00:51:31.004 --> 00:51:34.257
Maybe after we find Vecna. kill
him. save the world and stuff.

732
00:51:34.341 --> 00:51:35.801
maybe we can all go out.

733
00:51:36.551 --> 00:51:39.554
You know? Me. you. Robin.
Jonathan. when he's back.

734
00:51:40.722 --> 00:51:43.892
It's not like we're dating. Me
and Robin. Not like we're dating.

735
00:51:43.975 --> 00:51:47.312
- She told you? That we're not?
- Yes. She made that very clear.

736
00:51:47.395 --> 00:51:49.272
Platonic with a capital P.

737
00:51:49.356 --> 00:51:50.690
Yep. Thank you.

738
00:51:51.441 --> 00:51:52.441
I mean...

739
00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:54.611
I would date her. It's just...

740
00:51:54.694 --> 00:51:57.280
She's... We're just...
Never mind. We're friends.

741
00:51:57.364 --> 00:51:58.698
- Just friends.
- Right. Right.

742
00:52:00.242 --> 00:52:01.618
Okay. All better.

743
00:52:02.494 --> 00:52:03.787
Great. Thanks.

744
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:05.330
Well...

745
00:52:07.124 --> 00:52:08.124
Great. Um...

746
00:52:11.294 --> 00:52:14.798
Guess we should. uh. get
back to the investigation.

747
00:52:16.508 --> 00:52:20.804
"The obvious things are
not what people observe."

748
00:52:20.887 --> 00:52:22.430
Or... "Do... Don't observe."

749
00:52:22.514 --> 00:52:23.515
Or...

750
00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:27.936
Sherlock Holmes.

751
00:52:34.317 --> 00:52:35.317
What?

752
00:52:52.752 --> 00:52:54.379
I wish we had a longer loop.

753
00:52:54.462 --> 00:52:56.131
Forty-six minutes isn't bad.

754
00:52:57.507 --> 00:52:59.634
I think there are bigger concerns.

755
00:52:59.718 --> 00:53:00.886
Like...

756
00:53:00.969 --> 00:53:04.681
What if. by listening to this
over and over. I get sick of it.

757
00:53:04.764 --> 00:53:07.017
and suddenly it's not
my favorite anymore?

758
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:09.401
Will it still work? Or
will Kate Bush. like.

759
00:53:09.402 --> 00:53:11.730
lose her magic power or something?

760
00:53:11.813 --> 00:53:13.315
Kate Bush? Never.

761
00:53:13.398 --> 00:53:14.858
You're a Kate Bush fan?

762
00:53:14.941 --> 00:53:17.194
Uh. yeah. Now I am.

763
00:53:17.277 --> 00:53:19.237
- Really?
- Yeah. mega-fan.

764
00:53:19.321 --> 00:53:20.572
She... She saved your life.

765
00:53:21.406 --> 00:53:24.618
Besides. we're hot on this creep's
trail. We're gonna find Vecna

766
00:53:24.701 --> 00:53:25.945
and kill him before he even thinks

767
00:53:25.946 --> 00:53:28.413
about messing with you again. All right?

768
00:53:29.331 --> 00:53:32.209
In fact. I bet if we hit these
suckers in the right combo.

769
00:53:32.292 --> 00:53:35.170
we might just open a
door to his secret lair.

770
00:53:37.297 --> 00:53:38.882
Voilà.

771
00:53:38.965 --> 00:53:40.217
You're such a dork.

772
00:53:40.967 --> 00:53:43.345
I thought you were. like.
one of the cool kids now.

773
00:53:44.304 --> 00:53:46.139
I'm not cool?

774
00:53:47.891 --> 00:53:49.184
I've really missed that.

775
00:53:49.935 --> 00:53:50.935
Missed what?

776
00:53:52.896 --> 00:53:53.896
Your laugh.

777
00:53:58.860 --> 00:53:59.860
All done.

778
00:54:00.779 --> 00:54:02.113
Work your magic. Kate.

779
00:54:09.037 --> 00:54:11.164
I promise I'm gonna
stop asking this. but...

780
00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:13.917
... you're seeing that. right?

781
00:54:15.043 --> 00:54:16.086
Yeah.

782
00:54:20.966 --> 00:54:22.759
♪ Feel how it feels ♪

783
00:54:22.842 --> 00:54:24.135
♪ Yeah. yeah. yeah ♪

784
00:54:24.219 --> 00:54:26.221
♪ Do you want to know... ♪

785
00:54:26.304 --> 00:54:27.304
Look.

786
00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:06.720
Stop.

787
00:55:09.306 --> 00:55:10.473
Very good. Two.

788
00:55:11.057 --> 00:55:12.100
Very good.

789
00:55:15.687 --> 00:55:16.771
Now.

790
00:55:16.855 --> 00:55:19.607
which brave soul

791
00:55:19.691 --> 00:55:21.234
would like to follow that?

792
00:55:21.776 --> 00:55:22.776
Hmm?

793
00:55:22.777 --> 00:55:25.989
- Hmm?
- Me. Me. Me.

794
00:55:26.072 --> 00:55:30.535
Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me.

795
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:33.330
Eleven?

796
00:55:53.141 --> 00:55:54.642
Remember to stay focused.

797
00:55:55.602 --> 00:55:56.728
Find the energy.

798
00:55:57.979 --> 00:55:58.980
Feel it.

799
00:56:30.887 --> 00:56:32.931
Why does he waste so much time with her?

800
00:56:33.556 --> 00:56:34.556
Hey.

801
00:56:35.642 --> 00:56:36.893
Quiet.

802
00:56:41.022 --> 00:56:42.565
They're laughing.

803
00:56:43.066 --> 00:56:44.066
At you.

804
00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:46.986
They think you're weak.

805
00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:49.739
Show them. Eleven.

806
00:56:51.266 --> 00:56:52.283
Show them.

807
00:56:59.541 --> 00:57:00.667
Good.

808
00:57:01.501 --> 00:57:03.002
Now make it move.

809
00:57:22.439 --> 00:57:23.606
Waste of time.

810
00:58:11.279 --> 00:58:14.032
- What is happening?
- She's going into arrest.

811
00:58:14.115 --> 00:58:16.409
Okay. that's enough. Pull her out.

812
00:58:17.994 --> 00:58:19.162
Pull her out!

813
00:58:46.064 --> 00:58:48.775
Naughty. naughty bird.

814
00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:51.444
Did you fall out of your nest?

815
00:58:52.070 --> 00:58:53.863
Where do you think you are going?

816
00:58:54.472 --> 00:58:55.532
Come on.

817
00:58:55.532 --> 00:58:57.867
Be a good girl now and
get back to your place.

818
00:58:57.951 --> 00:59:00.453
Or what? Are you gonna shoot me?

819
00:59:01.079 --> 00:59:03.248
I... I don't think the
KGB would like that.

820
00:59:03.331 --> 00:59:04.958
You're right. I cannot kill you.

821
00:59:05.041 --> 00:59:08.711
But KGB didn't specify
condition you must arrive in.

822
00:59:08.795 --> 00:59:11.005
You are fragile cargo.

823
00:59:11.089 --> 00:59:12.966
You can still break.

824
00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:15.969
Not if I break you first.

825
00:59:21.015 --> 00:59:22.850
My fingers are like arrows.

826
00:59:23.518 --> 00:59:25.603
My arms. like iron.

827
00:59:25.687 --> 00:59:28.106
My feet. like spears.

828
00:59:29.399 --> 00:59:30.400
Resist.

829
00:59:31.025 --> 00:59:32.277
and I will end you.

830
00:59:33.319 --> 00:59:35.113
But turn this plane around.

831
00:59:35.196 --> 00:59:37.991
and I will spare your life.

832
00:59:49.085 --> 00:59:50.169
Kiai!

833
01:00:13.526 --> 01:00:15.737
Ah! Kiai!

834
01:00:45.683 --> 01:00:47.435
Let him go!

835
01:00:47.518 --> 01:00:49.270
Let him go!

836
01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:11.959
My fingers are like arrows.

837
01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:14.921
My arms. like iron!

838
01:01:15.755 --> 01:01:20.051
My feet. like spears!

839
01:01:20.718 --> 01:01:21.719
Kiai!

840
01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:24.764
Kiai!

841
01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:29.602
What did you do?

842
01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:31.562
What?

843
01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:33.731
I said. "Don't knock him out."

844
01:01:43.783 --> 01:01:46.494
- I thought you didn't know how to fly!
- I don't!

845
01:02:02.969 --> 01:02:05.513
Pull up! Pull up!

846
01:02:05.596 --> 01:02:08.224
I am pulling up!

847
01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:00.693
It's like the Christmas lights.

848
01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:02.028
The Christmas lights?

849
01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:05.031
Yeah. when Will was in the Upside Down.

850
01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:08.201
the lights... came to life.

851
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:09.994
Vecna's here.

852
01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:12.329
In this house.

853
01:03:13.956 --> 01:03:15.583
Just on the other side.

854
01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:21.297
I think he just left the room.

855
01:03:23.508 --> 01:03:24.592
Did he hear us?

856
01:03:25.384 --> 01:03:26.552
Can he see us?

857
01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:27.678
Headphones.

858
01:03:28.721 --> 01:03:29.722
Wait. wait.

859
01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:32.391
Everyone. turn off your
flashlights and spread out.

860
01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:35.686
We're not gonna be able to see if
we turn off our flash... lights.

861
01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:39.023
Jesus Christ.

862
01:03:56.958 --> 01:03:58.292
I got him!

863
01:03:58.376 --> 01:03:59.376
Got him!

864
01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:01.838
I got him.

865
01:04:03.464 --> 01:04:04.674
I... I had him.

866
01:04:04.757 --> 01:04:06.175
Oh. whoa.

867
01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:10.137
Oh. I think he's moving.
He's moving. He's moving.

868
01:04:22.149 --> 01:04:23.192
Shit.

869
01:04:23.276 --> 01:04:24.360
I lost him.

870
01:04:24.443 --> 01:04:25.528
No. you didn't.

871
01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:42.753
It's an attic. Of course it's an attic.

872
01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:48.009
Hold up. guys. What if
he's leading us into a trap?

873
01:04:48.593 --> 01:04:50.261
Guys. guys.

874
01:04:50.344 --> 01:04:52.471
Shit. Shit. shit. shit. shit.

875
01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:02.607
Dude. he's not here. seriously.

876
01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:04.066
Shut up and keep looking.

877
01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:20.625
Dustin?

878
01:05:20.708 --> 01:05:22.585
Please. Are... Are you there?

879
01:05:25.296 --> 01:05:26.296
Never mind.

880
01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:44.649
Come with me.

881
01:06:00.414 --> 01:06:01.414
Holy shit.

882
01:06:01.832 --> 01:06:02.832
Hey. freak!

883
01:06:04.585 --> 01:06:06.712
- Where do you think you're going?
- Shit.

884
01:06:09.507 --> 01:06:11.342
Come on!

885
01:06:11.425 --> 01:06:14.929
- Just come on...
- You scared of some water? Let's go!

886
01:06:15.012 --> 01:06:17.682
... you piece of shit!

887
01:06:17.765 --> 01:06:20.518
Come on. Gotta help me out here. man.

888
01:06:21.102 --> 01:06:22.186
Come on.

889
01:06:22.269 --> 01:06:23.646
Come on. you piece of shit!

890
01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:25.606
Come on!

891
01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:27.400
Goddamn it!

892
01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:31.070
Nope? Okay. All right. Okay.

893
01:06:36.951 --> 01:06:38.077
Shit. Shit.

894
01:06:56.721 --> 01:06:57.721
Flashlights.

895
01:07:07.773 --> 01:07:09.442
Okay. what's happening?

896
01:08:01.452 --> 01:08:04.121
Hey. stay back. man! Stay back!

897
01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:05.830
Stay back!

898
01:08:06.373 --> 01:08:07.833
Come on. We almost have him.

899
01:08:10.544 --> 01:08:11.587
Hey. Patrick.

900
01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:13.588
Patrick!

901
01:08:14.381 --> 01:08:15.382
Patrick!

902
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:21.222
Patrick.

903
01:08:22.431 --> 01:08:23.432
Hey. Patrick.

904
01:08:24.016 --> 01:08:25.017
Hey. Patrick.

905
01:08:25.918 --> 01:08:26.936
Patrick!

906
01:08:58.259 --> 01:08:59.760
Air.

907
01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:01.679
Get her some air. for Christ's sake.

908
01:09:02.263 --> 01:09:04.306
It's okay. It will take time to adjust.

909
01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:06.350
But you're safe now. hmm?

910
01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:29.456
Giving us quite the workout.
You really wanna do this again?

911
01:09:31.625 --> 01:09:34.670
No! No! No!

912
01:09:58.027 --> 01:09:59.486
Remarkable.

913
01:10:11.999 --> 01:10:13.417
Stay away.

914
01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:23.052
I said. stay away!

915
01:10:30.142 --> 01:10:32.311
You didn't think it would be that easy.

916
01:10:32.811 --> 01:10:33.812

917
01:10:37.441 --> 01:10:38.609
I don't understand.

918
01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:41.237
I do.

919
01:11:15.562 --> 01:11:16.562
Papa?

920
01:11:18.190 --> 01:11:19.400
