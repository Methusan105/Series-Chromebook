2
00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:32.157
Where is he?

3
00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.432
Where was Eddie when that happened?

4
00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:59.100
Wha...

5
00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:01.102
Wait. what?

6
00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:02.186
Eddie.

7
00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:04.939
Where was Eddie when you saw this?

8
00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:07.609
He... He was in the...

9
00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:09.277
... in the boat. like I said.

10
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.360
Right.

11
00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:12.697
Right. Right.

12
00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:15.658
But then. uh...

13
00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:18.536
... who lifted Patrick out the water?

14
00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:22.623
What...

15
00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.460
You're not listening to me.

16
00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:29.506
- Why aren't you listening to me?
- Jason. we are listening.

17
00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:31.925
No. you're not. You're not.

18
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:33.051
Eddie. he's...

19
00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:35.385
Eddie is a vessel.

20
00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.180
Just a vessel.

21
00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:38.263
A vessel?

22
00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.264
For Satan.

23
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.977
He's made a pact with the
devil. Now he has his powers.

24
00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:50.777
You don't believe me.

25
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:52.529
We're just. uh.

26
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.615
processing all of
this. that's all. Okay?

27
00:01:56.157 --> 00:01:57.157
Yeah.

28
00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:09.003
How do you expect to stop the devil
if you don't believe he's real?

29
00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:23.388
I can make it stop.

30
00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:26.599
I can make the pain end.

31
00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:31.980
Where's the girl?

32
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.816
I told you.

33
00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:37.901
I don't...

34
00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:39.654
I don't... I don't know.

35
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.491
There are two proposed
explanations for what is happening.

36
00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:45.952
Explanation one.

37
00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:49.497
an invisible boogeyman
from another dimension

38
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.291
is slaughtering these kids.

39
00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:53.918
Explanation two.

40
00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.629
Dr. Brenner's special little
pet has gone rogue again

41
00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:58.673
and he and his lackeys

42
00:04:58.756 --> 00:05:00.758
are now seeking to cover it up.

43
00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:05.305
Perhaps in the hopes of selling
their pet to the Soviets.

44
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:08.181
Now.

45
00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:12.603
which explanation
sounds plausible to you?

46
00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:13.688
Hmm?

47
00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:17.025
I don't know.

48
00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:20.737
There's still a chance to
redeem yourself. Mr. Wallace.

49
00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.408
Where is she?

50
00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.379
No!

51
00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:40.423
No! No!

52
00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:43.885
No!

53
00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:00.860
Do you know what happens
when someone has a stroke?

54
00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:05.114
The blood supply to
the brain is cut off.

55
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.160
It scrambles the signals in the
brain to the point where the mind

56
00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:10.953
can forget how to do things.

57
00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:13.664
To eat. To speak.

58
00:06:14.107 --> 00:06:15.124
To walk.

59
00:06:15.124 --> 00:06:16.918
When you were attacked last year.

60
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:20.171
I believe that your signals were
scrambled in much the same way.

61
00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:25.093
But just as a stroke victim
can learn to walk again.

62
00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:28.304
I believe you. too. can
return to your full power.

63
00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:34.727
Your abilities are still in here.

64
00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.896
You just need to remember.

65
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.195
Everything that took place in my lab

66
00:06:44.278 --> 00:06:46.114
was captured on videotape.

67
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:50.743
Every success and every failure.

68
00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:55.581
It's important for you
to not just see your past.

69
00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:58.626
but to fully re-experience it.

70
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.421
In doing so. I believe we can

71
00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.297
repair your broken signals.

72
00:07:04.715 --> 00:07:08.052
As we saw tonight. that
process has already begun.

73
00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:16.602
If this all happened.

74
00:07:17.895 --> 00:07:19.230
why don't I remember?

75
00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:21.649
Because you do not want to.

76
00:07:23.067 --> 00:07:27.029
Our brains have a
defense mechanism in place

77
00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:30.032
to protect it from bad memories.

78
00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:31.993
From trauma.

79
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.371
You buried these memories long ago.

80
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.250
Papa.

81
00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:43.880
When I was in there.

82
00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:46.591
I saw something.

83
00:07:48.342 --> 00:07:49.760
There was blood.

84
00:07:52.054 --> 00:07:53.181
So much blood.

85
00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:56.767
That was another memory.

86
00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:59.020
a... a more powerful one.

87
00:07:59.687 --> 00:08:01.355
invading from your subconscious.

88
00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:04.358
You have demons. Eleven.

89
00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:07.111
You have demons in your past.

90
00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:11.073
That is why we must proceed carefully.

91
00:08:12.533 --> 00:08:14.243
One step at a time.

92
00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:16.829
one memory at a time.

93
00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:19.790
If we go too fast.

94
00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:22.627
I'm afraid you could
become lost in the darkness.

95
00:08:28.257 --> 00:08:29.592
And if you are lost...

96
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.138
so are we all.

97
00:08:58.246 --> 00:08:59.539
Oh.

98
00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:02.041
Hey. Eric. I'm taking five.

99
00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:03.751
You just took five.

100
00:09:03.834 --> 00:09:06.921
Yeah. well. tell Milo to take
it easy on the onions next time.

101
00:09:27.024 --> 00:09:29.026
Not to be a wimp. but
can I sit in the car?

102
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.779
'Cause this is gonna
totally and royally suck.

103
00:09:31.862 --> 00:09:33.114
It'll be fine.

104
00:09:33.197 --> 00:09:36.242
I can't stand to see those dull
eyes of Eddie's break again.

105
00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:37.702
I really. really can't.

106
00:09:37.785 --> 00:09:40.121
At least he can drink
himself into feeling better.

107
00:09:40.204 --> 00:09:41.414
That's what my mom does.

108
00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:43.040
Why don't we give it a trial?

109
00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:45.793
"Hey. Eddie. Uh. good
news first this time."

110
00:09:45.876 --> 00:09:47.655
"We got you some
Dustin-approved junk food

111
00:09:47.656 --> 00:09:49.130
and that six-pack you requested."

112
00:09:49.213 --> 00:09:50.840
"Oh yeah. and we found Vecna."

113
00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:54.927
"Bad news is that he's in that
other. darker. much scarier dimension.

114
00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:57.305
and the gate's closed. so we
have no way of getting to him."

115
00:09:57.388 --> 00:10:00.349
"He's entirely shut off to us.
so basically you're screwed."

116
00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:02.560
"And. no. I know you
were already screwed.

117
00:10:02.643 --> 00:10:05.313
but now you're doubly. triply screwed."

118
00:10:05.396 --> 00:10:07.315
Wait. Maybe we don't put it like that.

119
00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:09.775
"We're one step closer
to finding Vecna."

120
00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:11.861
That's what we say.
That's what's important.

121
00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:14.780
See. Robin? Positive spin
can make all the difference.

122
00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:17.408
- Uh-huh.
- Oh shit.

123
00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:27.710
Nothing to see.

124
00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:32.131
Just step back a little.

125
00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:33.215
All right?

126
00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:35.009
- This way.
- As many of you know.

127
00:10:35.092 --> 00:10:37.887
the Roane County line received a call

128
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.348
a little after midnight...

129
00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:42.391
... reporting a homicide
here on the lake.

130
00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:45.561
Officer Callahan here and myself

131
00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:48.022
arrived first on the scene.

132
00:10:48.105 --> 00:10:50.691
We made our way to the
shore of Lover's Lake.

133
00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:53.778
about ten yards from that
house you see behind me.

134
00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.947
It was there that we found the victim.

135
00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.409
an 18-year-old senior
from Hawkins High.

136
00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:02.078
Patrick McKinney.

137
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.705
His limbs...

138
00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:06.374
- Oh my God.
- ... his body. it was disfigured...

139
00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:09.877
What are we even doing?
I mean. where is the FBI?

140
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.464
- There was an eyewitness on the scene...
- That's what I want to know.

141
00:11:13.547 --> 00:11:15.383
We got a serial killer on the loose.

142
00:11:15.466 --> 00:11:18.636
We have also identified
a person of interest.

143
00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:20.971
Eddie Munson.

144
00:11:21.055 --> 00:11:23.265
We encourage anyone with information

145
00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:24.975
- to please come forward.
- Oh man.

146
00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:28.020
This is not good. Really not good.

147
00:11:28.022 --> 00:11:29.595
You've got a lot of questions.

148
00:11:29.596 --> 00:11:31.732
and I'm going to
answer as many as I can.

149
00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.901
Two o'clock at town hall.

150
00:11:33.984 --> 00:11:37.363
where anyone from the Hawkins
community is welcome. But right now.

151
00:11:37.446 --> 00:11:40.282
I've got work to do. and I
appreciate your understanding.

152
00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:42.451
Is Eddie still in Hawkins?

153
00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:45.037
Dustin. can you hear me? Wheeler?

154
00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:47.748
Eddie. Holy shit.

155
00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:48.832
Are you okay?

156
00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:53.087
Nah. man. Pretty... Pretty
goddamn far from okay.

157
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.839
- Where is he?
- Where are you?

158
00:11:54.922 --> 00:11:57.133
- Skull Rock. Do you know it?
- Uh. yeah.

159
00:11:57.216 --> 00:12:00.845
- That's near Cornwallis and...
- Garrett. yeah. I know where that is.

160
00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:03.305
Hold tight. We're coming. We're coming.

161
00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:22.992
I can't feel my butt.

162
00:12:24.368 --> 00:12:25.494
Can't feel my butt.

163
00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.037
Can you guys feel your butts?

164
00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:28.456
I can feel my butt.

165
00:12:28.956 --> 00:12:31.417
Everyone needs to be on
their best behavior. okay?

166
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.502
Why are you looking at
me when you say that?

167
00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.921
- I didn't.
- They're just really religious.

168
00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:38.007
Yeah. and I'm super spiritual. dude.

169
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:41.635
Yeah. I think they're spiritual
too. Just in a different way.

170
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.642
Oh. Hey.

171
00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:50.186
Is Suzie here?

172
00:12:52.229 --> 00:12:54.064
Ow!

173
00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:04.074
Away. you starveling!

174
00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:07.411
You elf-skin! You dried neat's tongue!

175
00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:09.872
This is my kind of party.

176
00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:11.207
I've been bitten.

177
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.375
Help! Help!

178
00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:15.836
- Beautiful performance.
- Excuse me.

179
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.713
Uh. hey. we're looking for Suzie.

180
00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:21.926
Can you not see

181
00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:23.803
that we are filming?

182
00:13:25.137 --> 00:13:26.180
Come on.

183
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.267
All right. stay in it.
Tabitha. Stay in it.

184
00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:34.605
Hi. we're looking for Suzie.

185
00:13:34.688 --> 00:13:36.398
Don't know. don't care.

186
00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:40.528
That's too much salt. Peter.
Father's kidneys! Father's kidneys!

187
00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:43.489
Cornelius!

188
00:13:44.198 --> 00:13:46.075
How many times do I have to tell you?

189
00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:47.618
That is not a toy.

190
00:13:47.701 --> 00:13:49.495
Come on.

191
00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.045
You make another escape.

192
00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:00.381
I'm getting Father.

193
00:14:04.885 --> 00:14:06.178
Who the hell are you?

194
00:14:08.597 --> 00:14:09.597
Argyle.

195
00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:12.977
Uh. and you are?

196
00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:15.187
Eden.

197
00:14:15.187 --> 00:14:17.106
- Like the garden.
- Wow.

198
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:19.275
- We're looking for Suzie.
- Do you know where she is?

199
00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:21.360
Third floor. second door on your left.

200
00:14:21.443 --> 00:14:23.836
You make sure to give
that selfish four-eyed shit

201
00:14:23.837 --> 00:14:25.823
a nice little shove for me.

202
00:14:25.906 --> 00:14:27.449
Absolutely.

203
00:14:28.075 --> 00:14:29.075
Eden. I...

204
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.580
I will shove her for you. I will...

205
00:14:33.163 --> 00:14:34.874
I will do anything for you.

206
00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:38.586
Well. great. she's not here.

207
00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:43.799
"Give her a shove."

208
00:14:46.093 --> 00:14:47.469
- Suzie!
- Yeah?

209
00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:50.139
Who the heck are you?

210
00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:52.099
And what are you doing in my room?

211
00:14:52.182 --> 00:14:54.435
- Sorry. that's... that's fair.
- No. listen.

212
00:14:54.518 --> 00:14:56.270
- We're Dustin's friends.
- Yeah.

213
00:14:56.353 --> 00:14:57.897
We really need your help.

214
00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.335
You said an hour.

215
00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:20.753
I underestimated.

216
00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:23.255
I thought you were dead.

217
00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:24.757
Might as well be.

218
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.218
We are truly in hell if hell froze over.

219
00:15:30.846 --> 00:15:34.308
There's nothing south. but two
miles north I saw some smoke.

220
00:15:34.391 --> 00:15:35.768
Could be a town. a house.

221
00:15:35.851 --> 00:15:38.687
Maybe somebody there knows
where we can find this prison.

222
00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:40.773
The top-secret prison.

223
00:15:40.856 --> 00:15:41.857
Really?

224
00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:42.941
Right.

225
00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:46.445
Any luck with our friend?

226
00:15:46.528 --> 00:15:47.947
What do you think?

227
00:15:53.577 --> 00:15:54.577
Hey!

228
00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:56.330
Dipshit!

229
00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:04.213
We're outta here. Last chance.

230
00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:06.840
Where's the prison?

231
00:16:06.924 --> 00:16:08.050
I told you.

232
00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:10.386
Yuri will help you for the right price.

233
00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:12.471
I told you. we're wasting our time.

234
00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:15.557
- Half.
- What?

235
00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:18.310
- What?
- You heard me. you stubborn bastard.

236
00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:19.478
Half the reward.

237
00:16:19.561 --> 00:16:20.813
Twenty thousand.

238
00:16:20.896 --> 00:16:22.856
- Thirty thousand.
- Twenty-two.

239
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.024
Twenty-five.

240
00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:27.027
All right.

241
00:16:28.487 --> 00:16:31.407
Looks like we got ourselves

242
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.534
a moron!

243
00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:36.662
You thought I was serious?

244
00:16:36.745 --> 00:16:38.831
He thought I was serious.

245
00:16:38.914 --> 00:16:41.041
I got you! I got you good!

246
00:16:43.293 --> 00:16:46.046
There's only one thing you
get if you take this deal.

247
00:16:46.588 --> 00:16:48.007
You get to live.

248
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.967
You are not killer.

249
00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.385
Oh. you're right.

250
00:16:51.468 --> 00:16:52.468
He's not a killer.

251
00:16:52.469 --> 00:16:53.469
No.

252
00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:55.431
Thing is. we don't need to kill you.

253
00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:57.433
We can just leave you here.

254
00:16:57.516 --> 00:17:00.686
Because there's nothing for miles

255
00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:03.814
and no one will find you.

256
00:17:03.897 --> 00:17:05.190
No human. at least.

257
00:17:05.274 --> 00:17:07.860
- I saw tracks.
- Tracks.

258
00:17:07.943 --> 00:17:09.737
In the woods. Yuri.

259
00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:12.698
- Bears.
- Bears.

260
00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:15.075
Who knew you could see your own future?

261
00:17:15.659 --> 00:17:17.870
Shall we fly out of here. little bird?

262
00:17:17.953 --> 00:17:20.622
Uh. da. da.

263
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.499
Bye-bye. Yuri.

264
00:17:30.674 --> 00:17:31.674
Wait.

265
00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:35.971
You should go east. not north.

266
00:17:36.513 --> 00:17:40.225
My warehouse is there.
Supplies. guns. truck.

267
00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:42.853
We will need to reach
prison by nightfall

268
00:17:42.936 --> 00:17:44.938
if you hope to save your friend.

269
00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:47.775
That is. if he's not already dead.

270
00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.617
Out. Everyone out.

271
00:17:57.367 --> 00:17:59.620
Let's go! Move it!

272
00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:15.344
This is it. American.

273
00:18:15.427 --> 00:18:16.762
I hope you're ready.

274
00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:32.486
What are you all waiting for?

275
00:18:32.569 --> 00:18:33.570
Move!

276
00:18:34.613 --> 00:18:36.031
Let's go!

277
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.075
Move!

278
00:19:12.067 --> 00:19:13.944
Am I dreaming. American?

279
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:18.407
Or is this real?

280
00:19:32.629 --> 00:19:35.299
What is wrong with your American friend?

281
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.595
He has lost his spirit to live.

282
00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.139
And he is not my friend.

283
00:19:43.098 --> 00:19:45.475
Isn't that right. Cursed One?

284
00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:47.978
You have lost your spirit to live.

285
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:50.272
Yeah. Yeah. something like that.

286
00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:53.901
No...

287
00:19:57.946 --> 00:19:59.907
He is American after all.

288
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.660
Big talk. but weak inside.

289
00:20:04.661 --> 00:20:06.079
Tell him to eat.

290
00:20:07.414 --> 00:20:09.416
Or he endangers us all.

291
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.378
We have a big fight ahead of us.

292
00:20:13.962 --> 00:20:15.130
What are you talking about? Fight?

293
00:20:15.964 --> 00:20:19.134
I have been in this place one week.

294
00:20:20.969 --> 00:20:22.596
My first night.

295
00:20:22.679 --> 00:20:24.598
I saw six men enter this room.

296
00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:26.433
Six.

297
00:20:26.516 --> 00:20:28.101
Just like us.

298
00:20:28.644 --> 00:20:29.728
They came out

299
00:20:29.811 --> 00:20:34.358
happy and fat. faces
smothered in grease.

300
00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:38.987
But when night fell. they were
thrown into that pit out there.

301
00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:40.739
But not alone.

302
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:43.825
You heard those roars. yes?

303
00:20:46.954 --> 00:20:48.038
That is a monster.

304
00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:50.749
Not from this world.

305
00:20:54.836 --> 00:20:58.090
Thirty seconds it
took! Thirty seconds...

306
00:20:58.173 --> 00:20:59.883
And all six men...

307
00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:01.885
You speak no sense.

308
00:21:01.969 --> 00:21:04.638
If they plan to kill us tonight.
why waste this food on us?

309
00:21:04.721 --> 00:21:06.390
They want us strong.

310
00:21:06.473 --> 00:21:08.558
So we can fight it.

311
00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:10.852
To test its strength.

312
00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:13.105
To train this monster for war.

313
00:21:13.188 --> 00:21:16.566
But last week. the men
got their weapons...

314
00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:19.611
then scattered like fools.

315
00:21:20.153 --> 00:21:21.905
We stick together...

316
00:21:22.489 --> 00:21:23.782
Perhaps we stand a chance!

317
00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:26.410
Perhaps we live to see another day.

318
00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:30.872
Till tomorrow!

319
00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:33.458
Let me guess.

320
00:21:34.918 --> 00:21:35.919
This...

321
00:21:38.547 --> 00:21:40.340
... it's about nine feet tall?

322
00:21:41.091 --> 00:21:42.426
Thin. white skin?

323
00:21:43.093 --> 00:21:44.136
No face?

324
00:21:45.762 --> 00:21:46.847
No eyes?

325
00:21:47.931 --> 00:21:50.309
Come on. come on. come on. Translate!

326
00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:04.156
How do you know this?

327
00:22:05.073 --> 00:22:06.450
'Cause I've seen one.

328
00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:08.493
And I've fought one.

329
00:22:09.536 --> 00:22:11.371
And all your theories about it.

330
00:22:12.956 --> 00:22:14.041
they're all wrong.

331
00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:19.212
You know why they feed
captive predators live prey?

332
00:22:20.464 --> 00:22:24.676
Because if they don't. the predator
gets bored and it stops eating.

333
00:22:26.428 --> 00:22:28.472
It needs the thrill of the hunt.

334
00:22:31.808 --> 00:22:37.022
We're not here to train this
monster with swords and axes.

335
00:22:38.315 --> 00:22:39.941
We're here to entertain it.

336
00:22:41.818 --> 00:22:42.944
And this food...

337
00:22:45.614 --> 00:22:47.741
this food isn't to make us strong.

338
00:22:47.824 --> 00:22:51.161
It's to. uh. make us plump.

339
00:22:53.914 --> 00:22:56.650
So we're full of the
nutrients and protein

340
00:22:56.651 --> 00:22:58.251
that a growing monster might need.

341
00:23:03.673 --> 00:23:04.925
So eat up. boys.

342
00:23:05.717 --> 00:23:06.717
Enjoy.

343
00:23:08.053 --> 00:23:09.513
This is your last meal.

344
00:23:43.046 --> 00:23:44.756
Which number are you aiming for?

345
00:23:49.261 --> 00:23:50.261
Three.

346
00:23:56.101 --> 00:23:57.101
You know.

347
00:23:58.603 --> 00:23:59.688
sometimes

348
00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:03.358
it's helpful to take a
step away for a moment.

349
00:24:04.526 --> 00:24:05.735
Let the mind clear.

350
00:24:19.749 --> 00:24:21.084
Determined. aren't we?

351
00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:23.336
You know...

352
00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:27.048
... you remind me of someone.
Someone I used to know really well.

353
00:24:27.966 --> 00:24:29.509
Can you guess who that is?

354
00:24:39.644 --> 00:24:40.854
One?

355
00:24:43.398 --> 00:24:45.609
- Papa said that he doesn't...
- Exist? I know.

356
00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:52.616
But can I tell you a secret?

357
00:24:52.699 --> 00:24:53.950
Sometimes.

358
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.745
Papa doesn't tell the truth.

359
00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.123
I spent years with One.

360
00:25:01.291 --> 00:25:02.291
Right here.

361
00:25:03.418 --> 00:25:04.794
In this very room.

362
00:25:04.878 --> 00:25:05.921
Where is he?

363
00:25:07.172 --> 00:25:09.466
Maybe we'll save that
story for another day.

364
00:25:10.967 --> 00:25:13.094
It doesn't have a happy
ending. I'm afraid.

365
00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:15.555
But he was a lot like you.

366
00:25:15.639 --> 00:25:17.641
Everything was hard for him.

367
00:25:17.724 --> 00:25:21.228
Then. out of nowhere. he
walked in here and it was like

368
00:25:21.978 --> 00:25:23.355
something had changed.

369
00:25:24.773 --> 00:25:27.150
And I asked him what's
different. and he said...

370
00:25:29.986 --> 00:25:32.948
he said he had figured it out.

371
00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:36.576
He had found his strength
in a memory from his past.

372
00:25:38.036 --> 00:25:39.871
Something that made him sad.

373
00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:42.666
But also angry.

374
00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:45.042
Do you

375
00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:47.337
maybe have a memory like that?

376
00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:54.135
Do you remember the day a
strange woman came to see you?

377
00:25:55.929 --> 00:25:58.139
This would've been when
Eight was still here.

378
00:26:01.476 --> 00:26:02.769
The woman.

379
00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:06.231
she was calling a name to you.

380
00:26:06.856 --> 00:26:09.150
Jane. No! No!

381
00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:10.777
No! Jane!

382
00:26:11.653 --> 00:26:12.654
That

383
00:26:13.697 --> 00:26:14.948
was your mother.

384
00:26:17.617 --> 00:26:18.952
Mama is dead.

385
00:26:19.035 --> 00:26:20.870
She died making me.

386
00:26:20.954 --> 00:26:22.080
And who told you that?

387
00:26:22.163 --> 00:26:23.164
Papa.

388
00:26:27.752 --> 00:26:29.838
Who doesn't always tell the truth.

389
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:33.425
This place...

390
00:26:35.427 --> 00:26:36.761
and the people here...

391
00:26:39.139 --> 00:26:40.849
are not what you think.

392
00:26:43.727 --> 00:26:47.981
- Good morning. children.
- Good morning. Papa.

393
00:26:48.815 --> 00:26:52.027
I've got something very
special planned for you today.

394
00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:53.861
Are you ready?

395
00:26:53.862 --> 00:26:55.572
Yes. Papa.

396
00:26:55.655 --> 00:26:56.865
Good.

397
00:26:56.948 --> 00:26:58.950
Seventeen. would you open the door?

398
00:26:59.034 --> 00:27:00.785
- Yes. Papa.
- Off you go.

399
00:27:09.878 --> 00:27:10.878
After you.

400
00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.311
We should've just told her the truth.

401
00:27:26.394 --> 00:27:27.687
And risk everything?

402
00:27:28.521 --> 00:27:29.521
No.

403
00:27:30.482 --> 00:27:32.192
She'll find out soon enough.

404
00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:55.382
Dude. I'm telling you. you're
taking us the wrong way.

405
00:27:55.465 --> 00:27:57.717
It's north. I'm positive.
I checked the map.

406
00:27:57.801 --> 00:28:00.428
You do realize Skull Rock. it's
a super popular make-out spot?

407
00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:01.512
Yeah. So?

408
00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:04.307
Yeah. well. it wasn't popular
until I made it popular.

409
00:28:04.391 --> 00:28:06.101
All right? I practically invented it.

410
00:28:06.184 --> 00:28:08.436
- We're heading in the wrong direction.
- Steve.

411
00:28:08.978 --> 00:28:12.524
- Where are you going? Steve!
- Stop whining. Let's go. Trust me.

412
00:28:13.692 --> 00:28:16.361
Okay. so apparently
we're going this way now?

413
00:28:16.444 --> 00:28:18.613
I swear to God. if they get us lost...

414
00:28:21.991 --> 00:28:22.991
Hey.

415
00:28:23.602 --> 00:28:24.619
You okay?

416
00:28:24.619 --> 00:28:25.662
Uh. yeah.

417
00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.748
I'm fine. Just...

418
00:28:29.666 --> 00:28:31.668
thinking about Patrick. You know?

419
00:28:32.377 --> 00:28:33.377
Yeah.

420
00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.922
I mean. it's... it's like.

421
00:28:36.631 --> 00:28:38.299
why him?

422
00:28:39.342 --> 00:28:41.845
But then. I remember this one day.

423
00:28:41.928 --> 00:28:44.013
he... he came to
practice with a black eye.

424
00:28:44.514 --> 00:28:47.517
He said he fell. but
clearly he was lying.

425
00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:52.647
It's like everyone Vecna targets

426
00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:54.733
has something in their life.

427
00:28:56.484 --> 00:28:58.445
- Something that's...
- Hurting them.

428
00:29:00.947 --> 00:29:01.947
Haunting them.

429
00:29:03.032 --> 00:29:04.032
Yeah.

430
00:29:05.326 --> 00:29:07.454
I... I didn't really know Patrick.

431
00:29:07.537 --> 00:29:10.081
so it was easy to just

432
00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:12.792
look the other way. I guess.

433
00:29:14.669 --> 00:29:16.337
But I did know you.

434
00:29:18.631 --> 00:29:21.384
And I'm sorry I wasn't there.

435
00:29:21.926 --> 00:29:22.926
It's not your fault.

436
00:29:23.678 --> 00:29:25.013
- No.
- I disappeared.

437
00:29:25.096 --> 00:29:26.848
No. no. you didn't.

438
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.476
I just didn't look hard enough.

439
00:29:30.351 --> 00:29:31.478
Okay?

440
00:29:32.103 --> 00:29:33.480
But I see you now.

441
00:29:34.814 --> 00:29:35.857
I see you.

442
00:29:41.446 --> 00:29:45.158
Oh my God. they're so adorable. I
just wanna squeeze 'em. you know?

443
00:29:45.742 --> 00:29:47.530
If I'm permitted to see a silver lining

444
00:29:47.531 --> 00:29:49.996
in this end-of-the-world doom and gloom.

445
00:29:50.079 --> 00:29:52.961
it would be the rekindling of old flames

446
00:29:52.962 --> 00:29:54.876
that never should've been snuffed out.

447
00:29:55.835 --> 00:29:58.379
I didn't mean that
as a hint or anything.

448
00:29:58.463 --> 00:29:59.464
Right.

449
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.510
But if I did mean it as a
hint. would that be so terrible?

450
00:30:03.593 --> 00:30:05.470
To wish for happiness for my friends?

451
00:30:05.553 --> 00:30:07.597
You think I'm not happy?

452
00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.681
I... I'm sure you are.

453
00:30:08.765 --> 00:30:10.850
It's just. the other
day. I mentioned Jonathan

454
00:30:10.934 --> 00:30:13.186
and you flinched or
winced or something like...

455
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:15.396
I didn't flinch or wince.

456
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.315
- Okay.
- Jonathan and I are fine.

457
00:30:17.398 --> 00:30:18.398
- Got it.
- We're good.

458
00:30:18.441 --> 00:30:19.818
Right.

459
00:30:20.944 --> 00:30:22.111
It's just...

460
00:30:26.199 --> 00:30:28.368
He was supposed to
be here for the break.

461
00:30:28.451 --> 00:30:30.820
and then he backed
out at the last minute

462
00:30:30.821 --> 00:30:33.790
for some vague. mumbly Jonathan reason.

463
00:30:33.873 --> 00:30:36.084
And. to be honest.
I'm not that surprised

464
00:30:36.167 --> 00:30:38.294
because I've been
feeling him pulling away.

465
00:30:38.378 --> 00:30:41.130
And I don't know if it's
because we're 2.000 miles away

466
00:30:41.214 --> 00:30:43.550
or if he met someone new or what.

467
00:30:43.633 --> 00:30:45.343
And now I can't find out why

468
00:30:45.426 --> 00:30:48.638
because apparently he's blown up his
family's house phone or something.

469
00:30:48.721 --> 00:30:50.340
So. yeah. if... if
the mention of his name

470
00:30:50.341 --> 00:30:53.518
caused a slight muscle spasm on my face.

471
00:30:53.601 --> 00:30:56.312
that's... probably why.

472
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:59.060
Seems like a perfectly reasonable reason

473
00:30:59.061 --> 00:31:01.359
to flinch. wince. or something.

474
00:31:03.778 --> 00:31:07.824
You said. "the happiness
of your friends."

475
00:31:07.907 --> 00:31:10.660
So does that make us friends?

476
00:31:10.743 --> 00:31:12.537
As in. officially?

477
00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:15.456
Uh. yeah. I... I mean. right?

478
00:31:16.291 --> 00:31:17.291
Right.

479
00:31:19.586 --> 00:31:20.670
Oh. boom!

480
00:31:20.753 --> 00:31:23.089
Bada bing. bada boom.
There she is. Henderson.

481
00:31:23.172 --> 00:31:24.382
Skull Rock.

482
00:31:24.465 --> 00:31:27.343
In your face. man. In your
stupid. cocky little face.

483
00:31:28.411 --> 00:31:29.470
Doesn't make sense.

484
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:32.098
Yeah. yeah. Even with it staring
you in the face. you can't admit it.

485
00:31:32.181 --> 00:31:34.183
Can't admit you're wrong. you butthead.

486
00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:36.185
I concur.

487
00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:38.479
You. Dustin Henderson. are a...

488
00:31:39.689 --> 00:31:41.149
total butthead.

489
00:31:41.232 --> 00:31:43.026
Jesus. we thought you were a goner.

490
00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:45.528
Yeah. me too. man.

491
00:31:46.446 --> 00:31:47.447
Me too.

492
00:31:51.868 --> 00:31:54.579
How long have you known
Eddie was killing these kids?

493
00:31:54.662 --> 00:31:56.664
It was his trailer
where Chrissy was killed.

494
00:31:56.748 --> 00:31:59.834
and you expect us to believe he was
made a suspect just this morning?

495
00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:03.129
The truth is we've been
following several leads.

496
00:32:03.212 --> 00:32:05.757
and. yes. Eddie Munson was one of them.

497
00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.636
And we are now doing everything
in our power to find him.

498
00:32:10.887 --> 00:32:13.348
In the meantime. for your safety.

499
00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:15.558
we will be enforcing a strict curfew.

500
00:32:15.642 --> 00:32:17.727
- What?
- That's your solution?

501
00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:20.688
- Hide from him?
- We're already doing that.

502
00:32:20.772 --> 00:32:22.523
It's been days. Days!

503
00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:25.151
So you tell me why he's
not behind bars right now.

504
00:32:25.234 --> 00:32:28.863
I understand you all are
upset. but I promise you.

505
00:32:28.947 --> 00:32:30.531
we will find him.

506
00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:31.658
No.

507
00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:36.620
You won't.

508
00:32:36.996 --> 00:32:37.996
Jason?

509
00:32:38.831 --> 00:32:40.917
Son. how about we talk
about this in private?

510
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.670
Why? So you can keep me quiet?

511
00:32:43.753 --> 00:32:46.130
So you can keep the
truth from coming out?

512
00:32:46.214 --> 00:32:47.966
I don't know about the rest of you.

513
00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:50.802
but I can't bear to listen
to any more excuses and lies.

514
00:32:50.885 --> 00:32:53.137
- That's enough.
- I agree. I've had enough!

515
00:32:54.305 --> 00:32:56.224
In fact. I think we've all had enough.

516
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:08.111
Last night...

517
00:33:14.242 --> 00:33:16.744
Last night. I saw things.
things I can't explain.

518
00:33:18.454 --> 00:33:22.291
Things the police don't wanna believe.

519
00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:26.045
And things that I don't
wanna believe myself.

520
00:33:26.129 --> 00:33:28.172
But I know what I saw. I know.

521
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:31.968
And I've come to accept an awful truth.

522
00:33:33.302 --> 00:33:36.681
These murders are
ritualistic sacrifices.

523
00:33:36.764 --> 00:33:40.143
We've all heard how satanic cults
are spreading through our country

524
00:33:40.226 --> 00:33:41.769
like some... some disease.

525
00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:43.187
And Eddie Munson

526
00:33:44.022 --> 00:33:45.982
is the leader of one of these cults.

527
00:33:46.482 --> 00:33:48.484
A cult that operates here in Hawkins.

528
00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:51.279
The mall fire.

529
00:33:51.362 --> 00:33:53.531
All those unexplained
deaths over the years.

530
00:33:54.157 --> 00:33:57.326
Some people say our town is
cursed. They just don't know why.

531
00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:59.037
Now... Now we do.

532
00:33:59.662 --> 00:34:00.662
Now we know.

533
00:34:04.667 --> 00:34:05.877
They call themselves Hellfire.

534
00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.462
That's bullshit!

535
00:34:07.545 --> 00:34:10.840
The Hellfire isn't a cult.
It's a club for nerds.

536
00:34:10.923 --> 00:34:12.884
- Erica!
- Just the facts.

537
00:34:12.967 --> 00:34:13.967
A club.

538
00:34:14.552 --> 00:34:17.930
A club. A harmless club. That's
what they want you to think.

539
00:34:18.681 --> 00:34:20.183
But it's a lie.

540
00:34:20.266 --> 00:34:22.185
A lie designed to conceal the truth.

541
00:34:24.562 --> 00:34:28.608
And now this cult is
protecting its leader. Eddie.

542
00:34:28.691 --> 00:34:29.776
Hiding him.

543
00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:33.071
Allowing him to... to
continue his rampage.

544
00:34:33.654 --> 00:34:37.283
Last night. I became overcome with
this feeling of... of hopelessness.

545
00:34:38.618 --> 00:34:40.953
Then I remembered Romans 12:21.

546
00:34:42.163 --> 00:34:43.873
"Do not be overcome by evil."

547
00:34:45.124 --> 00:34:47.043
"But overcome evil with good."

548
00:34:47.126 --> 00:34:49.504
And God knows there's good in this town.

549
00:34:49.587 --> 00:34:52.215
So much good. It's in this room!

550
00:34:52.298 --> 00:34:55.009
It's in this room.
right here. right now.

551
00:34:55.551 --> 00:34:57.512
So I came here today. humbly.

552
00:34:58.054 --> 00:34:59.305
to ask for your help.

553
00:34:59.972 --> 00:35:01.349
To join me in this fight.

554
00:35:01.432 --> 00:35:05.353
Let us cast out this evil
and save Hawkins together.

555
00:35:25.414 --> 00:35:27.542
What are y'all just sitting around for?

556
00:35:27.625 --> 00:35:28.876
You heard the kid.

557
00:35:37.343 --> 00:35:38.343
Hey.

558
00:35:39.262 --> 00:35:41.472
I want you all to hear
me loud and clear on this.

559
00:35:41.556 --> 00:35:45.059
Anyone interfering
with this investigation

560
00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:46.811
will be arrested.

561
00:35:46.894 --> 00:35:50.022
Hey! Hey! We will be
implementing a curfew.

562
00:35:50.106 --> 00:35:54.610
If you are not in your house
after sunset with the doors locked.

563
00:35:54.694 --> 00:35:55.862
you'll be written up.

564
00:35:56.362 --> 00:35:58.698
And it's gonna go on
your permanent record.

565
00:36:05.037 --> 00:36:07.582
Okay. that is a lot to process.

566
00:36:08.291 --> 00:36:12.461
I mean. that might be seriously
the craziest thing I've ever heard.

567
00:36:12.545 --> 00:36:14.005
I know. it's hard to believe.

568
00:36:14.088 --> 00:36:15.506
But it's true. All true.

569
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:20.553
I dial in to this computer
and find a location.

570
00:36:20.636 --> 00:36:23.347
and at this location
is the Nina Project?

571
00:36:23.431 --> 00:36:24.431
Exactly.

572
00:36:24.432 --> 00:36:27.935
And the Nina Project is the
code name for a video game?

573
00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:30.897
No. it's not just a video
game. It's a video game console.

574
00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.399
It's basically America's
answer to Nintendo.

575
00:36:33.482 --> 00:36:34.984
Americantendo.

576
00:36:35.067 --> 00:36:36.152
That's a stupid name.

577
00:36:36.235 --> 00:36:40.406
You're right. it is a stupid
name. but. Suzie. it's 16-bit.

578
00:36:40.489 --> 00:36:41.741
Sixteen-bit?

579
00:36:42.325 --> 00:36:44.869
- Why have I never heard of it?
- Because it's top secret.

580
00:36:44.952 --> 00:36:48.289
- That's why we're doing this.
- Yeah. right. It's for the promotion.

581
00:36:48.372 --> 00:36:50.750
The first people to find the
secret location receive a...

582
00:36:50.833 --> 00:36:53.044
- Americantendo?
- Uh. an Americantendo.

583
00:36:53.127 --> 00:36:55.880
So you drove 3.000 miles
over your spring break

584
00:36:55.963 --> 00:36:58.216
so I can help you get
a new video game console

585
00:36:58.299 --> 00:36:59.383
no one has ever heard of?

586
00:36:59.467 --> 00:37:00.760
Yes.

587
00:37:01.761 --> 00:37:04.472
- But it's not for us. It's for Dustin.
- Right.

588
00:37:04.555 --> 00:37:07.683
Exactly. It's for Dustin. For
Dustin's birthday. which is...

589
00:37:07.767 --> 00:37:09.477
In two months. three days. five hours.

590
00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.312
I don't know what you're doing.

591
00:37:11.395 --> 00:37:13.773
but I am not spending my
entire day babysitting.

592
00:37:13.856 --> 00:37:15.942
- Pull your damn weight.
- Language!

593
00:37:16.025 --> 00:37:18.069
Oh no. am I gonna burn in hell now?

594
00:37:18.152 --> 00:37:19.152
You tell her. Eden.

595
00:37:19.779 --> 00:37:21.906
- Out of my room.
- Don't touch me. you little shit!

596
00:37:21.989 --> 00:37:24.951
Okay. so can you help?

597
00:37:25.034 --> 00:37:27.286
I would do anything for Dustybun.

598
00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:30.957
but I'm afraid there's been
an unfortunate development.

599
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:35.378
After changing Dusty's grade. I was
wracked with the most awful guilt.

600
00:37:35.461 --> 00:37:37.505
Suzie. I am incredibly disappointed.

601
00:37:37.588 --> 00:37:39.241
Father could see my soul was tortured.

602
00:37:39.242 --> 00:37:40.841
and he wrenched a confession out of me.

603
00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:42.385
I wanted to help him.

604
00:37:42.468 --> 00:37:45.680
Not only was I breaking the
law. I was dating an agnostic.

605
00:37:46.264 --> 00:37:47.765
An agnostic!

606
00:37:47.848 --> 00:37:50.351
- I've never seen Father so angry.
- ... starting today.

607
00:37:50.434 --> 00:37:51.477
He needed me.

608
00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.521
- Naturally...
- Father. no!

609
00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:55.690
... after learning the terrible truth.

610
00:37:55.773 --> 00:37:57.441
he confiscated my computer.

611
00:37:57.525 --> 00:37:59.986
And Father is not one
to change his mind.

612
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:03.072
I'm as likely to see it again
as I am my poor Dustybun.

613
00:38:04.073 --> 00:38:05.073
Where is it?

614
00:38:05.116 --> 00:38:06.116
His study.

615
00:38:06.617 --> 00:38:07.994
He uses it for work now.

616
00:38:08.077 --> 00:38:12.164
And Father's always working. and his
door is. like. permanently locked.

617
00:38:12.248 --> 00:38:14.083
I'm really sorry.

618
00:38:14.583 --> 00:38:15.583
Truly.

619
00:38:16.294 --> 00:38:18.671
But it looks like you came
all the way here for nothing.

620
00:38:18.754 --> 00:38:20.881
Cornelius!

621
00:38:24.051 --> 00:38:25.051
Unless...

622
00:38:25.928 --> 00:38:28.222
- Unless?
- There might be a way.

623
00:38:28.306 --> 00:38:29.890
But we're gonna need help.

624
00:38:30.474 --> 00:38:32.059
And I mean a lot of help.

625
00:38:33.686 --> 00:38:34.854
All right.

626
00:38:51.412 --> 00:38:52.955
Guys?

627
00:38:53.039 --> 00:38:54.123
Are you down here?

628
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:55.790
Guys?

629
00:38:57.752 --> 00:39:00.129
They should've been back by now.

630
00:39:00.212 --> 00:39:01.339
They should be back.

631
00:39:01.422 --> 00:39:03.841
- What time was the movie?
- Uh. four hours ago.

632
00:39:03.924 --> 00:39:06.469
Hate to break it to you. Mrs.
Wheeler. but they lied to you.

633
00:39:06.552 --> 00:39:09.055
- âª Liar. liar. pants on fire âª
- Holly.

634
00:39:09.138 --> 00:39:12.183
We don't think they're actually
involved with Eddie. do we?

635
00:39:12.266 --> 00:39:14.852
I think at this point.
anything's possible.

636
00:39:14.935 --> 00:39:18.606
- Our children are not murderers. Ted.
- Don't put words in my mouth.

637
00:39:19.273 --> 00:39:21.317
See. she does that. twists my words.

638
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.277
You're calling the theater?

639
00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:25.488
The police.

640
00:39:29.241 --> 00:39:32.453
When I got to the shore. I tried
calling you guys. but. uh...

641
00:39:35.247 --> 00:39:37.083
my walkie was busted. man.

642
00:39:37.166 --> 00:39:38.166
Drenched.

643
00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:42.171
So. uh. I did the thing
that I do now. apparently.

644
00:39:42.838 --> 00:39:44.298
I ran.

645
00:39:44.382 --> 00:39:47.176
Do you know what time
this was? The attack?

646
00:39:47.259 --> 00:39:50.137
Yeah. no. I... I know
exactly what time it was.

647
00:39:50.221 --> 00:39:53.391
My walkie wasn't the only
thing that got soaked.

648
00:39:56.727 --> 00:39:58.896
- 9:27.
- Same time our flashlights went kablooey.

649
00:39:58.979 --> 00:40:00.689
Which means what. exactly?

650
00:40:00.773 --> 00:40:04.568
That that surge of energy
was Vecna attacking Patrick.

651
00:40:04.652 --> 00:40:06.695
Well. we're one step closer.

652
00:40:06.779 --> 00:40:08.531
We know how Vecna attacks.

653
00:40:08.614 --> 00:40:10.199
And where he attacks from.

654
00:40:10.282 --> 00:40:13.577
So now we just need to sneak
into his lair in the Upside Down

655
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:15.162
and drive a stake through his heart.

656
00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:16.330
If he has a heart.

657
00:40:16.414 --> 00:40:18.582
A stake? Is he like a
vamp? Is he a vampire?

658
00:40:18.666 --> 00:40:20.876
- It was a metaphor.
- A bullet should work on him. right?

659
00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.378
I say we chop his head off.

660
00:40:22.461 --> 00:40:24.672
All of the above. but
we can't do any of that

661
00:40:24.755 --> 00:40:28.217
- 'til we find a way into the Upside Down.
- We need El to get her powers back.

662
00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.554
Everything was way easier. We had
this girl. She had superpowers.

663
00:40:31.637 --> 00:40:34.056
Superpowers. Yeah. you mentioned her.

664
00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:38.352
Hey. uh. Henderson's
not. uh. cursed. is he?

665
00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:40.229
Cursed? No. no. He's fine.

666
00:40:40.312 --> 00:40:42.982
Mental? Absolutely.

667
00:40:43.607 --> 00:40:44.817
Boom!

668
00:40:46.527 --> 00:40:49.613
Bada... bada... boom.

669
00:40:50.239 --> 00:40:51.991
I was right.

670
00:40:52.074 --> 00:40:54.493
Skull Rock was north.

671
00:40:54.577 --> 00:40:56.704
- Seriously? You're serious?
- Mm-hmm.

672
00:40:56.787 --> 00:40:58.456
- This is Skull Rock. Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

673
00:40:58.539 --> 00:41:01.876
You're totally. absolutely.
100% wrong. Right now.

674
00:41:01.959 --> 00:41:02.959
Yes.

675
00:41:03.794 --> 00:41:05.254
And no.

676
00:41:05.337 --> 00:41:06.422
Oh my God.

677
00:41:06.505 --> 00:41:09.258
This worked correctly
when we left the Wheelers'.

678
00:41:09.341 --> 00:41:11.469
Correct when we got in the car on Curly.

679
00:41:11.552 --> 00:41:13.512
But it started to slip
the further east we went.

680
00:41:13.596 --> 00:41:16.098
Now it's way off.

681
00:41:16.182 --> 00:41:18.684
When I was leading us
here. I wasn't wrong.

682
00:41:19.643 --> 00:41:20.728
The compass was.

683
00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:22.897
So you're using faulty
equipment. You're still wrong.

684
00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.899
Except it isn't faulty.

685
00:41:24.982 --> 00:41:27.234
Lucas. remember what
can affect a compass?

686
00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:29.778
- An electromagnetic field.
- Yep.

687
00:41:29.862 --> 00:41:31.780
Sorry. I must've skipped that class.

688
00:41:31.864 --> 00:41:34.700
In the presence of a stronger
electromagnetic field.

689
00:41:34.783 --> 00:41:37.578
the needle will deflect
towards that power.

690
00:41:37.661 --> 00:41:41.165
So either there's some super
big magnet around here. or...

691
00:41:41.248 --> 00:41:42.248
There's a gate.

692
00:41:42.708 --> 00:41:44.752
But we're nowhere near the lab.

693
00:41:44.835 --> 00:41:48.255
But what if. somehow.
there's another gate?

694
00:41:48.339 --> 00:41:50.007
A gate that we don't know about.

695
00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:52.301
It'd have to be smaller.
Way less powerful.

696
00:41:52.384 --> 00:41:54.011
- Snack-size gate.
- How? Why?

697
00:41:54.094 --> 00:41:58.057
No idea. All I know is that
something is causing this disturbance.

698
00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.893
and the last time we've seen
anything like it. it was a gate.

699
00:42:00.976 --> 00:42:03.771
And I hope it is because
then we'd have a way to Vecna.

700
00:42:03.854 --> 00:42:06.148
And a shot at freeing
Max from this curse.

701
00:42:07.066 --> 00:42:09.818
Where are you going?
Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey.

702
00:42:09.902 --> 00:42:13.239
Eddie's still a wanted man. We
can't just go hike in the woods.

703
00:42:13.322 --> 00:42:14.953
This little steel capsule

704
00:42:14.954 --> 00:42:18.827
might be the key to
saving both Max and Eddie.

705
00:42:20.162 --> 00:42:22.164
What say you. Eddie the Banished?

706
00:42:25.376 --> 00:42:28.629
I say you're asking me
to follow you into Mordor.

707
00:42:28.712 --> 00:42:31.674
which. if I'm totally straight with you.

708
00:42:31.757 --> 00:42:33.759
I think is a really bad idea.

709
00:42:34.301 --> 00:42:36.178
But. uh. the Shire...

710
00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.014
the Shire is burning.

711
00:42:44.478 --> 00:42:45.813
So Mordor it is.

712
00:42:51.986 --> 00:42:53.529
What is Mordor?

713
00:42:54.989 --> 00:42:56.991
Get your stuff. dude. Let's go.

714
00:43:00.869 --> 00:43:01.869
Today.

715
00:43:02.705 --> 00:43:05.040
we are going to play a game.

716
00:43:06.292 --> 00:43:08.627
The rules of the game are quite simple.

717
00:43:08.711 --> 00:43:11.297
Stay in your circle.

718
00:43:12.464 --> 00:43:13.966
If you leave your circle.

719
00:43:14.633 --> 00:43:15.884
you lose.

720
00:43:16.468 --> 00:43:19.388
The last person standing in their circle

721
00:43:20.347 --> 00:43:22.975
will get to spend an
extra hour of free time

722
00:43:23.684 --> 00:43:25.227
in the rainbow room.

723
00:43:27.062 --> 00:43:31.734
Now. even though we are going to
be competing against one another...

724
00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:33.319
Two.

725
00:43:34.637 --> 00:43:35.696
Six.

726
00:43:35.696 --> 00:43:36.954
... I don't want you to approach this

727
00:43:36.955 --> 00:43:39.700
any differently than one of our tests.

728
00:43:39.783 --> 00:43:40.951
Yeah?

729
00:43:41.035 --> 00:43:43.495
Now. this is very important.

730
00:43:44.163 --> 00:43:48.250
If you allow anger or emotion

731
00:43:48.876 --> 00:43:50.461
to invade your thoughts.

732
00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:53.589
you will fail.

733
00:43:55.007 --> 00:43:56.008
I promise.

734
00:43:56.925 --> 00:43:58.177
Do you understand?

735
00:43:59.386 --> 00:44:01.013
Yes. Papa.

736
00:44:02.473 --> 00:44:03.682
Good.

737
00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:10.439
Begin.

738
00:44:30.209 --> 00:44:31.251
Very good. Two.

739
00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.129
Number Six.

740
00:44:34.713 --> 00:44:35.713
please.

741
00:44:35.756 --> 00:44:37.383
take a seat by the door.

742
00:44:47.668 --> 00:44:48.686
Five.

743
00:45:01.949 --> 00:45:03.367
Ah!

744
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:24.847
Eleven.

745
00:45:46.827 --> 00:45:47.827
Good luck.

746
00:45:54.126 --> 00:45:55.335
Begin.

747
00:46:19.818 --> 00:46:22.780
He'd found his strength
in a memory from his past.

748
00:46:23.363 --> 00:46:24.823
Something that made him sad.

749
00:46:24.907 --> 00:46:26.408
but also angry.

750
00:46:30.746 --> 00:46:32.456
Do you have a memory like that?

751
00:46:33.165 --> 00:46:34.917
Jane. No! No!

752
00:46:35.417 --> 00:46:36.460
No!

753
00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:01.401
Well. well.

754
00:47:02.027 --> 00:47:03.862
It looks like we have a new winner.

755
00:47:26.593 --> 00:47:29.638
I present you... Kyrzran.

756
00:47:32.266 --> 00:47:34.643
You see that gray steeple over there?

757
00:47:34.726 --> 00:47:36.311
That is Yuri's warehouse.

758
00:47:36.395 --> 00:47:37.813
Looks like a church.

759
00:47:37.896 --> 00:47:41.400
Let's see what miracles it holds. yes?

760
00:48:04.339 --> 00:48:06.258
Oh.

761
00:48:06.341 --> 00:48:09.011
Someone has been in my peanut butter.

762
00:48:09.803 --> 00:48:12.681
Very popular. as I say. eh?

763
00:48:12.764 --> 00:48:13.764
Weapons.

764
00:48:14.141 --> 00:48:15.601
Where are the weapons?

765
00:48:21.648 --> 00:48:24.610
- Oh Jesus.
- Hey. Not in a church.

766
00:48:24.693 --> 00:48:28.322
You like all this? Wait
until you see my flamethrower.

767
00:48:28.405 --> 00:48:32.034
We don't have time for
show-and-tell. We need to get going.

768
00:48:32.117 --> 00:48:34.036
She's always this bossy?

769
00:48:34.119 --> 00:48:35.329
You heard her.

770
00:48:37.247 --> 00:48:38.916
Keys. map.

771
00:48:40.083 --> 00:48:41.084
Let's go.

772
00:48:43.587 --> 00:48:46.173
So. prison is here.

773
00:48:47.007 --> 00:48:49.009
Between these two mountains.

774
00:48:49.092 --> 00:48:50.928
Approximately two-hour drive.

775
00:48:51.011 --> 00:48:52.095
I don't see anything.

776
00:48:52.179 --> 00:48:55.265
Because it's not on the
map. but it is there.

777
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:57.935
How do we know you're not
leading us into some trap?

778
00:48:58.018 --> 00:48:59.978
Because I do not need to.

779
00:49:00.062 --> 00:49:05.108
You want to break into deadliest
prison in all motherland.

780
00:49:05.192 --> 00:49:07.361
It is suicide.

781
00:49:07.444 --> 00:49:09.780
Who said anything about breaking in?

782
00:49:09.863 --> 00:49:12.407
Oh. You just expect to knock?

783
00:49:12.491 --> 00:49:16.036
"Oh hello. let me in. I'm friendly
American with a big beard."

784
00:49:18.455 --> 00:49:21.083
Something like that. actually. yes.

785
00:49:21.166 --> 00:49:23.418
You were planning to turn
us over to the warden.

786
00:49:23.502 --> 00:49:25.963
Today. if I'm not mistaken.

787
00:49:26.046 --> 00:49:29.091
Ah. I see now.

788
00:49:29.174 --> 00:49:30.968
I bring you in as prisoners

789
00:49:31.051 --> 00:49:33.053
and then set you free inside walls.

790
00:49:33.136 --> 00:49:35.681
It is risky. crazy.

791
00:49:35.764 --> 00:49:37.891
you will still probably die.

792
00:49:37.975 --> 00:49:39.393
yet I like it.

793
00:49:40.477 --> 00:49:42.854
But for this to work.
Yuri cannot be tied.

794
00:49:42.938 --> 00:49:45.232
Hey. it's hard to turn over prisoners

795
00:49:45.315 --> 00:49:46.984
when I'm a prisoner myself.

796
00:49:47.067 --> 00:49:50.612
Hey. I think the warden
might find that suspicious.

797
00:49:50.696 --> 00:49:53.198
Which is why. from here on out.

798
00:49:53.281 --> 00:49:55.450
you're gonna be Murray.

799
00:49:55.534 --> 00:49:58.036
And I'm gonna be Yuri.

800
00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:00.080
I don't follow.

801
00:50:00.163 --> 00:50:01.163
Don't worry.

802
00:50:05.919 --> 00:50:07.254
It's a silent role.

803
00:50:08.046 --> 00:50:09.798
Ah!

804
00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:28.233
You want to make a fool
of yourself. go ahead.

805
00:50:28.316 --> 00:50:31.111
But to bring down these men.
leaving them with no hope.

806
00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:32.487
what is the purpose of that?

807
00:50:32.571 --> 00:50:34.698
I tell them truth. You
feed their delusion.

808
00:50:34.781 --> 00:50:36.199
Not delusions. Hope.

809
00:50:36.283 --> 00:50:39.077
I believe we can fight.
I believe we can win.

810
00:50:39.161 --> 00:50:40.787
I have a son. Mikhail.

811
00:50:40.871 --> 00:50:43.498
I cannot leave this world with him
believing his father is a traitor.

812
00:50:43.582 --> 00:50:46.001
I need to get back to him.
and I will get back to him.

813
00:50:46.084 --> 00:50:48.128
- Is he slow?
- What?

814
00:50:48.211 --> 00:50:51.256
Mikhail. your son. Is...
Is he slow? Is he stupid?

815
00:50:51.339 --> 00:50:52.466
Stop talking.

816
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:54.509
No. he's very smart. Top of his class.

817
00:50:54.593 --> 00:50:55.677
Be silent!

818
00:50:55.761 --> 00:50:56.887
Then you're not his father.

819
00:50:56.970 --> 00:50:57.970
I said go!

820
00:50:58.013 --> 00:50:59.473
You are drunk. American.

821
00:50:59.556 --> 00:51:01.933
I would stop speaking unless
you wish to die sooner.

822
00:51:02.017 --> 00:51:04.269
I can. It doesn't matter.
I know I'm gonna die today.

823
00:51:04.352 --> 00:51:07.022
But guess what? I know who
I am and what I've done.

824
00:51:07.105 --> 00:51:08.690
unlike you and these men.

825
00:51:08.774 --> 00:51:10.484
who can't face the truth.

826
00:51:10.567 --> 00:51:12.861
That you're the reason why
we're in here. You're gonna die.

827
00:51:12.944 --> 00:51:13.945
Come on. go!

828
00:51:14.029 --> 00:51:16.114
Your son is not your son...

829
00:51:16.198 --> 00:51:17.198
I said to be silent!

830
00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:21.453
... and your wife...

831
00:51:21.536 --> 00:51:23.747
Come on! Come on!

832
00:51:54.694 --> 00:51:56.488
You do that again...

833
00:51:57.447 --> 00:51:59.282
we shoot you on the spot.

834
00:52:00.742 --> 00:52:02.452
Fools.

835
00:52:02.536 --> 00:52:04.913
You happy now. American?

836
00:52:06.748 --> 00:52:08.333
Was that worth it?

837
00:52:08.416 --> 00:52:09.709
Was that worth it?

838
00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:16.550
We call it a Demogorgon.

839
00:52:17.175 --> 00:52:20.178
I don't know how they got it here
or what they're doing with it. but...

840
00:52:21.138 --> 00:52:23.014
everything I said about it's true.

841
00:52:24.057 --> 00:52:25.600
Except it has one weakness.

842
00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:28.395
Fire.

843
00:52:29.396 --> 00:52:30.397
Hates fire.

844
00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:33.233
So I figure. if we want a
shot at killing this thing.

845
00:52:33.817 --> 00:52:34.943
we need some fuel.

846
00:52:35.527 --> 00:52:37.988
And I need something to light it with.

847
00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:44.828
So you asked me if it was worth it?

848
00:52:44.911 --> 00:52:47.038
To answer your question...

849
00:52:48.582 --> 00:52:50.667
... yeah. I think it was worth it.

850
00:52:53.086 --> 00:52:55.672
You son of a bitch.

851
00:52:55.755 --> 00:52:58.091
You son of a bitch.

852
00:52:58.175 --> 00:53:01.178
Don't make me laugh. My ribs
are broken. Don't make me laugh.

853
00:53:14.357 --> 00:53:15.400
Cornelius?

854
00:53:18.236 --> 00:53:19.571
Cornelius?

855
00:53:19.654 --> 00:53:21.114
Cornelius!

856
00:53:28.121 --> 00:53:30.290
- Wait. where's Argyle?
- Shit. I don't know.

857
00:53:30.874 --> 00:53:33.043
And three. two...

858
00:53:35.962 --> 00:53:37.756
Oh my God.

859
00:53:37.839 --> 00:53:39.049
Way to go. Cornelius.

860
00:53:42.052 --> 00:53:45.222
Away. you mouldy rogue! Away!

861
00:53:47.933 --> 00:53:49.684
And we're in.

862
00:53:49.768 --> 00:53:51.519
Holy sh... heck.

863
00:53:51.603 --> 00:53:53.188
Oh holy heck. You did it.

864
00:53:53.271 --> 00:53:55.607
Hold your applause. I
don't see an address.

865
00:53:56.233 --> 00:53:57.984
"Office." Try "office."

866
00:54:01.613 --> 00:54:03.615
What is all this?

867
00:54:06.368 --> 00:54:09.120
Tanner. Tatum. out of the way!

868
00:54:10.538 --> 00:54:12.415
Cornelius.

869
00:54:16.503 --> 00:54:18.672
Maybe it's hidden in the code?

870
00:54:18.755 --> 00:54:21.841
- What you just said makes no sense.
- Hold your butts. I'll trace the IP.

871
00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:23.301
The... The I-what?

872
00:54:23.385 --> 00:54:24.928
The internet protocol address.

873
00:54:25.011 --> 00:54:27.722
It's a unique numerical label
given to all information technology

874
00:54:27.806 --> 00:54:28.807
connected to the Internet.

875
00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:30.934
- What's the Internet?
- Don't worry about it.

876
00:54:31.017 --> 00:54:33.144
It's just gonna change the world.

877
00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:43.071
What's happening now?

878
00:54:43.154 --> 00:54:45.240
I'm running the IP through
a geolocation software.

879
00:54:45.323 --> 00:54:46.950
Basically a form of data mining.

880
00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:54.624
Tabitha!

881
00:54:55.483 --> 00:54:56.501
Tabitha?

882
00:54:56.501 --> 00:54:58.461
Tabitha. Oh no.

883
00:54:59.754 --> 00:55:00.755
And cut!

884
00:55:01.339 --> 00:55:04.259
Incredible. Just incredible.

885
00:55:04.342 --> 00:55:06.594
And. Father. your terror.

886
00:55:07.804 --> 00:55:08.888
It looked genuine.

887
00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:12.975
Bingo.

888
00:55:13.018 --> 00:55:14.018
Nevada?

889
00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:15.186
Can you print this?

890
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:17.731
No. my skills end at IP geolocation.

891
00:55:23.611 --> 00:55:25.030
You were being sarcastic.

892
00:55:25.113 --> 00:55:26.113
Yeah.

893
00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:30.535
These kids are gonna
drive me to the loony bin.

894
00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:36.333
Hi. Father. You look
like you need a nap.

895
00:55:40.754 --> 00:55:41.921
Slow down!

896
00:55:49.304 --> 00:55:50.347
Dustin's right.

897
00:55:51.139 --> 00:55:52.682
You're a certified genius.

898
00:55:54.684 --> 00:55:56.603
I think we just spooked a skunk.

899
00:56:00.315 --> 00:56:02.692
âª Pass the Dutchie 'Pon
the left-hand side... âª

900
00:56:02.776 --> 00:56:03.776
Yo.

901
00:56:04.361 --> 00:56:05.361
My dudes.

902
00:56:05.845 --> 00:56:06.863
Any luck?

903
00:56:06.863 --> 00:56:10.116
âª Give me the music âª
âª Make me jump and prance âª

904
00:56:13.828 --> 00:56:16.539
You see that. Chief? Openly mocking us.

905
00:56:16.623 --> 00:56:17.874
Stay calm. Stay calm.

906
00:56:17.957 --> 00:56:21.419
A bunch of angry. armed
vigilantes are out hunting kids.

907
00:56:21.503 --> 00:56:22.921
openly defying us.

908
00:56:23.004 --> 00:56:24.631
and you want me to stay calm.

909
00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:26.716
Stay calm. Yeah.

910
00:56:28.927 --> 00:56:30.804
Hey. Chief. you copy?

911
00:56:30.887 --> 00:56:32.013
Yeah. I copy.

912
00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:35.600
Found their station wagon
hidden up by Skull Rock.

913
00:56:35.683 --> 00:56:36.810
No sign of them though.

914
00:56:36.893 --> 00:56:38.686
- Skull Rock?
- Yeah.

915
00:56:38.770 --> 00:56:42.190
- Isn't that a make-out spot?
- And a stone's throw from Lover's Lake.

916
00:56:42.273 --> 00:56:44.359
The hell they wanna go back there for?

917
00:56:44.442 --> 00:56:47.195
One way to find out.
Hold tight. On our way.

918
00:57:02.877 --> 00:57:04.295
Something's happening.

919
00:57:04.796 --> 00:57:07.799
Dustin? Can you slow down? Dustin?

920
00:57:09.426 --> 00:57:10.844
I think we're getting close.

921
00:57:11.428 --> 00:57:13.054
Watch your step. big guy.

922
00:57:13.555 --> 00:57:14.973
Oh man.

923
00:57:16.433 --> 00:57:18.184
- You gotta be shitting me.
- Yeah.

924
00:57:19.352 --> 00:57:22.689
- I thought these woods were familiar.
- Lover's Lake.

925
00:57:22.772 --> 00:57:25.358
This is confounding.

926
00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:27.444
There's a gate in Lover's Lake?

927
00:57:27.527 --> 00:57:29.195
Whenever the Demogorgon attacked.

928
00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:31.406
it always left an opening.

929
00:57:32.615 --> 00:57:33.867
Maybe Vecna's the same way.

930
00:57:34.784 --> 00:57:36.369
Yeah. only one way to find out.

931
00:57:41.166 --> 00:57:43.251
- Easy. I... I said easy. man.
- Sorry. dude.

932
00:57:43.334 --> 00:57:45.670
- Here you go.
- Yeah. I'm just gonna do that.

933
00:57:45.753 --> 00:57:47.755
- Thank you.
- Yeah. that works too.

934
00:57:50.884 --> 00:57:51.884
Good. you got her.

935
00:57:51.885 --> 00:57:53.178
- Wheeler.
- Thanks.

936
00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:57.182
Hey. hey. hey. you trying to sink us?

937
00:57:57.265 --> 00:57:59.809
This thing holds three
people tops. okay?

938
00:57:59.893 --> 00:58:02.770
It's better this way. okay?
You guys stay here with Max.

939
00:58:02.854 --> 00:58:04.814
- Keep an eye out for trouble.
- You keep an eye out.

940
00:58:05.982 --> 00:58:08.067
- It's my goddamn theory.
- You heard Nance.

941
00:58:08.151 --> 00:58:09.694
- Who put her in charge?
- I did.

942
00:58:10.653 --> 00:58:11.863
Compass.

943
00:58:16.743 --> 00:58:18.203
Hey. there you go.

944
00:58:18.786 --> 00:58:19.787
Ow.

945
00:58:20.914 --> 00:58:22.457
You said three.

946
00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:23.750
Sorry.

947
00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:27.420
Bedtime at nine. kiddos.

948
00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:31.216
Miss you already!

949
00:58:53.363 --> 00:58:54.364
Please!

950
00:59:24.102 --> 00:59:26.563
Please. please...

951
01:00:00.888 --> 01:00:03.016
You shouldn't be wandering the halls.

952
01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:07.604
It's against the rules.

953
01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:08.938
And not safe.

954
01:00:10.523 --> 01:00:11.858
You shamed me today.

955
01:00:12.358 --> 01:00:14.944
- I'm sorry.
- I didn't wanna hurt you.

956
01:00:16.154 --> 01:00:17.989
You are weak

957
01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:19.907
and pathetic.

958
01:00:21.659 --> 01:00:23.119
I was holding back.

959
01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:28.291
And then you do that before everyone?

960
01:00:30.001 --> 01:00:31.377
Before Papa?

961
01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:33.171
No.

962
01:00:42.263 --> 01:00:43.306
How'd that feel?

963
01:00:44.057 --> 01:00:45.183
Did you like that?

964
01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:53.941
See a light?

965
01:00:54.859 --> 01:00:55.860
I don't.

966
01:00:57.403 --> 01:00:59.364
Something must've happened to the power.

967
01:01:13.628 --> 01:01:15.546
Stop it! No!

968
01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:16.881
No!

969
01:01:27.892 --> 01:01:29.477
Tell Papa we did this.

970
01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:32.230
we will kill you.

971
01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:49.914
Aw. feeling a little dizzy there?

972
01:01:49.997 --> 01:01:51.165
Poor baby.

973
01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:40.047
What have you done?

974
01:02:41.966 --> 01:02:43.885
What have you done?

975
01:02:44.385 --> 01:02:47.555
Okay. easy. Deep breaths.

976
01:02:47.638 --> 01:02:49.223
Take deep breaths.

977
01:02:49.307 --> 01:02:50.641
You did well. Eleven.

978
01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:51.934
You did very well.

979
01:02:57.315 --> 01:02:58.900
I know what happened now.

980
01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:04.030
I killed them. didn't I. Papa?

981
01:03:06.115 --> 01:03:07.325
I killed them all.

982
01:03:07.408 --> 01:03:08.408
Okay. Shh.

983
01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:09.994
I killed them all.

984
01:03:23.216 --> 01:03:25.134
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. slow down.

985
01:03:25.218 --> 01:03:26.218
Slow down. guys.

986
01:03:33.726 --> 01:03:35.520
- Whoa.
- Wait. wait. wait.

987
01:03:37.104 --> 01:03:39.565
They're stopping. What
are they stopping for?

988
01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:40.983
Guys. what's going on?

989
01:03:41.692 --> 01:03:42.902
Come on. talk to me.

990
01:03:42.903 --> 01:03:43.903
What's going on?

991
01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:45.930
Uh. Dustin. your compass has gone

992
01:03:45.931 --> 01:03:48.491
from wonky to wonky
with a capital "aah!"

993
01:03:51.536 --> 01:03:52.870
Steve. what are you doing?

994
01:03:52.954 --> 01:03:54.664
Somebody's gotta go
down and check this out.

995
01:03:54.747 --> 01:03:58.334
Unless one of you three can top
being a Hawkins High swim co-captain

996
01:03:58.417 --> 01:04:00.837
and a certified lifeguard
for three years. then...

997
01:04:01.629 --> 01:04:03.923
it's gotta be me. No
complaints. all right?

998
01:04:04.924 --> 01:04:07.260
Hey. I'm not complaining.

999
01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:09.303
I do not wanna go down there.

1000
01:04:19.188 --> 01:04:20.565
Ugh.

1001
01:04:20.648 --> 01:04:23.442
- When'd Steve get so hairy?
- Right?

1002
01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:25.653
I keep telling him he
needs to tame that jungle.

1003
01:04:25.736 --> 01:04:27.613
but he claims the ladies dig it.

1004
01:04:29.657 --> 01:04:30.867
Let me see.

1005
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:31.950
What?

1006
01:04:44.213 --> 01:04:45.214
Hey.

1007
01:04:45.798 --> 01:04:46.883
Good luck.

1008
01:04:46.966 --> 01:04:47.966
Thanks.

1009
01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:52.554
Gross.

1010
01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:57.226
Steve?

1011
01:05:00.104 --> 01:05:01.104
Be careful.

1012
01:05:23.252 --> 01:05:25.630
You guys realize. if
there's a gate down there.

1013
01:05:25.713 --> 01:05:27.506
it's technically a water gate.

1014
01:05:30.134 --> 01:05:31.260
Watergate.

1015
01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:00.289
Where we at. Wheeler?

1016
01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:02.249
- Closing in on a minute.
- Okay.

1017
01:06:04.502 --> 01:06:06.712
Come on. Steve. Come on.

1018
01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:12.385
- Down by the water!
- Shit. Down!

1019
01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:14.345
Shit. Shit.

1020
01:06:14.428 --> 01:06:16.138
It was on this shoreline.

1021
01:06:54.635 --> 01:06:55.635
Oh Christ!

1022
01:06:56.454 --> 01:06:57.513
I found it.

1023
01:06:57.513 --> 01:06:59.974
- You found it?
- I found it. Yeah. I found it.

1024
01:07:00.057 --> 01:07:02.768
Dustin. you are a goddamn Einstein.

1025
01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:05.396
Steve found the gate...

1026
01:07:05.479 --> 01:07:08.024
- Cops.
- Shit. shit. shit.

1027
01:07:08.107 --> 01:07:09.817
We can't let 'em find Eddie.

1028
01:07:11.485 --> 01:07:12.485
Stay with me.

1029
01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:13.821
Hey. officers!

1030
01:07:13.904 --> 01:07:16.532
- Max!
- Over here! I found the killer! This way!

1031
01:07:16.615 --> 01:07:17.867
- Shit.
- Go!

1032
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:19.035
It's pretty wild.

1033
01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:20.911
It's more a snack-size
gate than the mama gate.

1034
01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:23.289
but still. it's pretty damn big.

1035
01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:30.880
Steve!

1036
01:07:34.341 --> 01:07:35.968
- Steve! Steve!
- No! No!

1037
01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:39.555
- What the hell was that. man?
- Nancy. really. what happened?

1038
01:07:39.638 --> 01:07:40.638
Jesus!

1039
01:07:49.273 --> 01:07:50.524
Stop!

1040
01:07:51.233 --> 01:07:52.693
Get back here. you little rats!

1041
01:07:55.988 --> 01:07:57.114
Wait. wait. wait.

1042
01:07:57.198 --> 01:08:00.076
- You're not going in there. are you?
- Just wait here.

1043
01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:01.827
- No. Nancy!
- Nancy!

1044
01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:03.495
Goddamn it!

1045
01:08:17.176 --> 01:08:18.511
Dustin! Shit.

1046
01:08:21.222 --> 01:08:22.264
Hey there.

1047
01:08:24.809 --> 01:08:26.143
No. no. no. no. no. no.

1048
01:08:26.227 --> 01:08:28.062
What are you doing? She said wait.

1049
01:08:28.145 --> 01:08:29.146
Yeah. I heard her.

1050
01:08:29.855 --> 01:08:30.856
She's in charge.

1051
01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:32.108
Are you kidding me?

1052
01:08:32.775 --> 01:08:34.110
I made that shit up.

1053
01:08:34.693 --> 01:08:36.195
Don't you go. Don't you...

1054
01:08:36.737 --> 01:08:39.073
Goddamn it...

1055
01:08:39.156 --> 01:08:41.200
Son of a bitch!

1056
01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:43.035
Oh. this is so stupid.

1057
01:08:43.119 --> 01:08:45.830
This is so stupid. This is
so stupid. Shit! Shit! Shit!
