2
00:00:40.877 --> 00:00:42.003
What have you done?

3
00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:53.515
What have you done?

4
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:31.301
All done.

5
00:01:32.804 --> 00:01:34.472
Not so bad. was it?

6
00:01:35.724 --> 00:01:36.724
See?

7
00:01:37.726 --> 00:01:39.477
There's nothing to be afraid of.

8
00:01:40.061 --> 00:01:41.354
Is there. Nancy?

9
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:46.860
Why don't you take a seat?

10
00:01:49.863 --> 00:01:51.656
No!

11
00:01:59.664 --> 00:02:01.416
Nancy. just stay with
me. Stay with me. okay?

12
00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:03.293
Whatever you guys are doing. hurry up!

13
00:02:04.961 --> 00:02:07.005
Steve says you need to hurry!

14
00:02:07.088 --> 00:02:09.591
- Yeah? No shit!
- We're trying. We can't find anything.

15
00:02:09.674 --> 00:02:12.427
- What is all this shit?
- What are you even looking for?

16
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.889
Madonna. Blondie. Bowie.
Beatles? Music! We need music!

17
00:02:15.972 --> 00:02:18.058
This is music!

18
00:02:25.607 --> 00:02:26.816
Son of a...

19
00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:30.569
God!

20
00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:32.113
Nancy.

21
00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:39.662
What are you doing?

22
00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:43.875
It's not time for you to leave.

23
00:02:51.257 --> 00:02:54.427
Now that you've seen where I've been...

24
00:02:56.054 --> 00:03:00.141
... I would like very much to show you

25
00:03:00.225 --> 00:03:02.393
where I am going.

26
00:03:10.401 --> 00:03:13.780
Take a seat. Nancy.

27
00:03:56.656 --> 00:03:57.656
I...

28
00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:00.326
want you to tell

29
00:04:01.202 --> 00:04:02.453
Eleven.

30
00:04:04.706 --> 00:04:06.791
I want you to tell her

31
00:04:07.584 --> 00:04:10.211
everything you see.

32
00:04:15.592 --> 00:04:16.759
No!

33
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:19.011
No!

34
00:04:20.638 --> 00:04:22.807
- Tell her...
- No!

35
00:04:24.058 --> 00:04:25.310
... everything.

36
00:04:26.811 --> 00:04:27.854
No!

37
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.607
Hey. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

38
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.276
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

39
00:04:34.485 --> 00:04:36.404
It's okay. I'm here.

40
00:04:36.487 --> 00:04:38.531
I'm right here.

41
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:06.119
What's going on there?

42
00:06:06.202 --> 00:06:08.538
Get the power back on!

43
00:06:10.873 --> 00:06:13.167
Tell him that the
prisoners are contained...

44
00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:15.795
and that you're working on the power.

45
00:06:16.838 --> 00:06:17.922
Tell him!

46
00:06:18.006 --> 00:06:19.882
And that door there. where does it lead?

47
00:06:19.966 --> 00:06:21.092
To... to cell block two...

48
00:06:21.592 --> 00:06:23.136
No cell blocks!

49
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.513
I need a safe way out of here.

50
00:06:33.855 --> 00:06:35.481
Guess you got my message. huh?

51
00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:40.611
Oh. no. I just have always
wanted to visit the Soviet Union.

52
00:06:41.154 --> 00:06:42.280
With Murray.

53
00:06:42.905 --> 00:06:44.032
You two getting along?

54
00:06:45.533 --> 00:06:48.494
He's the Starsky to my Hutch.

55
00:06:50.288 --> 00:06:51.497
I thought you were dead.

56
00:06:54.292 --> 00:06:55.460
Thought I lost you.

57
00:06:58.588 --> 00:07:00.214
I did lose you.

58
00:07:01.591 --> 00:07:03.301
For eight months.

59
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.305
We had a funeral.

60
00:07:09.432 --> 00:07:10.641
Anybody show?

61
00:07:11.225 --> 00:07:12.226
Are you kidding?

62
00:07:13.102 --> 00:07:15.605
You're the hero of Hawkins.

63
00:07:17.648 --> 00:07:18.775
It's true.

64
00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:24.030
Yeah. I always felt I'd be
easier to like when I was dead.

65
00:07:28.284 --> 00:07:29.284
How about El?

66
00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:31.204
She's good.

67
00:07:33.956 --> 00:07:35.541
She misses her dad.

68
00:07:37.126 --> 00:07:38.294
We all do.

69
00:07:40.046 --> 00:07:41.964
Uh. I hate to interrupt.

70
00:07:42.048 --> 00:07:44.926
but apparently. they can climb too.

71
00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:52.058
Lower your weapons.

72
00:07:52.141 --> 00:07:53.726
Lower your weapons!

73
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.104
Don't shoot!

74
00:08:01.734 --> 00:08:03.319
Stop!

75
00:08:08.866 --> 00:08:09.909
The hell is that?

76
00:08:09.992 --> 00:08:13.371
Please tell me they don't have
another one of those things.

77
00:08:25.466 --> 00:08:26.843
You can't go in there!

78
00:08:26.926 --> 00:08:27.927
It's dangerous!

79
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.139
It's dangerous!

80
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.597
Oh my God.

81
00:10:10.821 --> 00:10:12.448
The hell are they doing?

82
00:10:46.148 --> 00:10:47.233
Hey.

83
00:10:48.359 --> 00:10:49.402
Found something.

84
00:10:59.787 --> 00:11:03.207
- Think this'll lead us outta here?
- I give it a hundred to one odds.

85
00:11:19.098 --> 00:11:21.309
And one. two. three.

86
00:11:23.311 --> 00:11:25.021
And one. two. three.

87
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.233
Again. One. two. three.

88
00:11:35.781 --> 00:11:37.908
Pulse is dropping.
One-fifty now. BP's 160...

89
00:11:43.456 --> 00:11:44.456
How do you feel?

90
00:11:45.458 --> 00:11:46.792
Can you hear us?

91
00:11:48.377 --> 00:11:50.212
Eleven. Can you hear us?

92
00:11:55.968 --> 00:11:57.219
No. leave her.

93
00:11:58.679 --> 00:12:00.014
Hi. Jane.

94
00:14:31.749 --> 00:14:35.169
Holy shit. dude. Check it out.

95
00:14:35.252 --> 00:14:38.297
I didn't know they expanded into Nevada.

96
00:14:40.466 --> 00:14:41.759
Watch out. Domino's.

97
00:14:42.426 --> 00:14:44.637
Your dominoes are gonna fall.

98
00:14:47.014 --> 00:14:48.390
How far is Nina from Vegas?

99
00:14:48.474 --> 00:14:49.475
From Vegas?

100
00:14:49.558 --> 00:14:52.144
Um. as long as Suzie's
coordinates are right.

101
00:14:52.228 --> 00:14:54.021
about another 90 miles. Why?

102
00:14:54.104 --> 00:14:57.566
Well. once we save her. El.
we should stop on the way back.

103
00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:01.111
El could make us. like. super
rich. and we'd never have to work.

104
00:15:01.195 --> 00:15:04.949
We could just play D&D and
Nintendo for the rest of our lives.

105
00:15:05.032 --> 00:15:06.742
Yeah. Totally.

106
00:15:10.704 --> 00:15:12.498
We're gonna make it.
Mike. She's gonna be okay.

107
00:15:12.581 --> 00:15:14.416
Yeah. I know. I... I know she is.

108
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.170
But... But what if after
all this is over. she...

109
00:15:19.922 --> 00:15:21.549
sh... she doesn't need me anymore?

110
00:15:21.632 --> 00:15:23.425
No. o... of course
she'll still need you.

111
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:25.052
She'll always need you. Mike.

112
00:15:25.135 --> 00:15:26.846
I keep telling myself that. but I...

113
00:15:28.013 --> 00:15:29.223
I don't believe it.

114
00:15:29.306 --> 00:15:31.809
I mean. she's special.

115
00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:33.394
She was born special.

116
00:15:33.477 --> 00:15:36.063
Maybe I was one of the
first people to realize that.

117
00:15:36.856 --> 00:15:39.400
But the truth is. when I
stumbled on her in the woods.

118
00:15:39.483 --> 00:15:40.901
she just needed someone.

119
00:15:40.985 --> 00:15:44.488
It's not fate. It's... It's not
destiny. It's just simple dumb luck.

120
00:15:44.572 --> 00:15:47.199
And one day she's gonna realize
I'm just some random nerd

121
00:15:47.283 --> 00:15:49.368
that got lucky that Superman
landed on his doorstep.

122
00:15:49.451 --> 00:15:51.328
I mean. at least Lois Lane

123
00:15:51.412 --> 00:15:53.831
is an ace reporter for the
Daily Planet. right? But...

124
00:15:56.166 --> 00:15:57.209
- Sorry.
- No.

125
00:15:57.293 --> 00:16:00.296
No. i... it's so stupid. given
everything that's going on.

126
00:16:00.379 --> 00:16:02.673
It's just... I... I
don't know. I just...

127
00:16:03.007 --> 00:16:04.007
Uh...

128
00:16:04.049 --> 00:16:05.551
You're scared of losing her.

129
00:16:08.387 --> 00:16:10.180
Can I show you something?

130
00:16:31.035 --> 00:16:32.119
This is amazing.

131
00:16:33.037 --> 00:16:34.079
Did you paint this?

132
00:16:34.872 --> 00:16:36.624
Yeah. Yeah. I mean...

133
00:16:36.707 --> 00:16:38.959
I mean... I mean. El asked me to.

134
00:16:39.043 --> 00:16:42.379
She commissioned it. basically.
I mean. she told me what to draw.

135
00:16:42.463 --> 00:16:44.173
Anyway. my point is.

136
00:16:45.132 --> 00:16:46.467
see how you're leading us here?

137
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.761
You're guiding the whole
party. inspiring us.

138
00:16:48.844 --> 00:16:50.346
That... That's what you do.

139
00:16:50.429 --> 00:16:52.932
And see your coat of
arms here? It's a heart.

140
00:16:53.015 --> 00:16:54.475
And I know it's sort of on the nose.

141
00:16:54.558 --> 00:16:56.977
but that's what holds
this party together. Heart.

142
00:16:57.061 --> 00:17:01.065
Because. I mean. without
heart. we'd all fall apart.

143
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.859
Even El. Especially El.

144
00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:10.115
These past few months. she's
been so lost without you.

145
00:17:10.199 --> 00:17:14.203
It's just. she's so different
from other people. and...

146
00:17:14.912 --> 00:17:17.873
... when you're...
when you're different.

147
00:17:17.957 --> 00:17:19.375
sometimes...

148
00:17:19.458 --> 00:17:21.919
... you feel like a mistake.

149
00:17:23.337 --> 00:17:26.090
But you make her feel like
she's not a mistake at all.

150
00:17:26.173 --> 00:17:28.092
Like she's better for being different.

151
00:17:28.175 --> 00:17:29.802
And that gives her the
courage to fight on.

152
00:17:29.885 --> 00:17:31.387
If she was mean to you

153
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:33.639
or she seemed like she
was pushing you away.

154
00:17:33.722 --> 00:17:35.350
it's because she's scared of losing you.

155
00:17:35.351 --> 00:17:36.725
like you're scared of losing her.

156
00:17:36.809 --> 00:17:38.519
And if she was going to lose you.

157
00:17:38.602 --> 00:17:40.771
I... I think she'd rather
just get it over with quick.

158
00:17:40.854 --> 00:17:42.272
Like ripping off a Band-Aid.

159
00:17:43.607 --> 00:17:45.776
So. yeah. El needs you. Mike.

160
00:17:45.859 --> 00:17:47.361
And she always will.

161
00:17:48.946 --> 00:17:50.114
Yeah?

162
00:17:51.031 --> 00:17:52.031
Yeah.

163
00:18:54.887 --> 00:18:56.388
After the attack.

164
00:18:56.472 --> 00:18:57.765
you fell into a coma.

165
00:18:58.891 --> 00:19:02.311
Like One. you had pushed
yourself beyond your limit.

166
00:19:03.812 --> 00:19:05.773
And it very nearly destroyed you.

167
00:19:07.274 --> 00:19:09.443
But that is where your
similarities ended.

168
00:19:10.944 --> 00:19:12.654
What you displayed that day

169
00:19:13.572 --> 00:19:15.491
was beyond anything I'd ever imagined.

170
00:19:16.658 --> 00:19:18.744
A potential I'd only dreamed of.

171
00:19:24.792 --> 00:19:25.959
But when you awoke.

172
00:19:27.461 --> 00:19:28.879
something had been lost.

173
00:19:29.963 --> 00:19:31.048
Your memories.

174
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:34.676
along with whatever else you'd
found within yourself that day.

175
00:19:35.761 --> 00:19:38.097
But I knew then. just as I knew today.

176
00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.182
that your powers had not been lost.

177
00:19:40.265 --> 00:19:42.935
They just needed a spark.

178
00:19:45.229 --> 00:19:46.355
But that day.

179
00:19:47.272 --> 00:19:48.941
you awakened something else.

180
00:19:49.024 --> 00:19:51.068
A doorway to another world.

181
00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.907
I always thought that
Henry was out there.

182
00:19:57.616 --> 00:19:59.159
hiding in the darkness.

183
00:20:00.911 --> 00:20:04.123
I didn't know for sure.
not beyond a feeling.

184
00:20:05.874 --> 00:20:06.874
Until now.

185
00:20:09.211 --> 00:20:12.923
He's claimed three victims so
far. and when I saw the eyes.

186
00:20:13.715 --> 00:20:15.509
I knew... I knew that was him.

187
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.596
He was sending us a message.
letting us know he's back.

188
00:20:21.265 --> 00:20:22.891
That's when I came to see you.

189
00:20:28.856 --> 00:20:30.023
My friends.

190
00:20:30.607 --> 00:20:32.693
Well. we... we haven't risked contact.

191
00:20:32.776 --> 00:20:34.653
but. as far as we know.

192
00:20:34.736 --> 00:20:36.572
they're... they're all safe.

193
00:20:37.781 --> 00:20:39.867
But I'm not gonna lie to you. Eleven.

194
00:20:40.868 --> 00:20:42.369
Your friends are in terrible danger.

195
00:20:43.162 --> 00:20:44.872
With each victim he takes.

196
00:20:44.955 --> 00:20:45.955
Henry is...

197
00:20:47.166 --> 00:20:50.961
chiseling away at the barrier
that exists between our two worlds.

198
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:52.671
"Chiseling"?

199
00:20:53.255 --> 00:20:54.756
Imagine. if you will.

200
00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.092
the barrier between our worlds is a...

201
00:20:57.926 --> 00:20:59.052
concrete dam.

202
00:21:00.679 --> 00:21:03.515
Henry is putting cracks in this dam.

203
00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:06.268
Cracks in dams

204
00:21:06.351 --> 00:21:07.519
create pressure.

205
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.771
Left unchecked.

206
00:21:10.814 --> 00:21:12.274
the pressure will build.

207
00:21:12.983 --> 00:21:14.276
And build.

208
00:21:14.359 --> 00:21:16.945
And eventually. it will
reach a breaking point.

209
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.573
And the dam will burst.

210
00:21:21.074 --> 00:21:22.409
And when that happens.

211
00:21:23.702 --> 00:21:24.995
Hawkins will fall.

212
00:21:31.793 --> 00:21:33.921
Well. that went very well. I thought.

213
00:21:34.004 --> 00:21:37.090
You eased her into it. nice and
gentle. just like we talked about.

214
00:21:37.174 --> 00:21:38.467
Not ominous at all.

215
00:22:20.676 --> 00:22:22.344
He showed me

216
00:22:23.136 --> 00:22:25.639
things that haven't happened yet.

217
00:22:27.349 --> 00:22:29.434
The most awful things.

218
00:22:33.063 --> 00:22:34.106
I saw

219
00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.441
a dark cloud

220
00:22:37.276 --> 00:22:39.027
spreading over Hawkins.

221
00:22:39.778 --> 00:22:41.613
Downtown on fire.

222
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:44.408
Dead soldiers.

223
00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:47.660
And this...

224
00:22:49.079 --> 00:22:51.290
giant creature

225
00:22:52.082 --> 00:22:55.335
with... a gaping mouth.

226
00:22:55.419 --> 00:22:57.212
And this creature wasn't alone.

227
00:22:58.171 --> 00:23:00.340
There were so many monsters.

228
00:23:02.259 --> 00:23:03.260
An army.

229
00:23:04.761 --> 00:23:07.180
And they were coming into Hawkins.

230
00:23:08.181 --> 00:23:09.683
Into our neighborhoods.

231
00:23:11.184 --> 00:23:12.184
Our homes.

232
00:23:13.145 --> 00:23:14.145
And then...

233
00:23:16.106 --> 00:23:18.108
he showed me my mom.

234
00:23:20.068 --> 00:23:21.111
And Holly.

235
00:23:22.904 --> 00:23:23.904
Mike.

236
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.240
And they...

237
00:23:28.285 --> 00:23:29.369
they were all...

238
00:23:34.666 --> 00:23:38.378
Okay. but... he's just
trying to scare you. Nance.

239
00:23:39.296 --> 00:23:40.297
Right? I mean...

240
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:42.716
I mean. it's not real.

241
00:23:42.799 --> 00:23:43.842
Not yet.

242
00:23:46.094 --> 00:23:49.056
But there... there was something else.

243
00:23:50.515 --> 00:23:52.559
He showed me gates.

244
00:23:54.186 --> 00:23:55.729
Four gates.

245
00:23:56.897 --> 00:23:58.982
Spreading across Hawkins.

246
00:23:59.608 --> 00:24:03.779
And these gates. they looked like
the one outside of Eddie's trailer.

247
00:24:03.862 --> 00:24:06.448
but... they didn't stop growing.

248
00:24:06.531 --> 00:24:09.368
And this wasn't the Upside Down Hawkins.

249
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.953
This was our Hawkins.

250
00:24:13.955 --> 00:24:14.955
Our home.

251
00:24:17.709 --> 00:24:18.919
Four chimes.

252
00:24:21.046 --> 00:24:22.046
Vecna's clock.

253
00:24:23.673 --> 00:24:25.342
It always chimes four times.

254
00:24:27.511 --> 00:24:28.511
Four exactly.

255
00:24:29.679 --> 00:24:30.806
I heard them too.

256
00:24:36.228 --> 00:24:38.355
He's been telling us
his plan this whole time.

257
00:24:39.106 --> 00:24:40.399
Four kills.

258
00:24:41.691 --> 00:24:42.901
Four gates.

259
00:24:46.696 --> 00:24:47.989
End of the world.

260
00:24:48.073 --> 00:24:49.282
If that's true...

261
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:52.786
he's only one kill away.

262
00:24:52.869 --> 00:24:55.705
Oh Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.

263
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:57.165
Try 'em again. Try 'em again.

264
00:25:10.429 --> 00:25:11.888
- Anything?
- No.

265
00:25:11.972 --> 00:25:13.682
Rang a few times. then
went to busy signal.

266
00:25:13.765 --> 00:25:15.517
Maybe you punched it wrong. Try again.

267
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.145
- I didn't punch it in wrong.
- Well. I don't know.

268
00:25:18.228 --> 00:25:19.980
I think she knows how to use a phone.

269
00:25:20.063 --> 00:25:22.315
I'm just saying. she
could've typed it in wrong.

270
00:25:25.735 --> 00:25:28.029
- Same shit.
- How is that possible?

271
00:25:28.113 --> 00:25:30.782
Joyce has this telemarketer
job. Always on the phone.

272
00:25:30.866 --> 00:25:32.242
Mike won't stop whining about it.

273
00:25:32.325 --> 00:25:35.704
Yeah. but this phone's been
busy for. what. three days now?

274
00:25:36.204 --> 00:25:37.289
That's not Joyce.

275
00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:39.666
No way. Something's wrong.

276
00:25:40.625 --> 00:25:41.835
She's right.

277
00:25:41.918 --> 00:25:44.671
It can't be just
coincidence. It can't be.

278
00:25:45.672 --> 00:25:49.092
Whatever's happening in Lenora
is connected to all of this.

279
00:25:49.176 --> 00:25:50.177
I'm sure of it.

280
00:25:53.054 --> 00:25:54.598
But Vecna can't hurt them.

281
00:25:56.725 --> 00:25:58.185
Not if he's dead.

282
00:25:58.268 --> 00:26:01.271
We have to go back in there.
Back to the Upside Down.

283
00:26:01.354 --> 00:26:03.106
- Whoa. no. no. no. What?
- Nope.

284
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.567
- Let's think this through.
- What is there to think through?

285
00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:08.445
- We barely made it out of there.
- Yeah. because we weren't prepared.

286
00:26:08.528 --> 00:26:11.865
But this time. we will be.
We'll get weapons and protection.

287
00:26:11.948 --> 00:26:14.993
We'll go through the gate. we'll
find his lair. and we'll kill him.

288
00:26:15.076 --> 00:26:16.286
Or he'll kill us.

289
00:26:16.369 --> 00:26:19.372
The only reason you survived
is because he wanted you to.

290
00:26:19.456 --> 00:26:22.125
- He's not scared of us.
- And for good reason.

291
00:26:22.209 --> 00:26:25.378
We were wrong about Vecna. Henry. One.

292
00:26:25.462 --> 00:26:26.880
Sorry. what are we calling him now?

293
00:26:26.963 --> 00:26:28.048
- One.
- Vecna.

294
00:26:28.131 --> 00:26:29.341
- Henry.
- Right.

295
00:26:29.424 --> 00:26:31.885
We've learned something
new about Vecna/Henry/One.

296
00:26:31.968 --> 00:26:34.600
He's a number like Eleven.
only a sick. evil. male.

297
00:26:34.601 --> 00:26:36.556
child-murdering version of
her with really bad skin.

298
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.267
But my... my point is.
he's super powerful.

299
00:26:39.351 --> 00:26:41.042
Could turn us inside out
with a snap of his fingers.

300
00:26:41.043 --> 00:26:42.312
It's not a fair fight.

301
00:26:42.395 --> 00:26:43.897
Then why fight fair?

302
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.317
You're right. He's like Eleven.
But that gives us an upper hand.

303
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.069
We know Eleven's strengths.

304
00:26:49.152 --> 00:26:51.196
And weaknesses.

305
00:26:51.279 --> 00:26:52.614
Weaknesses?

306
00:26:52.697 --> 00:26:54.157
When El remote-travels.

307
00:26:54.241 --> 00:26:57.953
she goes into this sort
of trance-like state.

308
00:26:58.036 --> 00:26:59.329
I bet the same is true of Vecna.

309
00:26:59.412 --> 00:27:01.540
That would explain what
he was doing in that attic.

310
00:27:01.623 --> 00:27:04.000
Exactly. When he
attacks his next victim.

311
00:27:04.084 --> 00:27:07.546
I'll bet you he's back in that
attic. physical body defenseless.

312
00:27:07.629 --> 00:27:09.714
Defenseless? What
about the army of bats?

313
00:27:09.798 --> 00:27:12.050
True. We'll have to
find a way past them.

314
00:27:12.133 --> 00:27:13.343
Distract them somehow.

315
00:27:13.426 --> 00:27:15.887
- And. uh. how do we do that. exactly?
- No idea.

316
00:27:15.971 --> 00:27:17.681
But once they're gone.

317
00:27:17.764 --> 00:27:19.182
he doesn't stand a chance.

318
00:27:19.266 --> 00:27:22.227
It'll be like slaying
sleeping Dracula in his coffin.

319
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:23.895
That all sounds good in theory.

320
00:27:23.979 --> 00:27:25.981
but there is no pattern
to Vecna's killings.

321
00:27:26.064 --> 00:27:27.566
Not one that I can decipher.

322
00:27:27.649 --> 00:27:29.734
We don't know when he's
going to attack next.

323
00:27:29.818 --> 00:27:32.612
- Don't even know who he's going to attack.
- Yeah. we do.

324
00:27:33.238 --> 00:27:34.698
I can still feel him.

325
00:27:34.781 --> 00:27:37.033
I'm still marked.

326
00:27:38.368 --> 00:27:39.369
Cursed.

327
00:27:41.329 --> 00:27:42.581
I ditch Kate Bush.

328
00:27:43.498 --> 00:27:44.791
I draw his focus back to me.

329
00:27:44.874 --> 00:27:46.042
Max.

330
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:48.210
You can't.

331
00:27:48.753 --> 00:27:50.046
He'll kill you.

332
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:51.881
I survived before.

333
00:27:54.467 --> 00:27:55.552
I can survive again.

334
00:27:57.012 --> 00:27:59.900
I just need to keep him busy long enough

335
00:27:59.901 --> 00:28:01.474
so that you guys can
get into that attic.

336
00:28:01.558 --> 00:28:03.977
Then you can chop his head off.

337
00:28:04.769 --> 00:28:08.064
Stab him in the heart. Blow him up
with some explosive Dustin cooks up.

338
00:28:08.148 --> 00:28:11.401
I honestly don't care how you
put this asshole in his grave.

339
00:28:11.402 --> 00:28:12.402
Just...

340
00:28:14.863 --> 00:28:15.905
... whatever it is...

341
00:28:18.241 --> 00:28:19.241
whatever you do...

342
00:28:22.912 --> 00:28:23.913
try not to miss.

343
00:29:58.174 --> 00:29:59.217
Bam.

344
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:00.300
Durak.

345
00:30:00.301 --> 00:30:01.761
Son of a bitch!

346
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:29.080
Sayonara!

347
00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.088
Oh God! Oh God!

348
00:30:44.304 --> 00:30:45.972
Son of a bitch!

349
00:30:51.478 --> 00:30:53.021
- You okay? All right?
- Yeah.

350
00:30:53.104 --> 00:30:55.899
- You okay?
- Okay? I'm great! Whoo!

351
00:30:56.524 --> 00:30:58.400
Oh. nothing like a little prison escape

352
00:30:58.401 --> 00:31:00.653
to get your day started. am I right?

353
00:31:00.737 --> 00:31:02.071
We're not out of the woods yet.

354
00:31:02.155 --> 00:31:05.283
My people do not take kindly to
escapes. They'll be hunting us.

355
00:31:05.366 --> 00:31:09.037
Yeah. well. we aren't exactly
planning on sticking around.

356
00:31:09.954 --> 00:31:13.792
- Where's the plane you came in on?
- That plane? Um. that crashed.

357
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:16.878
- Crashed?
- His fault.

358
00:31:16.961 --> 00:31:18.963
A word of warning.

359
00:31:19.047 --> 00:31:23.009
That man is more slippery
than an eel dipped in baby oil.

360
00:31:23.092 --> 00:31:24.761
I wouldn't trust a
word out of his mouth.

361
00:31:24.844 --> 00:31:27.347
My tongue. My tongue!

362
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:28.807
I... I can't feel my tongue.

363
00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:31.518
We need to get out of
here. back to the States.

364
00:31:31.601 --> 00:31:33.770
Can you get us to another plane?

365
00:31:33.853 --> 00:31:34.853
Now?

366
00:31:34.896 --> 00:31:36.606
You're asking for Yuri's help

367
00:31:36.689 --> 00:31:39.609
after dragging him through
miles of shit tunnel?

368
00:31:39.692 --> 00:31:43.196
I could have told you we are
going wrong way hours ago.

369
00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:44.614
You Neanderthal...

370
00:31:44.697 --> 00:31:47.158
Watch your mouth. or
I am gonna take this.

371
00:31:47.242 --> 00:31:49.702
I'm gonna rub it along
the bottom of my shoe.

372
00:31:49.786 --> 00:31:53.248
and I'm gonna jam it down your throat.

373
00:31:53.331 --> 00:31:54.791
Well. go ahead!

374
00:31:54.874 --> 00:31:57.877
But then you'll never make
it out of my country alive.

375
00:31:57.961 --> 00:31:59.504
So you can get us out.

376
00:31:59.587 --> 00:32:02.423
For a glass of water and hot steam bath

377
00:32:03.258 --> 00:32:06.261
and five-inch stack of American dollars.

378
00:32:06.344 --> 00:32:09.973
Yuri will fly you to moon.

379
00:32:10.056 --> 00:32:12.725
You make another demand.
you double-crossing mudak.

380
00:32:13.601 --> 00:32:15.687
I'll decorate the roof of
this van with your brains.

381
00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:19.065
Why so angry. comrade?

382
00:32:19.148 --> 00:32:21.609
Rough couple of days for you. I'm sure.

383
00:32:22.193 --> 00:32:23.862
But now you are free.

384
00:32:23.945 --> 00:32:26.990
Everything works out.
Happy ending for everybody.

385
00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:28.408
No?

386
00:32:28.408 --> 00:32:33.621
For you. that will very much
depend on how you answer. Comrade.

387
00:32:34.205 --> 00:32:36.207
Will you take us to America?

388
00:32:36.291 --> 00:32:37.375
Yes?

389
00:32:40.737 --> 00:32:41.796
Or no?

390
00:32:50.054 --> 00:32:52.223
Check this out. The War Zone.

391
00:32:53.057 --> 00:32:55.435
I've been there once. It's huge.

392
00:32:55.435 --> 00:32:58.146
They got everything you need for. uh...

393
00:32:58.688 --> 00:33:00.648
well. killing things. basically.

394
00:33:00.732 --> 00:33:02.442
You think fake Rambo
has enough guns there?

395
00:33:02.525 --> 00:33:05.111
Is that a grenade? I mean.
how is any of this legal?

396
00:33:05.194 --> 00:33:07.155
Well. lucky for us it is. so...

397
00:33:07.238 --> 00:33:10.116
This... This place is just
far enough outside of Hawkins.

398
00:33:10.199 --> 00:33:12.243
As long as we steer clear of main roads.

399
00:33:12.327 --> 00:33:15.663
we oughta be able to avoid
cops and. uh. angry hicks.

400
00:33:15.747 --> 00:33:17.665
If we're trying to avoid angry hicks.

401
00:33:17.749 --> 00:33:20.501
maybe we shouldn't go to some
store called the War Zone.

402
00:33:20.585 --> 00:33:23.338
Normally. I'd agree.
but we need the weapons.

403
00:33:23.421 --> 00:33:25.757
- So I think it's worth the risk.
- Me too.

404
00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.927
But is it worth the time? It'll
take all day to bike there and back.

405
00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:31.971
- Who said anything about bikes?
- You got some car we don't know about?

406
00:33:32.055 --> 00:33:34.557
It's not exactly a car. Steve.

407
00:33:35.266 --> 00:33:36.267
And it's not exactly mine.

408
00:33:36.351 --> 00:33:38.728
but. uh... it'll do.

409
00:33:39.729 --> 00:33:44.567
Hey. Red. uh. you got a ski mask
or a bandanna. something like that?

410
00:34:22.647 --> 00:34:23.982
That was suffocating.

411
00:34:25.608 --> 00:34:26.608
Go! Come on.

412
00:34:39.414 --> 00:34:41.165
Where'd you learn how to do this?

413
00:34:41.249 --> 00:34:43.171
Well. when the other dads
were teaching their kids

414
00:34:43.172 --> 00:34:45.169
how to fish or play ball.

415
00:34:45.253 --> 00:34:47.839
my old man was teaching
me how to hot-wire.

416
00:34:47.922 --> 00:34:52.260
Now. I swore to myself I
wouldn't wind up like he did.

417
00:34:52.343 --> 00:34:54.971
but now I'm wanted for murder.

418
00:34:55.054 --> 00:34:56.848
and soon. grand theft auto.

419
00:34:56.931 --> 00:34:59.767
So. uh. I'm really living
up to that Munson name.

420
00:34:59.851 --> 00:35:03.146
Eddie. I'm not sure I love
the idea of you driving.

421
00:35:03.229 --> 00:35:06.441
Oh. I'm just starting this
sucker. Harrington's got her.

422
00:35:06.524 --> 00:35:07.775
Don't ya. big boy?

423
00:35:11.279 --> 00:35:12.572
What the hell?

424
00:35:12.655 --> 00:35:14.198
Hey! Open this door!

425
00:35:14.282 --> 00:35:17.076
- Hey!
- They locked the door!

426
00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.161
Shit! Go.

427
00:35:19.287 --> 00:35:21.789
It's just a car. Everybody.
hang on to something!

428
00:35:21.873 --> 00:35:23.374
Oh my God! Let's go! Let's go!

429
00:35:23.458 --> 00:35:25.418
Drive. Steve! Drive!

430
00:35:25.501 --> 00:35:26.711
Go. go. go!

431
00:35:31.257 --> 00:35:33.342
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

432
00:35:33.426 --> 00:35:34.802
Shit. they look pissed.

433
00:35:34.886 --> 00:35:38.097
It's not every day you lose your
house and car in one fell swoop.

434
00:35:40.016 --> 00:35:41.225
Hold on! Hold on!

435
00:35:46.856 --> 00:35:47.857
Them!

436
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.193
Stop 'em! God bless it!

437
00:35:50.276 --> 00:35:51.527
Okay.

438
00:36:18.179 --> 00:36:21.057
My friends. I saw them.
You told me they were safe.

439
00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:23.684
- They are not safe.
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. okay.

440
00:36:23.768 --> 00:36:25.770
Uh. just give us a second. please.

441
00:36:26.687 --> 00:36:27.687
Please.

442
00:36:28.898 --> 00:36:31.067
Okay. okay. first... first things first.

443
00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:33.861
We're not gonna let anything
happen to your friends. okay. kiddo?

444
00:36:33.945 --> 00:36:35.905
I will personally make sure of that.

445
00:36:36.489 --> 00:36:38.616
Did... Did you see where they were?

446
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:41.452
They were at... They
were at Max's house.

447
00:36:41.536 --> 00:36:43.287
They're planning to kill him.

448
00:36:43.371 --> 00:36:44.413
To kill Henry.

449
00:36:44.497 --> 00:36:46.499
Okay. Okay.

450
00:36:47.333 --> 00:36:49.377
This... Does this Max have a last name?

451
00:36:50.086 --> 00:36:52.046
Max... Max Mayfield.

452
00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:53.965
Okay. So here's what's gonna happen.

453
00:36:54.048 --> 00:36:58.010
I have people in Hawkins. and I'm
gonna send some to Max Mayfield.

454
00:36:58.094 --> 00:36:59.846
- And they will stop him...
- Her.

455
00:36:59.929 --> 00:37:02.223
Stop her. And the rest of them

456
00:37:02.306 --> 00:37:04.767
from whatever foolish. although
well-intentioned. mission

457
00:37:04.851 --> 00:37:06.144
that they're attempting. all right?

458
00:37:06.227 --> 00:37:08.604
No. No. do not send your men.

459
00:37:08.688 --> 00:37:09.688
Send me.

460
00:37:09.689 --> 00:37:12.984
Your friends are not prepared
for this fight. Eleven.

461
00:37:14.277 --> 00:37:15.278
And neither are you.

462
00:37:17.071 --> 00:37:18.447
You must understand.

463
00:37:18.531 --> 00:37:21.284
when One kills. he doesn't simply kill.

464
00:37:21.909 --> 00:37:23.119
He consumes.

465
00:37:24.078 --> 00:37:25.997
He takes everything from his victims.

466
00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.708
Everything they are and
everything they ever will be.

467
00:37:29.208 --> 00:37:31.335
Their memories. their abilities.

468
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:36.674
And we do not know where
he's been these lost years.

469
00:37:37.466 --> 00:37:39.927
But if he has survived this long.

470
00:37:40.011 --> 00:37:41.011
we can only assume

471
00:37:41.012 --> 00:37:43.514
that he has grown in strength.

472
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:46.851
To underestimate him.

473
00:37:47.351 --> 00:37:48.769
to act rashly.

474
00:37:49.353 --> 00:37:50.605
would be very dangerous.

475
00:37:54.233 --> 00:37:56.485
I don't want to upset you. Eleven.

476
00:37:56.569 --> 00:37:59.363
What you've accomplished is
nothing short of a miracle.

477
00:38:01.782 --> 00:38:03.367
You came to me broken.

478
00:38:04.243 --> 00:38:06.204
And you've learned to walk again.

479
00:38:06.913 --> 00:38:08.706
But if you want to stop One.

480
00:38:09.207 --> 00:38:11.542
you will need to do more than walk.

481
00:38:11.626 --> 00:38:13.419
You will need to do more than run.

482
00:38:14.921 --> 00:38:16.464
You will need to fly.

483
00:38:17.632 --> 00:38:18.925
And you're not ready.

484
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.345
My friends need me.

485
00:38:24.222 --> 00:38:26.057
I've stopped him once. I will again.

486
00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:27.934
I'm sorry. You can't.

487
00:38:28.434 --> 00:38:29.560
It's impossible.

488
00:38:29.644 --> 00:38:30.686
Nothing's impossible.

489
00:38:32.104 --> 00:38:34.670
I can call Stinson. She's
got connections at Nellis.

490
00:38:34.671 --> 00:38:35.700
That's two hours away.

491
00:38:35.983 --> 00:38:38.945
And if we hustle. I'll bet we can
be in Hawkins before nightfall.

492
00:38:39.028 --> 00:38:40.446
That would be a grave mistake.

493
00:38:40.529 --> 00:38:42.782
Waiting would be an
even greater mistake.

494
00:38:42.865 --> 00:38:44.200
What if One makes his move

495
00:38:44.283 --> 00:38:46.410
before we've had a
chance to throw a punch?

496
00:38:46.494 --> 00:38:48.037
Then what is the point of all this?

497
00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.122
That's a risk we're
going to have to take.

498
00:38:51.165 --> 00:38:53.334
We pushed her before
and look what happened.

499
00:38:53.417 --> 00:38:56.879
She lifted a 10.000-pound
tank into the goddamn air.

500
00:38:56.963 --> 00:38:58.839
You don't understand
what he's capable of!

501
00:38:58.923 --> 00:39:01.801
Maybe you're right. Or maybe
you are overestimating him.

502
00:39:01.884 --> 00:39:05.429
Either way. doesn't matter
because this is not our choice.

503
00:39:05.513 --> 00:39:07.598
We agreed this was
not gonna be a prison.

504
00:39:07.682 --> 00:39:08.933
We'll show her what this is.

505
00:39:09.016 --> 00:39:10.351
what we can offer.

506
00:39:10.434 --> 00:39:13.938
and then it is her choice
whether she wants to stay or go.

507
00:39:14.021 --> 00:39:15.021
Right. Doc?

508
00:39:16.232 --> 00:39:17.817
You may not agree with it.

509
00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.695
but here she is. standing before us.

510
00:39:21.487 --> 00:39:22.530
making a choice.

511
00:39:24.198 --> 00:39:26.200
You're sure you wanna do this?

512
00:39:29.453 --> 00:39:32.498
Okay. Pack your things.
say your goodbyes.

513
00:40:02.778 --> 00:40:05.781
- How's it handle?
- Not half bad.

514
00:40:06.615 --> 00:40:08.284
Considering that this is a...

515
00:40:09.618 --> 00:40:10.619
house.

516
00:40:10.703 --> 00:40:14.498
âª Yesterday mornin' âª
âª They let me know you were gone... âª

517
00:40:15.875 --> 00:40:16.917
Yeah. it's...

518
00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.629
it's silly. but I... I've actually...

519
00:40:21.714 --> 00:40:25.676
I always had this dream that I'd
have this really... really big family.

520
00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.261
I'm talking. like. uh.

521
00:40:27.345 --> 00:40:29.013
a full brood of Harringtons.

522
00:40:29.096 --> 00:40:30.639
Like. five. six kids.

523
00:40:30.723 --> 00:40:32.725
- Six?
- Yeah. Six little nuggets.

524
00:40:32.808 --> 00:40:34.435
Three girls. three boys.

525
00:40:36.145 --> 00:40:39.982
And... and every summer. I
figured all of us Harringtons.

526
00:40:40.066 --> 00:40:43.903
we would pack into something like this

527
00:40:43.986 --> 00:40:47.114
and... just see the country.

528
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:50.534
You know. the Rockies. Grand Canyon.

529
00:40:50.618 --> 00:40:52.411
maybe Yellowstone.

530
00:40:53.662 --> 00:40:57.792
End up in some beachside
town in California.

531
00:40:57.875 --> 00:41:00.044
Spend a week parked in the sand.

532
00:41:02.922 --> 00:41:04.298
Learn how to surf or something.

533
00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:07.927
That sounds nice.

534
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:10.970
Yeah?

535
00:41:11.389 --> 00:41:12.389
Yeah.

536
00:41:15.309 --> 00:41:18.062
Well. uh. except for the six-kid part.

537
00:41:18.145 --> 00:41:21.065
That sounds like a total nightmare.

538
00:41:21.148 --> 00:41:23.109
If only I had some practice.

539
00:41:24.318 --> 00:41:25.361
All right. Fair.

540
00:41:25.861 --> 00:41:27.613
That's fair.

541
00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:31.784
âª Oh. I've seen fire
and I've seen rain âª

542
00:41:34.203 --> 00:41:38.124
âª I've seen sunny days âª
âª That I thought would never end âª

543
00:41:40.292 --> 00:41:43.754
âª I've seen lonely times âª
âª When I could not find a friend âª

544
00:41:43.838 --> 00:41:44.838
Hey.

545
00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:48.968
âª But I always thought âª
âª That I'd see you again... âª

546
00:41:49.051 --> 00:41:50.302
So I've been thinking.

547
00:41:50.386 --> 00:41:54.223
two of the three of Vecna's victims
were seeing Ms. Kelley. right?

548
00:41:54.306 --> 00:41:55.641
- Yeah.
- Okay.

549
00:41:55.724 --> 00:41:57.875
So I figure there's a good chance

550
00:41:57.876 --> 00:41:59.562
Vecna cursed another
one of her students.

551
00:41:59.645 --> 00:42:02.940
We go back to her office.
We read all of her files.

552
00:42:03.023 --> 00:42:05.734
Look for mentions of headaches.
nosebleeds. nightmares.

553
00:42:05.818 --> 00:42:08.446
- We identify his most likely next victim.
- Lucas.

554
00:42:08.529 --> 00:42:10.156
- We stake out his house...
- Lucas. stop.

555
00:42:10.739 --> 00:42:12.825
We don't have time
for any of that. okay?

556
00:42:13.325 --> 00:42:14.452
And even if we did.

557
00:42:15.161 --> 00:42:17.413
even if your plan did work.

558
00:42:18.247 --> 00:42:20.833
we'd be putting a
total stranger at risk.

559
00:42:20.916 --> 00:42:23.294
A stranger who has no idea
what they're up against.

560
00:42:23.794 --> 00:42:24.794
I do.

561
00:42:26.005 --> 00:42:27.840
He uses my memories against me.

562
00:42:29.175 --> 00:42:32.261
But... only my darkest memories.

563
00:42:32.344 --> 00:42:35.598
- Same with Chrissy and Fred. right?
- Right.

564
00:42:35.681 --> 00:42:38.225
It's like he only sees
the darkness in us.

565
00:42:39.935 --> 00:42:43.564
So. I'll just run in
the opposite direction.

566
00:42:45.733 --> 00:42:46.734
Run to the light.

567
00:42:48.569 --> 00:42:50.946
And maybe he won't be
able to find me there.

568
00:42:52.114 --> 00:42:54.617
Now. how exactly do
you plan on doing this?

569
00:42:56.327 --> 00:42:57.327
I'm not sure.

570
00:42:59.788 --> 00:43:00.956
But it's my mind.

571
00:43:02.291 --> 00:43:03.334
Not his. right?

572
00:43:04.418 --> 00:43:06.754
So I should be able
to control where I am.

573
00:43:06.837 --> 00:43:09.840
I just need to... push him away.

574
00:43:10.966 --> 00:43:13.844
Find a happy memory and hide there.

575
00:43:15.721 --> 00:43:16.889
Hide in the light.

576
00:43:19.642 --> 00:43:21.644
You got a memory in mind?

577
00:43:23.979 --> 00:43:24.979
Yeah.

578
00:43:26.148 --> 00:43:27.525
It was a time when I was

579
00:43:28.776 --> 00:43:30.152
the happiest.

580
00:43:36.992 --> 00:43:39.995
Was I there?

581
00:43:42.831 --> 00:43:44.250
That's presumptuous of you.

582
00:43:46.252 --> 00:43:47.336
But yeah.

583
00:43:48.587 --> 00:43:49.797
You might've been there.

584
00:43:53.801 --> 00:43:55.761
Okay. but the second you start to lift.

585
00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.222
I'm calling in Kate Bush.

586
00:43:58.889 --> 00:44:00.432
- All right?
- Okay.

587
00:44:01.267 --> 00:44:03.269
- Deal.
- Deal.

588
00:44:37.261 --> 00:44:39.346
Heh. come on. This way.

589
00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:44.768
If I get a whiff of any
funny business. smuggler...

590
00:44:44.852 --> 00:44:46.645
I will not hesitate to kill you.

591
00:44:46.729 --> 00:44:50.024
In fact... I am just looking
for a reason. Understand?

592
00:44:50.107 --> 00:44:53.861
Are you a parrot. cop? You
keep repeating the same thing.

593
00:44:53.944 --> 00:44:57.072
You were trapped in a
cell with this dull man

594
00:44:57.156 --> 00:44:59.950
and you didn't take
opportunity to smother him.

595
00:45:12.046 --> 00:45:14.256
Beautiful. yes?

596
00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:16.800
Please tell me this
is another poor joke.

597
00:45:16.884 --> 00:45:20.679
You said you had a plane.

598
00:45:20.763 --> 00:45:22.556
- A plane!
- No. no. no.

599
00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.892
I... I told you I could fly you home.

600
00:45:25.392 --> 00:45:28.604
And Katinka can fly
you home. little bird.

601
00:45:28.687 --> 00:45:32.107
She was named Katinka
after my first lover.

602
00:45:32.191 --> 00:45:36.403
Katinka also had very
beautiful. very round buttocks.

603
00:45:36.487 --> 00:45:38.030
Uh. mu... much like this.

604
00:45:41.533 --> 00:45:44.036
This cannot fly us to America.

605
00:45:44.119 --> 00:45:45.287
Why not?

606
00:45:45.371 --> 00:45:47.539
As long as winds are not too strong

607
00:45:47.623 --> 00:45:51.293
and your military friends
do not shoot us out of sky.

608
00:45:51.377 --> 00:45:52.753
we can make it to the coast.

609
00:45:52.836 --> 00:45:54.797
There. while we refuel.

610
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.716
we skin dip in ice-cold
water and wash off this muck.

611
00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:00.844
Then we fly her rest of the way.

612
00:46:00.928 --> 00:46:02.137
Happy ending.

613
00:46:02.221 --> 00:46:06.058
Okay. what is the furthest
Katinka has ever flown?

614
00:46:07.476 --> 00:46:10.437
For me. she is still a virgin.

615
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:13.982
Uh. not real Katinka. Goodness. no.

616
00:46:16.276 --> 00:46:18.028
That Katinka. no.

617
00:46:18.112 --> 00:46:20.989
But this Katinka. pretty much unspoiled.

618
00:46:21.073 --> 00:46:24.993
But I'm sure she will
soar when given a chance.

619
00:46:25.077 --> 00:46:27.538
She just need little tune-up.

620
00:46:31.166 --> 00:46:33.711
- I did warn you. Jim.
- Okay.

621
00:46:33.794 --> 00:46:35.629
Should I shoot him now? Or later?

622
00:46:35.713 --> 00:46:37.131
What about Owens?

623
00:46:37.214 --> 00:46:42.177
He... He's gotta have contacts
or spies here that could help us.

624
00:46:42.261 --> 00:46:43.387
Can we do that?

625
00:46:44.555 --> 00:46:46.223
Can we make a call to the States?

626
00:46:56.984 --> 00:46:58.819
Yes. hello. miss.

627
00:46:59.361 --> 00:47:03.699
I'd like to place a call to the
United States. A very sick relative.

628
00:47:04.825 --> 00:47:06.744
Correct. Yes... The number is...

629
00:47:07.536 --> 00:47:10.080
- The number?
- It's 775...

630
00:47:10.164 --> 00:47:12.708
... 305...

631
00:47:12.791 --> 00:47:14.376
... 3450.

632
00:47:17.796 --> 00:47:18.797
Da. spasibo.

633
00:47:20.591 --> 00:47:24.094
- What are you doing?
- How exactly do you think this works?

634
00:47:24.178 --> 00:47:27.097
They will make the call for us.
and then they will call us back.

635
00:47:27.181 --> 00:47:28.557
How long's that gonna take?

636
00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:31.643
Five minutes. Five hours.

637
00:47:32.478 --> 00:47:33.812
Five days. Who knows?

638
00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.607
And when we do get the call.

639
00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:38.790
assume the KGB will
be on the other line.

640
00:47:38.791 --> 00:47:40.569
listening to everything you say.

641
00:47:40.652 --> 00:47:41.652
So.

642
00:47:42.529 --> 00:47:44.114
I suggest talking in code.

643
00:47:45.199 --> 00:47:46.408
Say the wrong thing

644
00:47:47.367 --> 00:47:50.078
and they will be on
us like flies on shit.

645
00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:53.040
Welcome to the Soviet Union.

646
00:48:15.145 --> 00:48:17.022
So much for avoiding angry hicks.

647
00:48:17.606 --> 00:48:19.358
Let's be... fast.

648
00:48:19.441 --> 00:48:20.901
- Yep.
- Definitely.

649
00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:36.250
- How many of these do you think we need?
- Five or six.

650
00:48:45.759 --> 00:48:47.678
What are you gonna do? Stand and gawk?

651
00:48:47.761 --> 00:48:48.761
Shut up.

652
00:48:50.347 --> 00:48:51.347
Ah!

653
00:48:52.349 --> 00:48:54.101
Jesus. you scared me.

654
00:48:54.184 --> 00:48:56.311
Whoa. You gonna mace me with that?

655
00:48:56.395 --> 00:48:58.522
If it keeps you in line. yeah.

656
00:49:05.779 --> 00:49:08.031
See? Not so scary.

657
00:49:17.165 --> 00:49:18.250
Robin. Robin!

658
00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:20.710
Who's that?

659
00:49:22.004 --> 00:49:23.130
Someone from band.

660
00:49:28.677 --> 00:49:29.677
How much is this?

661
00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:32.848
$120.99. but I'll throw in
20 rounds of buckshot for ya.

662
00:49:34.308 --> 00:49:37.811
Hey. can I see this
real pretty .357. please?

663
00:49:37.895 --> 00:49:40.397
Sure thing.

664
00:49:41.607 --> 00:49:43.734
- Here you go. son.
- Thank you.

665
00:49:47.696 --> 00:49:48.822
Nancy Wheeler.

666
00:49:53.076 --> 00:49:54.578
Wouldn't expect to find you here.

667
00:49:54.661 --> 00:49:59.082
Yeah. well. it's just... scary times.

668
00:50:04.212 --> 00:50:08.800
I'm... sorry about Chrissy.

669
00:50:13.847 --> 00:50:14.973
Want my advice?

670
00:50:16.308 --> 00:50:19.686
Shotguns are not good for much of
anything past killing small birds.

671
00:50:22.105 --> 00:50:23.899
I mean. they got power. sure.

672
00:50:24.399 --> 00:50:25.484
but not much range.

673
00:50:26.485 --> 00:50:29.655
And that's just gonna force
you into close-range combat.

674
00:50:29.738 --> 00:50:31.698
then someone can just grab
that barrel like this...

675
00:50:33.283 --> 00:50:34.409
... and redirect it.

676
00:50:46.338 --> 00:50:47.756
Well. you look nervous.

677
00:50:49.299 --> 00:50:50.299
Like I said.

678
00:50:52.052 --> 00:50:53.220
scary times.

679
00:50:56.765 --> 00:50:58.100
Now. your brother. he. uh...

680
00:51:00.185 --> 00:51:01.812
is he here with you. by chance?

681
00:51:02.396 --> 00:51:03.396
Mike?

682
00:51:03.897 --> 00:51:05.065
Mike.

683
00:51:05.732 --> 00:51:06.732
No.

684
00:51:07.401 --> 00:51:09.194
I only ask because he's...

685
00:51:11.321 --> 00:51:12.990
he's in Hellfire. isn't he?

686
00:51:14.324 --> 00:51:16.868
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- What about his friends?

687
00:51:17.995 --> 00:51:19.037
They here with you?

688
00:51:19.538 --> 00:51:20.998
Would you let go?

689
00:51:22.624 --> 00:51:24.960
Let go.

690
00:51:30.799 --> 00:51:32.509
What the hell is taking so long?

691
00:51:33.927 --> 00:51:35.220
- What happened?
- Gotta go.

692
00:51:35.303 --> 00:51:37.347
- Your old friends are here.
- Shit!

693
00:51:37.848 --> 00:51:40.809
- Let's go! Let's go!
- I'm going! I'm going! Sit down!

694
00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:01.705
Should be up on our right.

695
00:52:01.788 --> 00:52:03.331
There's nothing out here.

696
00:52:05.667 --> 00:52:07.419
Mmm. We there already?

697
00:52:07.502 --> 00:52:11.381
- Already? It's been nine hours.
- It's gotta be around here somewhere.

698
00:52:11.465 --> 00:52:13.216
What are we looking for. my dudes?

699
00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:16.094
- Some sort of facility.
- A fence. A building.

700
00:52:16.178 --> 00:52:17.804
Any signs of life would be nice.

701
00:52:17.888 --> 00:52:21.683
Since when did we decide Nina was
a building and not a small woman?

702
00:52:22.726 --> 00:52:24.269
Sounds like a small woman to me.

703
00:52:24.352 --> 00:52:25.729
It's not a small woman.

704
00:52:25.812 --> 00:52:28.106
Small woman out in this
desert would be hard to see.

705
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:31.568
- How is he still high?
- Sure you got your measurements right?

706
00:52:31.651 --> 00:52:32.651
Yes. they're right.

707
00:52:32.694 --> 00:52:34.154
- You're 100%. right?
- Yes.

708
00:52:34.237 --> 00:52:36.323
Maybe latitude and longitude are wrong.

709
00:52:36.406 --> 00:52:39.576
- Are you really questioning Suzie?
- She's a genius. Jonathan.

710
00:52:39.659 --> 00:52:41.703
- Even geniuses make mistakes.
- Well. she didn't.

711
00:52:41.787 --> 00:52:45.207
If that small woman is small enough.
she could fit behind a small tree.

712
00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:46.333
Stop! Just...

713
00:52:49.836 --> 00:52:51.296
- Ouch.
- What are you doing?

714
00:52:51.379 --> 00:52:53.715
I am stopping us
before we get more lost.

715
00:52:55.801 --> 00:52:58.261
- Give me the coordinates.
- Um. okay.

716
00:52:58.345 --> 00:53:01.723
Longitude is 116 degrees.
five minutes. and 17...

717
00:53:01.807 --> 00:53:02.974
Slow down. Slow down.

718
00:53:05.352 --> 00:53:06.352
Nina!

719
00:53:09.439 --> 00:53:10.524
Nina.

720
00:53:12.317 --> 00:53:13.317
Nina?

721
00:53:15.445 --> 00:53:16.696
Nina!

722
00:53:24.412 --> 00:53:26.623
Holy macaroni.

723
00:53:26.706 --> 00:53:30.418
All right. You just go straight
down. Like. straight... straight...

724
00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:35.382
Right on the money. as I said.

725
00:53:35.465 --> 00:53:37.509
- It just doesn't make sense.
- Yo. dudes!

726
00:53:39.052 --> 00:53:40.637
My dudes!

727
00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:41.763
Jesus Christ.

728
00:53:41.847 --> 00:53:43.557
Come check this shit out!

729
00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:44.975
What is it?

730
00:53:45.058 --> 00:53:47.102
Gotta see it to believe it. my dudes!

731
00:53:48.353 --> 00:53:49.521
Come on! Hurry!

732
00:53:49.604 --> 00:53:52.315
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Pronto!

733
00:53:54.317 --> 00:53:55.360
Okay.

734
00:53:55.443 --> 00:53:57.320
So no small woman named Nina.

735
00:53:57.404 --> 00:54:00.240
But you said any signs
of life. am I right?

736
00:54:00.323 --> 00:54:02.241
- Right.
- Well.

737
00:54:03.702 --> 00:54:08.165
these are no regular
tire tracks. brochachos.

738
00:54:08.248 --> 00:54:10.500
I mean. look at the
tread on these monsters.

739
00:54:11.209 --> 00:54:13.920
They're fatties. And
you know what that means.

740
00:54:14.004 --> 00:54:15.004
Military.

741
00:54:15.422 --> 00:54:16.506
We gotta go.

742
00:54:57.005 --> 00:54:59.216
Well. I wouldn't do it if I
didn't think she was ready.

743
00:54:59.299 --> 00:55:02.052
But either way. I don't think
we have any other choice.

744
00:55:02.135 --> 00:55:03.470
- Do you?
- No. I don't.

745
00:55:03.553 --> 00:55:04.554
Yeah.

746
00:55:04.638 --> 00:55:07.265
- It might take me some time though.
- Just... As fast as you can.

747
00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:10.310
It's gonna take us two hours
to get to Nellis as it is.

748
00:55:10.393 --> 00:55:11.770
And. Ellen. one more favor.

749
00:55:11.853 --> 00:55:15.106
Can you send somebody over
to a Max Mayfield's house?

750
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:18.193
There are some kids there that
just need looking after. okay?

751
00:55:18.276 --> 00:55:21.196
Ellen? Hello?

752
00:55:21.279 --> 00:55:22.739
Sam? Hello?

753
00:55:28.328 --> 00:55:29.871
Why the long face. Doc?

754
00:55:30.622 --> 00:55:31.831
We just wanna talk.

755
00:56:12.539 --> 00:56:13.539
No! Wait!

756
00:56:14.082 --> 00:56:15.083
No! No!

757
00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:19.920
What...

758
00:56:25.218 --> 00:56:26.928
You can't leave. Eleven.

759
00:56:33.226 --> 00:56:34.561
Where is Dr. Owens?

760
00:56:34.644 --> 00:56:36.646
Dr. Owens had a change of heart.

761
00:56:40.066 --> 00:56:41.568
I know you wish to go to him.

762
00:56:41.651 --> 00:56:44.279
and there's nothing I can do to stop you

763
00:56:44.362 --> 00:56:45.780
from forcing open that door.

764
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:48.825
But if my men hear you coming.

765
00:56:49.701 --> 00:56:50.701
they will kill him.

766
00:56:54.414 --> 00:56:56.001
And alone. you will never find your way

767
00:56:56.002 --> 00:56:57.625
out of this desert to your friends.

768
00:56:58.835 --> 00:57:00.503
Here's what we're going to do.

769
00:57:01.421 --> 00:57:04.883
You and I are going to
complete our work together.

770
00:57:06.134 --> 00:57:08.470
And when I decide that you are ready.

771
00:57:08.553 --> 00:57:11.514
we will return to Hawkins. together.

772
00:57:12.098 --> 00:57:13.767
Papa and daughter.

773
00:57:15.643 --> 00:57:18.396
Why are you doing this?

774
00:57:19.147 --> 00:57:20.648
Because there's no other choice.

775
00:57:20.732 --> 00:57:21.941
There is a choice.

776
00:57:23.401 --> 00:57:24.819
Only one that is right.

777
00:57:26.363 --> 00:57:27.947
And you make the right choices?

778
00:57:28.656 --> 00:57:29.699
I try.

779
00:57:29.783 --> 00:57:32.118
Did you make the right choice with Mama?

780
00:57:32.202 --> 00:57:33.453
Four-fifty.

781
00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:38.875
Your mother was sick. Eleven.

782
00:57:39.542 --> 00:57:41.378
She was a danger to
herself and to others.

783
00:57:41.461 --> 00:57:44.214
She brought a gun into the
hospital. She killed a man.

784
00:57:44.297 --> 00:57:45.757
Hospital?

785
00:57:46.758 --> 00:57:47.758
No.

786
00:57:49.135 --> 00:57:50.220
A prison.

787
00:57:50.970 --> 00:57:53.890
Everything I have done
was for your own good.

788
00:57:53.973 --> 00:57:55.308
For your own protection.

789
00:57:56.059 --> 00:57:57.059
And Henry?

790
00:57:58.478 --> 00:58:01.064
You kept Henry in that lab.

791
00:58:01.147 --> 00:58:02.565
With the children.

792
00:58:02.649 --> 00:58:03.983
Was that for our good?

793
00:58:04.067 --> 00:58:05.777
Was that a right choice?

794
00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:08.405
I had no idea what Henry would do.

795
00:58:09.155 --> 00:58:10.407
I cared for you.

796
00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:12.617
I loved you. I loved all of you.

797
00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:13.701
Even Henry?

798
00:58:14.244 --> 00:58:15.244
Yes.

799
00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:19.124
I was trying to help Henry.
to understand him. Yes.

800
00:58:19.666 --> 00:58:21.418
Yes. I cared for him.

801
00:58:21.501 --> 00:58:25.046
Even after what... what he did?

802
00:58:25.713 --> 00:58:26.840
Yes.

803
00:58:26.923 --> 00:58:29.926
Because I knew I had failed him.

804
00:58:31.261 --> 00:58:32.512
So this morning.

805
00:58:33.263 --> 00:58:36.641
you said you believed he was
always alive in the darkness.

806
00:58:37.809 --> 00:58:40.311
Is that why I was
searching the darkness?

807
00:58:45.108 --> 00:58:47.110
Was I looking for him? For Henry?

808
00:58:47.944 --> 00:58:49.779
No. No.

809
00:58:50.530 --> 00:58:52.699
We were focused on the Soviets.

810
00:58:52.782 --> 00:58:53.782
You knew that.

811
00:58:53.783 --> 00:58:55.869
"Papa does not tell the truth."

812
00:58:56.703 --> 00:58:57.954
Henry said that.

813
00:58:58.705 --> 00:59:00.707
And now you trust Henry?

814
00:59:02.041 --> 00:59:04.919
Henry. who's manipulated
you like some puppet?

815
00:59:06.713 --> 00:59:10.216
You are the one who
released him from his prison.

816
00:59:12.093 --> 00:59:13.093
You.

817
00:59:14.345 --> 00:59:16.264
And now you are angry with yourself

818
00:59:16.347 --> 00:59:18.349
and you're taking your anger out on me

819
00:59:18.433 --> 00:59:19.934
and you're risking everything.

820
00:59:20.018 --> 00:59:21.018
No.

821
00:59:21.394 --> 00:59:22.520
No. you.

822
00:59:24.147 --> 00:59:25.857
You have risked everything!

823
00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:26.983
You have lied!

824
00:59:27.066 --> 00:59:28.485
You made me look for him!

825
00:59:34.032 --> 00:59:35.241
The gate.

826
00:59:37.494 --> 00:59:38.620
The Mind Flayer.

827
00:59:41.873 --> 00:59:42.957
So many dead.

828
00:59:45.835 --> 00:59:47.045
And all because of you.

829
00:59:47.128 --> 00:59:48.796
Because you could not stop.

830
00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:50.507
You could not let him go.

831
00:59:52.383 --> 00:59:55.803
I came here to try and
understand who I was.

832
00:59:58.306 --> 00:59:59.307
To see if I...

833
01:00:00.683 --> 01:00:02.101
if I was the monster.

834
01:00:06.064 --> 01:00:07.064
Papa!

835
01:00:08.316 --> 01:00:09.901
And now I know the truth.

836
01:00:12.153 --> 01:00:13.279
It is not me.

837
01:00:15.114 --> 01:00:16.199
It is you.

838
01:00:17.825 --> 01:00:18.826
You

839
01:00:19.994 --> 01:00:21.371
are the monster.

840
01:00:24.415 --> 01:00:26.417
I am going to open that door.

841
01:00:27.001 --> 01:00:28.503
and I am going to leave

842
01:00:29.587 --> 01:00:31.422
with Dr. Owens.

843
01:00:33.258 --> 01:00:35.593
If you try to stop me. I will kill you.

844
01:01:12.463 --> 01:01:14.257
You'll soon see the truth. Eleven.

845
01:01:25.727 --> 01:01:26.894
Ah!

846
01:01:53.713 --> 01:01:54.713
Is this legal?

847
01:01:56.215 --> 01:01:58.593
Actually. I think it's a felony.

848
01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:00.510
Right.

849
01:02:01.012 --> 01:02:02.764
But it guarantees one thing.

850
01:02:04.682 --> 01:02:06.059
I won't miss.

851
01:02:08.936 --> 01:02:11.773
- How's she feeling?
- Light. But durable.

852
01:02:13.066 --> 01:02:14.066
Deadly.

853
01:02:15.193 --> 01:02:16.861
But reliable.

854
01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:20.114
Hear me now.

855
01:02:20.907 --> 01:02:23.743
There will be no more retreating...

856
01:02:24.577 --> 01:02:27.163
from Eddie the Banished.

857
01:02:27.246 --> 01:02:29.499
Hey. you're really ready for bat-tle.

858
01:02:33.336 --> 01:02:34.336
You get it?

859
01:02:35.713 --> 01:02:36.713
"Bat-tle."

860
01:02:37.298 --> 01:02:38.298
B-A-T.

861
01:02:39.884 --> 01:02:41.386
No?

862
01:02:41.469 --> 01:02:42.679
I thought I had a good one.

863
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:45.430
What are you doing?

864
01:02:46.349 --> 01:02:47.725
You son of a bitch!

865
01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.021
No wedgies! No wedgies!

866
01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:53.730
Never change.

867
01:02:54.565 --> 01:02:55.692
Dustin Henderson.

868
01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:58.860
Promise me?

869
01:03:00.863 --> 01:03:02.156
I wasn't planning on it.

870
01:03:04.033 --> 01:03:05.033
Good.

871
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:07.328
- Good.
- Good.

872
01:03:07.412 --> 01:03:08.871
Hey. Sinclairs.

873
01:03:09.497 --> 01:03:12.125
How are those. uh...
those spears coming on?

874
01:03:14.168 --> 01:03:15.670
Flip that damn thumb around.

875
01:03:16.754 --> 01:03:17.754
What?

876
01:03:19.257 --> 01:03:21.217
It's too loose. Lucas.

877
01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:22.719
This isn't a basketball game

878
01:03:22.802 --> 01:03:25.430
where they blow the whistle
when your shoes fall off.

879
01:03:26.222 --> 01:03:28.015
Okay. okay. for the record.

880
01:03:28.099 --> 01:03:29.642
my shoes never fell off.

881
01:03:29.726 --> 01:03:31.185
Okay. for the record.

882
01:03:31.269 --> 01:03:33.004
it's kinda hard for
your shoes to fall off

883
01:03:33.005 --> 01:03:34.272
when you're riding the bench.

884
01:03:34.355 --> 01:03:36.232
Yet. for some reason.

885
01:03:36.315 --> 01:03:37.859
you show up to every game.

886
01:03:37.942 --> 01:03:39.861
Mmm. except the one that mattered.

887
01:03:39.944 --> 01:03:41.612
Plus. Mom and Dad forced me.

888
01:03:41.696 --> 01:03:44.574
Bull. Mom and Dad can't
force you to do shit.

889
01:03:44.657 --> 01:03:47.368
Well. even though you're
a bench-riding loser.

890
01:03:47.452 --> 01:03:48.786
you're still my brother.

891
01:03:49.287 --> 01:03:50.287
Just the facts.

892
01:03:53.624 --> 01:03:56.043
- It just doesn't make sense.
- What doesn't make sense?

893
01:03:56.127 --> 01:03:59.589
That was Dan Shelter. He
graduated. like. two years ago.

894
01:03:59.672 --> 01:04:01.716
- So?
- So he's in college.

895
01:04:01.799 --> 01:04:03.801
Which means he was
visiting on spring break.

896
01:04:03.885 --> 01:04:07.138
Fast Times was returned.
like. I don't know. a week ago?

897
01:04:07.221 --> 01:04:10.016
Right? Unless she's got some
horndog brother we don't know about.

898
01:04:10.099 --> 01:04:11.851
Which is possible.

899
01:04:11.934 --> 01:04:14.270
Or she's just really
into Judge Reinhold?

900
01:04:14.313 --> 01:04:15.313
- Steve.
- Nah.

901
01:04:15.313 --> 01:04:17.190
- What?
- I don't care.

902
01:04:17.273 --> 01:04:19.901
I don't understand why you do either
with everything that's going on.

903
01:04:19.984 --> 01:04:22.308
Honestly. this feels like a perfect time

904
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:23.821
for that little pull
of the rug because...

905
01:04:24.864 --> 01:04:27.325
in the face of the world ending.
the stakes of my love life

906
01:04:27.408 --> 01:04:29.118
feel spectacularly low.

907
01:04:30.036 --> 01:04:32.663
Yeah. I mean. I get you there.

908
01:04:32.747 --> 01:04:35.333
but... I still have hope.

909
01:04:37.627 --> 01:04:41.214
- Not everything has a happy ending.
- Yeah. yeah. believe me. I know.

910
01:04:46.636 --> 01:04:49.013
I'm not talking about failed romance.

911
01:04:49.972 --> 01:04:50.972
I just...

912
01:04:51.724 --> 01:04:53.142
I have this terrible.

913
01:04:54.685 --> 01:04:56.229
gnawing feeling that...

914
01:04:58.981 --> 01:05:00.983
it might not work out for us this time.

915
01:05:02.193 --> 01:05:04.111
You think we shouldn't be doing this?

916
01:05:04.654 --> 01:05:08.241
I think we're mad fools.
the lot of us. but...

917
01:05:09.992 --> 01:05:12.745
... but if we don't stop him. who will?

918
01:05:18.668 --> 01:05:20.294
We have to try. right?

919
01:05:23.965 --> 01:05:25.049
Yeah.

920
01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:30.304
To killing Vecna.

921
01:05:33.891 --> 01:05:35.017
Slash Henry.

922
01:05:36.310 --> 01:05:38.312
Slash One.

923
01:05:55.371 --> 01:05:57.456
It's only a precaution. Eleven.

924
01:05:59.625 --> 01:06:01.460
I never intend to activate it.

925
01:06:04.922 --> 01:06:06.215
I very much hope

926
01:06:06.924 --> 01:06:08.926
our fighting has come to an end.

927
01:06:16.375 --> 01:06:17.435
Shh.

928
01:06:17.435 --> 01:06:19.437
Shh.

929
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:22.315
I know.

930
01:06:22.398 --> 01:06:23.816
You're angry with me.

931
01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:27.361
But it was the only way.

932
01:06:30.781 --> 01:06:31.991
The best way.

933
01:06:41.709 --> 01:06:43.836
- What's going on?
- It's Sullivan.

934
01:06:44.545 --> 01:06:45.630
They found us.

935
01:06:55.556 --> 01:06:56.724
Go. go. go!

936
01:07:22.166 --> 01:07:24.877
Three! Two! One!

937
01:07:33.844 --> 01:07:35.930
- Go to the back!
- Get moving!

938
01:07:36.013 --> 01:07:37.098
- Move out!
- Go!

939
01:07:37.181 --> 01:07:38.808
- Get 'em out of here!
- No more time!

940
01:07:38.891 --> 01:07:39.934
Evacuate now!

941
01:08:01.288 --> 01:08:02.415
Move!

942
01:08:02.498 --> 01:08:04.208
Steady! Fire!

943
01:08:18.514 --> 01:08:19.849
Eleven. we have to go.

944
01:08:20.391 --> 01:08:22.852
- What is happening?
- They've come to kill you.

945
01:08:31.068 --> 01:08:33.487
Evacuate immediately. Please proceed...

946
01:08:43.247 --> 01:08:45.166
- Clear.
- Clear!

947
01:08:46.584 --> 01:08:49.336
Quarter and search by twos.
Hicks. take the upper level.

948
01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:50.420
Yes. sir.

949
01:09:09.356 --> 01:09:10.356
Sir?

950
01:09:11.484 --> 01:09:13.277
We found something
you're gonna wanna see.

951
01:09:18.115 --> 01:09:19.325
Well. well.

952
01:09:20.868 --> 01:09:22.078
And what happened here?

953
01:09:22.578 --> 01:09:23.578
Hmm?

954
01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:26.540
Are Mommy and Daddy fighting?

955
01:09:27.958 --> 01:09:28.958
Okay.

956
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:34.340
Let's try this again. shall we?

957
01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:38.886
Where's the girl?

958
01:10:08.165 --> 01:10:09.792
Where do you think you're going. Doc?

959
01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:20.094
- Why don't you give 'em some lead?
- I got it.

960
01:10:35.943 --> 01:10:37.403
Down he goes.

961
01:11:02.178 --> 01:11:04.388
Victor-Two-Sierra. this
is Charlie-Lima-Golf.

962
01:11:04.471 --> 01:11:05.806
Do you copy. over?

963
01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:08.809
Victor-Two-Sierra. I copy. over.

964
01:11:08.893 --> 01:11:10.603
We've got the target in our sights.

965
01:11:10.686 --> 01:11:12.897
Requesting permission
to take the shot. over.

966
01:11:14.231 --> 01:11:16.025
Jack. you don't have to do this.

967
01:11:16.108 --> 01:11:17.109
It's over. Sam.

968
01:11:17.193 --> 01:11:19.778
Wait! Wait! Wait! I
can put her in a coma.

969
01:11:20.487 --> 01:11:22.156
A medically induced coma.

970
01:11:22.239 --> 01:11:24.366
We have the drugs. We
can do it right here.

971
01:11:24.450 --> 01:11:27.536
And we'll see if... if
these murders keep happening.

972
01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:30.664
If you're right. the killing ends.
and you can pull the plug on her.

973
01:11:30.748 --> 01:11:32.082
In fact. I'll do it myself.

974
01:11:32.166 --> 01:11:34.001
But if you're wrong about this.

975
01:11:34.793 --> 01:11:36.212
God. are we gonna need her.

976
01:11:36.795 --> 01:11:37.795
Jack.

977
01:11:38.923 --> 01:11:39.924
Don't do this.

978
01:11:40.507 --> 01:11:41.675
I'm begging you.

979
01:11:48.916 --> 01:11:49.934
Take it.

980
01:11:49.934 --> 01:11:51.185
You son of a bitch!

981
01:11:51.268 --> 01:11:53.437
No! You son of a bitch!

982
01:11:54.104 --> 01:11:55.564
Green light. Light her up.

983
01:12:00.444 --> 01:12:01.862
Civvies. Five o'clock.

984
01:12:04.949 --> 01:12:05.949
The hell?

985
01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:07.952
- There she is! There she is!
- Where?

986
01:12:08.035 --> 01:12:10.955
- On the ground!
- What are those dudes doing on the ground?

987
01:12:11.038 --> 01:12:12.498
- Is that blood. man?
- Shit.

988
01:12:14.291 --> 01:12:17.461
Victor-Two-Sierra. we've
got a civvy headed our way.

989
01:12:17.544 --> 01:12:20.089
Ignore it. Just take out the girl.

990
01:12:20.172 --> 01:12:22.466
Copy that. Ignore the
civvy. Take the shot.

991
01:12:30.099 --> 01:12:31.099
Found ya.

992
01:12:37.439 --> 01:12:40.651
- Hell are you doing? Hold her steady!
- I don't know. man. Something's wrong!

993
01:12:45.239 --> 01:12:46.239
Jesus Christ.

994
01:12:56.125 --> 01:12:57.125
Holy shit!

995
01:12:57.126 --> 01:12:58.377
Shit!

996
01:13:08.304 --> 01:13:09.304
I'm losing her!

997
01:13:13.934 --> 01:13:14.934
Shit!

998
01:13:21.608 --> 01:13:25.029
- Shit!
- Shit! I can't! I can't hold it!

999
01:13:42.588 --> 01:13:44.256
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1000
01:14:33.806 --> 01:14:34.973
Eleven!

1001
01:14:37.434 --> 01:14:38.477
Eleven.

1002
01:14:42.439 --> 01:14:43.482
Oh. Mike.

1003
01:14:51.532 --> 01:14:52.783
It's really you?

1004
01:14:53.492 --> 01:14:54.492
It's me.

1005
01:14:56.703 --> 01:14:57.746
- I'm here.
- Okay.

1006
01:14:58.497 --> 01:14:59.581
Everyone's here.

01:15:23.021 --> 01:15:24.106
You... Are you okay?

1012
01:15:25.274 --> 01:15:26.733
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

1013
01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:30.237
Hey. guys. We gotta go.

1014
01:15:31.447 --> 01:15:32.698
We gotta get you outta here.

1015
01:16:22.164 --> 01:16:23.165
Papa.

1016
01:16:24.708 --> 01:16:25.708
Eleven.

1017
01:16:31.924 --> 01:16:33.175
I want you to know

1018
01:16:34.259 --> 01:16:35.259
I'm proud of you.

1019
01:16:36.678 --> 01:16:37.888
So very proud.

1020
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:41.433
You

01:16:43.143 --> 01:16:44.353

1022
01:16:48.982 --> 01:16:50.150
My child.

1023
01:17:02.454 --> 01:17:03.747
I've only ever

1024
01:17:04.623 --> 01:17:05.832
wanted to help you.

1025
01:17:07.709 --> 01:17:08.835
To protect you.

1026

Everything I did.

1027
01:17:15.968 --> 01:17:17.052
I did for you.

1028
01:17:19.846 --> 01:17:21.682
I need you to understand.

1029
01:17:23.976 --> 01:17:25.894
Please tell me you understand.

1030
01:17:41.535 --> 01:17:42.536
Please.

1031
01:18:17.362 --> 01:18:18.572
Goodbye. Papa.

1032

- We need to get to Hawkins.
- I know. And we will.

1033
01:19:48.912 --> 01:19:51.415
But we need to get you somewhere
safe. Gonna be people behind us.

1034
01:19:51.498 --> 01:19:53.333
No. Mike. we need to
get to Hawkins tonight.

1035
01:19:53.417 --> 01:19:55.627
We'll never make it.
That's over 2.000 miles.

1036
01:19:55.711 --> 01:19:56.920
We need to find a way.

1037
01:19:57.003 --> 01:19:59.131
If we don't. they are going to die.

1038
01:19:59.798 --> 01:20:00.882
