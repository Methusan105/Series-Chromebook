<i>Unknown are the names
of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

2
00:00:21.356 --> 00:00:26.611
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth
and long for the wind</i>

3
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.700
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

4
00:00:31.908 --> 00:00:37.038
<i>Only the will to fight
can change the here and now!</i>

5
00:00:37.247 --> 00:00:42.335
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve
to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

6
00:00:42.544 --> 00:00:44.879
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

7
00:00:45.088 --> 00:00:47.757
<i>Give us the freedom of dying.
starving wolves!</i>

8
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:53.138
<i>The humiliation of being caged
is what triggers us to fight back</i>

9
00:00:53.346 --> 00:00:58.435
<i>We hunters slaughter prey
beyond the castle walls.</i>

10
00:00:58.643 --> 00:01:03.648
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust.</i>

11
00:01:03.857 --> 00:01:10.780
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows
pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

12
00:01:39.851 --> 00:01:40.810
Hey. you!

13
00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:41.895
Sir!

14
00:01:42.103 --> 00:01:43.521
Who the hell are you?!

15
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.691
Armin Arlelt. from Shiganshina District!

16
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.944
I see! That's a ridiculous name!
Did your parents give it to you?!

17
00:01:50.153 --> 00:01:51.863
My grandfather did. Sir!

18
00:01:52.071 --> 00:01:54.699
Arlelt! Why are you here?!

19
00:01:54.908 --> 00:01:56.743
To help humanity achieve victory!

20
00:01:56.951 --> 00:02:00.914
That's wonderful to hear!
We can feed you to the Titans!

21
00:02:01.122 --> 00:02:03.041
Third row. about face!

22
00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:05.543
Who the hell are you?!

23
00:02:05.752 --> 00:02:08.505
Sir! Thomas Wagner. from Trost District!

24
00:02:08.713 --> 00:02:09.839
I can't hear you!

25
00:02:10.048 --> 00:02:11.424
- Thomas Wagner...
- Can't hear you!

26
00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:13.426
- Look at them go.
- Go practice in a barn!

27
00:02:13.635 --> 00:02:16.513
You went through the same thing
when you started as a cadet. didn't you?

28
00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:17.972
It takes me back.

29
00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:21.226
No! You're from a pigsty!
You're less than livestock!

30
00:02:21.434 --> 00:02:23.436
Yes. Sir! I am less than livestock!

31
00:02:23.645 --> 00:02:25.480
- No!
- But what's all that intimidation for?

32
00:02:25.688 --> 00:02:27.106
It's a rite of passage.

33
00:02:27.315 --> 00:02:29.400
We revert them to a blank slate
through the use of self-denial.

34
00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:33.112
after which we mold them into proper soldiers.

35
00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:35.990
- Change it at once! Why are you here?!
- This is one step in that process.

36
00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.284
To devote myself to humankind!

37
00:02:38.493 --> 00:02:40.453
Fourth row. about face!

38
00:02:41.704 --> 00:02:44.666
There are some he's not talking to...

39
00:02:44.874 --> 00:02:48.628
It's unnecessary for those who've
already been through their rites of passage.

40
00:02:48.837 --> 00:02:52.715
They most likely witnessed the hell
that took place two years ago.

41
00:02:52.924 --> 00:02:54.968
They have a different look on their faces.

42
00:02:55.176 --> 00:02:57.512
Okay. Let's go.

43
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.888
Who the hell are you?!

44
00:02:59.097 --> 00:03:01.182
Jean Kirschtein. from Trost District!

45
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:03.935
Why are you here?!

46
00:03:04.143 --> 00:03:07.355
To join the Military Police Regiment
and live in the interior!

47
00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:12.402
Oh. You wanna live in the interior. do you?

48
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.112
Yes!

49
00:03:15.321 --> 00:03:17.115
Who said you could sit?!

50
00:03:17.323 --> 00:03:22.120
If you can't handle this.
you can forget about the Military Police!

51
00:03:22.328 --> 00:03:24.706
Who the hell are you?! Why are you here?!

52
00:03:24.914 --> 00:03:28.042
Marco Bodt of Jinae. on the south side of Wall Rose!

53
00:03:28.251 --> 00:03:32.297
I want to join the Military Police Regiment
and give life and limb to the king!

54
00:03:32.505 --> 00:03:34.090
I see.

55
00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.969
That's a fine goal. indeed. Go ahead and strive for it.

56
00:03:38.177 --> 00:03:40.847
But. just so you know...

57
00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:44.809
The king doesn't <i>want</i> your lousy life or limbs.

58
00:03:46.227 --> 00:03:49.314
You're next! Who the hell are you?!

59
00:03:49.522 --> 00:03:50.398
Conny Springer!

60
00:03:50.607 --> 00:03:53.693
I'm from Ragako Village
on the south side of Wall Rose!

61
00:03:53.902 --> 00:03:56.613
You have it backwards. Conny Springer!

62
00:03:56.821 --> 00:03:58.615
It was the first thing you were taught!

63
00:03:58.823 --> 00:04:03.703
This salute expresses your resolve
to give your heart to the people!

64
00:04:03.912 --> 00:04:07.999
Is your heart on your right side?!

65
00:04:16.716 --> 00:04:18.301
Hey. you.

66
00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.428
What do you think you're doing?

67
00:04:24.474 --> 00:04:28.144
I'm talking to <i>you</i>! Who the hell are you?!

68
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.943
Sasha Braus from Dauper Village.
on the south side of Wall Rose!

69
00:04:35.151 --> 00:04:37.111
Sasha Braus...

70
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.281
What is that you're holding in your right hand?

71
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.991
A steamed potato. Sir!

72
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.703
I found one in the cookhouse
that was ready to eat. so I couldn't help myself!

73
00:04:45.912 --> 00:04:48.081
You stole it?

74
00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:49.499
Why?

75
00:04:49.707 --> 00:04:52.168
Why did you decide to eat it now?

76
00:04:52.377 --> 00:04:55.380
I felt it would be a waste to let it get cold.

77
00:04:55.588 --> 00:04:58.424
so I elected to eat it now.

78
00:04:58.633 --> 00:05:01.386
No. I don't understand.

79
00:05:01.594 --> 00:05:04.347
Why did you eat the potato?

80
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.728
Are you asking me why people eat potatoes. Sir?

81
00:05:24.492 --> 00:05:27.912
Here's half of it for you.

82
00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:30.957
Half...?

83
00:05:34.794 --> 00:05:38.381
Whoa. He <i>still</i> has Potato Girl running.

84
00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:41.634
Man. she's been at it for five solid hours.
She's really something.

85
00:05:41.843 --> 00:05:45.221
Still. being told to run
until she's on the verge of death

86
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.767
didn't seem to bother her quite as much
as being told she has to skip meals.

87
00:05:49.976 --> 00:05:56.024
Dauper's a small hunting village
in the mountains. isn't it?

88
00:05:56.232 --> 00:05:57.316
What's that?

89
00:05:57.525 --> 00:06:01.404
They're dropouts. They asked
to work in the fields instead.

90
00:06:01.612 --> 00:06:04.532
Whoa. It's only the first day. too...

91
00:06:04.741 --> 00:06:08.453
That's just how it is. If you
can't cut it here. you have to leave.

92
00:06:10.455 --> 00:06:14.751
I can't believe anyone would want
to pick up rocks and pull plants again...

93
00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:18.671
Come to think of it. we haven't heard
anything about where you're from.

94
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.008
I'm from Shiganshina. same as him.

95
00:06:22.216 --> 00:06:24.302
Oh. That means...

96
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.304
You were there that day. weren't you?

97
00:06:26.512 --> 00:06:27.513
H-Hey!

98
00:06:27.722 --> 00:06:30.308
Did you see the Colossal Titan?!

99
00:06:30.516 --> 00:06:32.602
Y-Yeah...

100
00:06:35.438 --> 00:06:38.858
<i>Yes</i>. I saw it.

101
00:06:39.067 --> 00:06:40.068
Really?!

102
00:06:40.276 --> 00:06:41.986
How big is it?!

103
00:06:42.195 --> 00:06:44.030
Enough to look over the wall.

104
00:06:44.238 --> 00:06:46.949
What?! I heard it stepped <i>over</i> the wall!

105
00:06:47.158 --> 00:06:47.950
Me too!

106
00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:49.786
That's what they said in my village too!

107
00:06:49.994 --> 00:06:52.663
No. it wasn't that big.

108
00:06:52.872 --> 00:06:54.707
What did it look like?!

109
00:06:54.916 --> 00:06:58.711
It had a huge mouth. and almost no skin.

110
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.672
What about the Armored Titan
that broke Wall Maria?!

111
00:07:01.881 --> 00:07:06.219
That's what people call it. but it
looked like an ordinary Titan to me.

112
00:07:06.427 --> 00:07:09.222
Th-Then. what are ordinary Titans like?!

113
00:07:17.772 --> 00:07:20.691
Let's spare him the questions. everyone.

114
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.027
I'm sure there are things
he doesn't want to remember.

115
00:07:23.236 --> 00:07:24.195
Sorry for asking...

116
00:07:24.403 --> 00:07:26.280
It's not like that!

117
00:07:30.034 --> 00:07:33.246
Titans aren't actually that big of a deal!

118
00:07:33.454 --> 00:07:37.500
Once we've mastered omni-directional mobility gear.

119
00:07:37.708 --> 00:07:39.544
they'll be nothing to us!

120
00:07:39.752 --> 00:07:42.547
We <i>finally</i> get to train as soldiers.

121
00:07:42.755 --> 00:07:45.508
I was just overcome with emotion. that's all.

122
00:07:45.716 --> 00:07:49.762
I'm going to join the Scout Regiment
and drive the Titans out of this world!

123
00:07:49.971 --> 00:07:51.222
I'm gonna slaughter them!

124
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.766
Whoa. what are you. crazy?

125
00:07:53.975 --> 00:07:57.770
Did you just say you're gonna join
the Scout Regiment?

126
00:07:57.979 --> 00:08:00.106
Yeah. that's right.

127
00:08:00.314 --> 00:08:02.775
Aren't you the one
who wants to join the Military Police

128
00:08:02.984 --> 00:08:04.694
and live the easy life?

129
00:08:04.902 --> 00:08:07.113
I'm all about being honest. you see.

130
00:08:07.321 --> 00:08:10.741
It's much nicer than being.
say. a loser who acts tough

131
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.411
but is actually scared shitless.

132
00:08:14.579 --> 00:08:15.872
Are you talking about me?!

133
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.832
S-Stop...!

134
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.167
Come on. now.

135
00:08:19.375 --> 00:08:21.085
It makes no difference to me.

136
00:08:30.678 --> 00:08:32.680
Look. I'm sorry.

137
00:08:32.889 --> 00:08:36.142
I don't mean to dismiss your ideas.

138
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.269
Let's be friends.

139
00:08:39.645 --> 00:08:42.064
Yeah. I'm sorry. too.

140
00:08:56.829 --> 00:08:58.664
H-Hey. you!

141
00:08:59.749 --> 00:09:03.669
Uhh. err. umm...

142
00:09:03.878 --> 00:09:07.089
I've just never seen anyone
who looks like you before...

143
00:09:07.298 --> 00:09:09.383
S-Sorry!

144
00:09:09.592 --> 00:09:12.053
You have very pretty black hair.

145
00:09:12.261 --> 00:09:13.721
Thanks.

146
00:09:22.688 --> 00:09:24.732
It's no big deal. Get off my back.

147
00:09:24.941 --> 00:09:27.693
You never think things through
when you get worked up.

148
00:09:27.902 --> 00:09:29.612
That again?

149
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.491
Anyway. don't you think your hair's too long?

150
00:09:33.699 --> 00:09:37.119
It could cause an accident
during ODM training. you know.

151
00:09:37.328 --> 00:09:40.081
All right. I'll cut it.

152
00:09:40.289 --> 00:09:43.251
But how short should I make it?

153
00:09:47.546 --> 00:09:50.466
H-Hey! Don't mess with other people's clothes!

154
00:09:50.675 --> 00:09:52.468
What did you wipe on me?!

155
00:09:54.136 --> 00:09:57.598
My trust in others...

156
00:10:00.434 --> 00:10:03.104
Finally... done...

157
00:10:24.041 --> 00:10:24.959
This is...!

158
00:10:25.167 --> 00:10:25.793
Bread!

159
00:10:26.002 --> 00:10:30.047
It's not much. but I saved it for you.

160
00:10:30.256 --> 00:10:31.757
Oh. but...

161
00:10:31.966 --> 00:10:34.218
You really ought to drink some water first.

162
00:10:38.014 --> 00:10:38.931
- Are you God?!
- Huh?!

163
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.308
- Are you?!
- Uhh...!

164
00:10:40.516 --> 00:10:41.600
God!

165
00:10:41.809 --> 00:10:45.896
Hey. What are you two doing?

166
00:10:46.105 --> 00:10:50.443
Umm. she's been running
non-stop all this time. so...

167
00:10:50.651 --> 00:10:53.738
So you're trying to do something "nice." huh?

168
00:10:53.946 --> 00:10:55.239
Huh?!

169
00:11:00.411 --> 00:11:03.122
Did you do it for Potato Girl's sake?

170
00:11:03.331 --> 00:11:06.834
Was what you gained worth the effort it took?

171
00:11:10.296 --> 00:11:12.631
Well. whatever.

172
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.885
Let's just get her to her bed now.

173
00:11:17.178 --> 00:11:19.805
Are you trying to be nice. too?

174
00:11:20.014 --> 00:11:23.184
I'm doing this so that she'll owe me.

175
00:11:23.392 --> 00:11:25.978
Her stupidity will come in very handy.

176
00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:32.777
We'll begin by determining your aptitude!

177
00:11:32.985 --> 00:11:36.072
If you can't do this. you're not even fit to be bait!

178
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.324
You'll be sent off to the fields!

179
00:11:39.742 --> 00:11:42.078
These are only just the bare fundamentals.

180
00:11:42.286 --> 00:11:45.539
Still. you can determine a person's knack
for omni-mobility at this stage.

181
00:11:46.832 --> 00:11:48.250
Observe.

182
00:11:48.459 --> 00:11:50.503
Completely steady.

183
00:11:50.711 --> 00:11:54.298
She knows exactly what to do and how to do it.

184
00:11:54.507 --> 00:11:57.593
That's what aptitude is all about.

185
00:11:57.802 --> 00:12:00.513
It looks like we have many talented cadets this year.

186
00:12:00.721 --> 00:12:03.307
Umm. what about him?

187
00:12:03.516 --> 00:12:06.352
Now that's the very definition of aptitude.

188
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.687
Some people might have plenty of motivation...

189
00:12:08.896 --> 00:12:11.899
...yet turn out to be less-than-capable.

190
00:12:12.108 --> 00:12:13.859
What are you doing. Eren Jaeger?!

191
00:12:14.068 --> 00:12:15.861
Straighten yourself up!

192
00:12:17.029 --> 00:12:18.406
What the...?!

193
00:12:18.614 --> 00:12:21.283
How do I work this thing?!

194
00:12:21.492 --> 00:12:23.035
This can't be for real...

195
00:12:35.798 --> 00:12:38.426
Just follow the basics and you'll be able to do it.

196
00:12:38.634 --> 00:12:40.928
Don't think about being fancy or anything.

197
00:12:41.137 --> 00:12:43.389
Focus on your front and back balance.

198
00:12:43.597 --> 00:12:47.017
then slowly place your weight
into the belts on your waist and feet.

199
00:12:47.226 --> 00:12:51.063
You can do it if you stay calm.
Even I did it. after all.

200
00:12:51.272 --> 00:12:53.983
All right. I feel like I've got it this time.

201
00:12:54.191 --> 00:12:55.985
Lift me up. Armin.

202
00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:12.251
Hey. Daz.

203
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:17.298
Isn't he the one who said he was
gonna slaughter all the Titans yesterday?

204
00:13:17.506 --> 00:13:20.342
I guess it's off to the fields for him tomorrow.

205
00:13:20.551 --> 00:13:22.928
Yeah. we can't afford to feed the useless.

206
00:13:23.137 --> 00:13:25.431
Eren!

207
00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:27.683
There's no point worrying about it.

208
00:13:27.892 --> 00:13:30.519
You can just learn to do it tomorrow.

209
00:13:30.728 --> 00:13:32.438
I'm pathetic...

210
00:13:32.646 --> 00:13:36.066
There's no way I can wipe them out like this...

211
00:13:36.275 --> 00:13:39.195
You should just forget about that altogether.

212
00:13:39.403 --> 00:13:40.863
What?!

213
00:13:41.071 --> 00:13:43.949
I'm saying you should give up trying to be a soldier.

214
00:13:44.158 --> 00:13:47.870
Fighting isn't about simply throwing your life away.

215
00:13:48.078 --> 00:13:52.166
Hey. now! I saw what happened that day!

216
00:13:52.374 --> 00:13:55.169
Do you really think
you can just convince me to quit?!

217
00:13:55.377 --> 00:13:58.172
Still. it doesn't matter <i>how</i> determined you are.

218
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.674
Huh? Why not?!

219
00:14:00.883 --> 00:14:05.179
Because you don't get to decide
if you're fit to be a soldier or not.

220
00:14:11.977 --> 00:14:14.605
- I'm not saying you should return...
- Let's go. Armin.

221
00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:16.774
- ...to the fields by yourself.
- Y-Yeah.

222
00:14:16.982 --> 00:14:18.943
You don't need to worry.

223
00:14:19.151 --> 00:14:23.155
Because when you go. I'll go with you.

224
00:14:27.368 --> 00:14:30.538
So. umm... What you're saying is...

225
00:14:30.746 --> 00:14:33.958
...that I can have that?

226
00:14:51.892 --> 00:14:54.395
The trick to posture control?

227
00:14:54.603 --> 00:14:58.399
Sorry. but I'm gifted. All I can tell you is to "feel" it.

228
00:14:58.607 --> 00:15:00.651
If anything. I'd like to hear <i>your</i> trick

229
00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:05.864
for staying sane after
putting on such a pathetic spectacle.

230
00:15:06.073 --> 00:15:09.618
C'mon. guys! I'm begging you here!

231
00:15:09.827 --> 00:15:15.624
But didn't you say yesterday.
"If you can't cut it here. you have to leave"?

232
00:15:15.833 --> 00:15:20.254
Or. wait. Was it. "If you don't got talent.
you have to leave"?

233
00:15:20.462 --> 00:15:22.131
Which was it again?

234
00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:26.093
Please! I heard you're both really good at it!

235
00:15:26.302 --> 00:15:28.095
Bertholdt! Reiner!

236
00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:32.725
Sorry. but I don't think there are
any tricks to just hanging there.

237
00:15:32.933 --> 00:15:36.145
I can't think of any especially helpful advice. either.

238
00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:37.313
Oh...

239
00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:39.815
I guess we'll just have to hope for the best tomorrow.

240
00:15:41.275 --> 00:15:45.195
You two are. umm. from Shiganshina. aren't you?

241
00:15:45.404 --> 00:15:46.739
Yeah...

242
00:15:46.947 --> 00:15:49.950
Then you <i>know</i> how terrifying the Titans are.

243
00:15:50.159 --> 00:15:52.494
So why do you want to be soldiers?

244
00:15:54.955 --> 00:16:00.878
Unlike Eren. I didn't witness
the Titan threat firsthand.

245
00:16:01.086 --> 00:16:02.129
It's just...

246
00:16:02.338 --> 00:16:05.257
I decided I couldn't sit there
and do nothing after the royal government

247
00:16:05.466 --> 00:16:09.094
forced people into
that absolutely awful retrieval operation.

248
00:16:09.303 --> 00:16:10.638
Oh.

249
00:16:10.846 --> 00:16:13.307
Where are you two from?

250
00:16:13.515 --> 00:16:15.934
Reiner and I are from a mountain village

251
00:16:16.143 --> 00:16:18.354
on the southeast side of Wall Maria.

252
00:16:18.562 --> 00:16:20.439
Huh?! Wasn't that...?

253
00:16:20.648 --> 00:16:21.732
Yeah.

254
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.026
Unlike the prosperous towns along the river.

255
00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:26.695
we didn't receive word right away.

256
00:16:26.904 --> 00:16:31.533
The Titans showed up
well before the information did.

257
00:16:31.742 --> 00:16:33.994
It happened at dawn.

258
00:16:34.203 --> 00:16:36.580
The livestock were acting up.

259
00:16:36.789 --> 00:16:40.876
and these strange rumblings
kept getting louder and louder.

260
00:16:41.085 --> 00:16:45.714
At some point. I realized
they were footfalls of some sort...

261
00:16:45.923 --> 00:16:49.510
And then. when I hurriedly opened the window...

262
00:16:57.643 --> 00:17:02.815
After that... l. umm. don't really remember.

263
00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:04.525
Everyone was in such a panic...

264
00:17:04.733 --> 00:17:08.237
Hey. now. What are you
suddenly bringin' that up for?

265
00:17:08.445 --> 00:17:09.780
Sorry.

266
00:17:09.988 --> 00:17:12.700
Basically. what I was trying to say

267
00:17:12.908 --> 00:17:16.787
is that you guys probably aren't like them.

268
00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:17.871
"Them"?

269
00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.375
The others here who don't know
the horror of the Titans.

270
00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:22.835
Hey!

271
00:17:29.216 --> 00:17:34.930
They're mostly here for show;
to live up to society's expectations.

272
00:17:35.139 --> 00:17:38.809
You're seen as a coward if you choose
production work when you turn twelve.

273
00:17:39.017 --> 00:17:41.812
Society has pushed them into becoming cadets.

274
00:17:43.147 --> 00:17:47.401
That said. I'm no different than them.

275
00:17:47.609 --> 00:17:49.903
I chose to be a soldier
in the hopes of joining the Military Police

276
00:17:50.112 --> 00:17:52.322
so I could work in safety of the interior.

277
00:17:52.531 --> 00:17:56.535
If that doesn't work out. I might give up entirely.

278
00:17:56.744 --> 00:18:00.497
I don't have any will to call my own. you see.

279
00:18:00.706 --> 00:18:05.419
Cherishing your life is admirable too. you know.

280
00:18:07.963 --> 00:18:09.715
As for me...

281
00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:12.301
I'm going to return to the hometown we lost.

282
00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:14.762
That's all I care about now.

283
00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.224
I <i>will</i> do it. no matter what.

284
00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:23.312
What about you?

285
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.481
Why do <i>you</i> want to be a soldier?

286
00:18:27.733 --> 00:18:28.984
I...

287
00:18:34.031 --> 00:18:37.117
I decided I have to kill them.

288
00:18:37.326 --> 00:18:41.038
I decided I have to slaughter all the Titans

289
00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:44.082
with my own two hands.

290
00:18:48.212 --> 00:18:52.424
So. your encounter with the Titans
didn't break your will?

291
00:18:52.633 --> 00:18:53.509
That's right...

292
00:18:53.717 --> 00:18:55.511
But now it's a question of whether or not

293
00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:58.430
I'm actually cut out to be a soldier.

294
00:19:18.075 --> 00:19:20.494
Start over from scratch.
starting with your belt adjustment.

295
00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:23.372
You'll do just fine tomorrow.

296
00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.666
I'm certain of it.

297
00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:28.710
Eren Jaeger. was it?

298
00:19:28.919 --> 00:19:31.338
Yeah. Thanks.

299
00:19:31.547 --> 00:19:34.091
Reiner Braun. right?

300
00:19:43.892 --> 00:19:46.770
Eren Jaeger. Are you ready?

301
00:19:46.979 --> 00:19:47.980
Yes. Sir!

302
00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:51.149
I'm going to do it! I am!

303
00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:54.194
I might not have raw aptitude.

304
00:19:54.403 --> 00:19:57.781
but no one has more guts than I do!

305
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.491
Begin!

306
00:20:06.874 --> 00:20:08.667
The hell with logic!

307
00:20:08.876 --> 00:20:10.544
I know it's completely baseless!

308
00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:13.797
But guts are all I got!

309
00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:15.674
They're...

310
00:20:15.883 --> 00:20:17.801
...my weapon!

311
00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:23.515
I did it!

312
00:20:23.724 --> 00:20:25.309
I'm doing it!

313
00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:36.153
N-Not yet!

314
00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:39.031
I can still do it!

315
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:41.992
Let him down.

316
00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.416
I-I'm...!

317
00:20:50.292 --> 00:20:53.295
Wagner. Switch belts with Jaeger.

318
00:20:53.503 --> 00:20:54.922
Y-Yes. Sir!

319
00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:05.098
Your equipment was defective.

320
00:21:05.307 --> 00:21:09.353
The belt you were using had a broken clasp.

321
00:21:09.561 --> 00:21:12.689
I've never heard of this part breaking before;

322
00:21:12.898 --> 00:21:15.901
I guess we'll have to add it
to the maintenance checklist.

323
00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:19.655
Then. even with broken equipment.
he still managed to...?!

324
00:21:19.863 --> 00:21:21.365
Whoa!

325
00:21:21.573 --> 00:21:25.118
Th-Then. am I fit to be a soldier?!

326
00:21:25.327 --> 00:21:28.497
You pass muster. Train hard!

327
00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:32.000
I did it! I did it!

328
00:21:32.209 --> 00:21:35.253
Whadya think of that. Mikasa?! I can do it!

329
00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:37.756
I can fight the Titans!

330
00:21:37.965 --> 00:21:41.176
You can finally stop mollycoddling me!

331
00:21:42.511 --> 00:21:44.471
Looks like things worked out for him.

332
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.848
His eyes say. "What do you think of that?!"

333
00:21:47.057 --> 00:21:48.225
No.

334
00:21:49.935 --> 00:21:54.815
He feels relieved that
he doesn't have to leave me now.

335
00:21:58.068 --> 00:21:59.403
Grisha...

336
00:21:59.611 --> 00:22:04.449
Today. your son has become a soldier.

337
00:22:40.527 --> 00:22:45.240
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

338
00:22:45.449 --> 00:22:51.496
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

339
00:22:51.705 --> 00:22:56.209
<i>Over and over you cast them aside.
only to find more</i>

340
00:22:56.418 --> 00:23:02.924
<i>Now. rest in peace</i>

341
00:23:03.133 --> 00:23:14.019
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

342
00:23:14.227 --> 00:23:24.529
<i>and the more we forget
the more we remember again</i>

343
00:23:24.738 --> 00:23:30.494
<i>In this beautiful. cruel world</i>

344
00:23:30.702 --> 00:23:35.791
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

345
00:23:35.999 --> 00:23:41.421
<i>Oh. with our strength...and our weakness...</i>

346
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:46.968
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

347
00:23:47.177 --> 00:23:51.765
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

348
00:23:57.395 --> 00:23:59.856
After graduating from the Cadets.

349
00:24:00.065 --> 00:24:03.777
Eren sees humanity and its regained dignity.

350
00:24:03.985 --> 00:24:05.612
"We can beat the Titans."

351
00:24:05.821 --> 00:24:10.575
The moment he feels certain of this.
humanity is reminded yet again...
