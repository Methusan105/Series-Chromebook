00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:09.219
In the year 850. the Colossal Titan
reappeared and demolished another wall.

2
00:00:09.427 --> 00:00:13.890
Once again. humanity allowed
the Titans to further their advance.

3
00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.061
One after another.
soldiers fell to the Titans.

4
00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:19.688
And then...

5
00:00:19.896 --> 00:00:20.855
Eren!

6
00:00:21.064 --> 00:00:22.482
Hurry!

7
00:00:29.656 --> 00:00:32.701
Eren fell prey to a Titan too.

8
00:00:33.535 --> 00:00:35.870
Man. Mikasa's incredible...

9
00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.123
How can she move so fast?!

10
00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:41.209
No! She's not her usual.
composed self at all!

11
00:00:41.418 --> 00:00:43.294
I'll do whatever it takes to win!

12
00:00:43.503 --> 00:00:45.755
Whatever it takes to live!

13
00:00:46.548 --> 00:00:49.426
Mikasa found herself in
dire straits as well

14
00:00:49.634 --> 00:00:53.346
when a mysterious Titan
appeared and attacked another Titan.

15
00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:21.249
<i>Unknown are the names
of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

16
00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:26.713
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth
and long for the wind</i>

17
00:01:26.921 --> 00:01:31.801
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

18
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.140
<i>Only the will to fight
can change the here and now!</i>

19
00:01:37.348 --> 00:01:42.437
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve
to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

20
00:01:42.645 --> 00:01:44.981
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

21
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.859
<i>Give us the freedom of dying.
starving wolves!</i>

22
00:01:48.067 --> 00:01:53.239
<i>The humiliation of being caged
is what triggers us to fight back</i>

23
00:01:53.448 --> 00:01:58.536
<i>We hunters slaughter prey
beyond the castle walls.</i>

24
00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:03.750
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust.</i>

25
00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:10.882
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows
pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

26
00:02:38.868 --> 00:02:39.661
There!

27
00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:43.331
Your mobility gear still works.
and I've given you all my blades.

28
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.126
All I ask is that you
leave me with this one...

29
00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:52.298
I'd rather not get
eaten alive. if I can help it.

30
00:02:58.221 --> 00:03:00.306
N-No way...

31
00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.767
Armin.

32
00:03:04.978 --> 00:03:07.564
I'm not leaving you here.

33
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.070
B-But the place is swarming with Titans;

34
00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:16.281
you can't possibly
carry someone while jumping..

35
00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:17.907
Let's go!

36
00:03:19.576 --> 00:03:21.160
No...

37
00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:22.996
Please don't...

38
00:03:23.204 --> 00:03:25.248
I'll only...

39
00:03:25.456 --> 00:03:28.668
I'll only get more of my friends killed!

40
00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:40.930
Wait!

41
00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.433
Listen! I have a suggestion!

42
00:03:43.641 --> 00:03:45.268
A suggestion?

43
00:03:46.728 --> 00:03:51.566
Only you two can do it.
so I leave the choice to you...

44
00:03:51.774 --> 00:03:53.902
I know it sounds crazy.

45
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.029
but could we use
that Titan to our advantage?

46
00:03:56.237 --> 00:03:57.530
That Titan?!

47
00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.659
It attacks other Titans and
doesn't show any interest in us.

48
00:04:01.868 --> 00:04:06.539
So I'm wondering if we
could lead it to the supply building...

49
00:04:06.748 --> 00:04:11.669
If it takes out the other Titans
for us. we just might all survive!

50
00:04:11.878 --> 00:04:15.673
<i>Lead</i> it?! How do you
hope to lead that thing?!

51
00:04:15.882 --> 00:04:18.676
My guess is it's fighting on instinct.

52
00:04:18.885 --> 00:04:22.722
If you two take out the Titans around it.

53
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:26.559
it'll go and look for other Titans.

54
00:04:26.768 --> 00:04:28.853
That'll naturally lead
it toward Headquarters.

55
00:04:29.062 --> 00:04:32.440
W-We can't risk our
necks for some hopeful guess!

56
00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:35.485
But if it works. we could eliminate
all the Titans attacking HQ

57
00:04:35.693 --> 00:04:37.654
in one fell swoop!

58
00:04:39.405 --> 00:04:41.449
- It seems worth trying.
- Huh?!

59
00:04:41.658 --> 00:04:43.034
Are you serious?!

60
00:04:43.242 --> 00:04:47.455
It's better to take a gamble than
wait for our inevitable deaths.

61
00:04:47.664 --> 00:04:50.041
Let's go with Armin's suggestion.

62
00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:53.044
You want us to
fight Titans with a Titan?!

63
00:04:53.252 --> 00:04:55.254
Yes. I do.

64
00:04:58.299 --> 00:05:00.885
If we fail. we'll be laughingstocks.

65
00:05:02.011 --> 00:05:05.181
But if we succeed. everyone survives.

66
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.392
It all comes down to resolve.

67
00:05:09.227 --> 00:05:11.312
All right! Fine!

68
00:05:17.193 --> 00:05:19.696
Am I really cut out for this?

69
00:05:20.947 --> 00:05:25.618
Am I really fit to have
a position of responsibility?

70
00:05:30.415 --> 00:05:31.916
No!

71
00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:35.545
No... <i>now</i> is the time.

72
00:05:35.753 --> 00:05:40.174
Now is our chance. while the
Titans are preoccupied over there!

73
00:05:42.468 --> 00:05:43.886
Now!

74
00:05:44.762 --> 00:05:47.390
Make for HQ while we have the chance!

75
00:05:58.067 --> 00:05:59.360
Now is our only chance!

76
00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:02.697
If we run out of gas.
it's all over anyway!

77
00:06:02.905 --> 00:06:04.741
Everyone. charge!

78
00:06:51.871 --> 00:06:53.289
- Jean!
- Huh?

79
00:06:53.498 --> 00:06:56.292
Thanks! You helped us get away!

80
00:06:56.501 --> 00:06:57.502
Huh?!

81
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:58.753
It's all thanks to you!

82
00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:03.424
It's like I said before!
You make a good leader!

83
00:07:03.633 --> 00:07:06.344
I'm not so sure about that!

84
00:07:15.353 --> 00:07:16.771
Damn!

85
00:07:34.956 --> 00:07:37.250
How many made it?

86
00:07:39.961 --> 00:07:42.004
How many comrades' deaths did I use?!

87
00:07:42.213 --> 00:07:46.425
How many people
died because of my orders?

88
00:07:55.893 --> 00:07:59.522
You're with the
supply team. aren't you?

89
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.149
Yeah...

90
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.361
Stop. Jean!

91
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.489
<i>These</i> are the ones who abandoned us!

92
00:08:08.698 --> 00:08:11.409
People are dead because of you guys!

93
00:08:11.617 --> 00:08:14.245
The Titans overran the supply room!

94
00:08:14.453 --> 00:08:15.830
There was nothing we could do!

95
00:08:16.038 --> 00:08:19.375
It's your job to deal with it anyway!

96
00:08:22.378 --> 00:08:24.005
Hit the deck!

97
00:08:29.552 --> 00:08:30.761
Crap...!

98
00:08:31.262 --> 00:08:34.182
There are too many people!

99
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:35.558
- Hurry!
- Get further inside!

100
00:08:35.766 --> 00:08:37.435
Stop! We can't all go at once!

101
00:08:37.643 --> 00:08:39.020
Where'd Mikasa go?!

102
00:08:39.228 --> 00:08:42.690
She ran out of gas!
She's long gone by now!

103
00:08:43.024 --> 00:08:44.650
<i>This</i> is normal...

104
00:08:44.859 --> 00:08:47.987
This must be what the real world is like...

105
00:08:48.196 --> 00:08:52.700
Was I trying to
delude myself up until now?

106
00:08:52.909 --> 00:08:57.830
Surely I knew what
the real world was like...

107
00:08:58.039 --> 00:09:01.876
It's so obvious when you think about it...

108
00:09:02.543 --> 00:09:07.465
There's no way we stand a
chance against these monstrosities...

109
00:09:16.307 --> 00:09:17.725
What?!

110
00:09:28.486 --> 00:09:29.820
Huh?

111
00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:31.948
What the hell...?

112
00:09:36.077 --> 00:09:36.953
Mikasa!

113
00:09:37.161 --> 00:09:40.206
Man. that was close.
It's completely empty.

114
00:09:40.414 --> 00:09:43.626
We did it! We managed to make it!

115
00:09:43.834 --> 00:09:46.879
Wh-Whoa. you're alive!

116
00:09:47.088 --> 00:09:48.422
- We did it. Armin!
- O-Ouch!

117
00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:51.259
Your plan worked!

118
00:09:51.467 --> 00:09:52.260
Guys!

119
00:09:52.468 --> 00:09:55.429
That Titan's an Abnormal!
It's killin' all the other Titans!

120
00:09:55.638 --> 00:09:58.766
<i>And</i> it has no interest in us!

121
00:09:58.975 --> 00:10:02.812
We can use it to our
advantage to escape from here!

122
00:10:03.813 --> 00:10:05.898
Use a Titan?!

123
00:10:06.107 --> 00:10:08.484
A Titan. helping us?!

124
00:10:08.693 --> 00:10:12.154
- What kind of nonsensical dream...
- It's no dream.

125
00:10:12.363 --> 00:10:14.699
Whether it's an Abnormal
or not. I don't care.

126
00:10:14.907 --> 00:10:19.203
We're going to let it rampage
here for as long as possible.

127
00:10:23.249 --> 00:10:29.922
Because. realistically. that's our
best strategy for survival now.

128
00:10:51.402 --> 00:10:52.820
It's okay.

129
00:10:53.029 --> 00:10:56.324
That Titan's tougher than ordinary ones.

130
00:10:59.702 --> 00:11:02.538
I doubt they'll take down this building

131
00:11:02.747 --> 00:11:06.834
while that one's rampaging like crazy.

132
00:11:07.043 --> 00:11:11.255
How much do you know about that Titan?

133
00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.343
We can worry about that <i>after</i> we're safe.

134
00:11:15.551 --> 00:11:18.721
Yeah. Let's survive first.

135
00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:20.473
We found some!

136
00:11:20.681 --> 00:11:23.100
They belong to the Military Police!

137
00:11:23.309 --> 00:11:26.103
Damn things are all covered in dust...

138
00:11:27.271 --> 00:11:30.441
Are you sure buckshot
is what we want to use?!

139
00:11:30.649 --> 00:11:33.152
I mean. seriously...

140
00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:37.448
Will guns even work against Titans?

141
00:11:39.116 --> 00:11:41.827
They're far better than nothing. I feel.

142
00:11:42.036 --> 00:11:45.956
If there are still seven Titans in the supply
room that are three or four meters tall.

143
00:11:46.165 --> 00:11:51.212
this much firepower should be capable
of blinding them all simultaneously.

144
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.841
First. we'll use the lift to lower a
group of people from the center ceiling.

145
00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:00.388
They'll then simultaneously fire
at the faces of each of the seven Titans.

146
00:12:00.596 --> 00:12:02.181
thereby blinding them.

147
00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:07.186
Then comes the moment of truth...

148
00:12:07.395 --> 00:12:09.146
Seven people hiding up top

149
00:12:09.355 --> 00:12:13.442
will strike the Titans'
vitals just after the guns fire.

150
00:12:13.651 --> 00:12:18.531
In other words. this plan
will put everything on the line...

151
00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:20.658
everyone's lives on the line...

152
00:12:20.866 --> 00:12:22.493
for a single attack.

153
00:12:23.619 --> 00:12:28.958
Seven people will have to slay seven
Titans at the same time in a single blow.

154
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:35.464
It'll be up to the seven most physically
fit and adept soldiers we have here.

155
00:12:35.673 --> 00:12:41.262
So. umm. I'm sorry for placing
everyone's lives on your shoulders...

156
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.721
It's no problem.

157
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:47.059
If we fail. we die. The risk's
the same regardless of who goes.

158
00:12:47.268 --> 00:12:53.941
Still. is this shabby idea of
mine really our best strategy?

159
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:59.697
We got no other choice.
We're out of time and options.

160
00:12:59.905 --> 00:13:01.866
All we can do now is give it our all!

161
00:13:02.074 --> 00:13:05.619
It'll be fine. Be confident.

162
00:13:05.828 --> 00:13:08.164
You have a knack for
figuring out correct solutions.

163
00:13:08.372 --> 00:13:09.206
Huh?

164
00:13:09.415 --> 00:13:13.210
You even used it to save
my life and Eren's life before.

165
00:13:13.419 --> 00:13:17.047
It did...? When?

166
00:13:18.257 --> 00:13:19.967
The lift's ready!

167
00:13:20.176 --> 00:13:22.803
The guns too! They're all loaded!

168
00:13:23.012 --> 00:13:24.722
You just don't realize it.

169
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.099
- We can talk about it later.
- Yeah.

170
00:13:29.518 --> 00:13:34.732
Still. can we really take out all
the Titans without our ODM gear?

171
00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.066
Of course we can!

172
00:13:36.275 --> 00:13:38.319
These Titans are only three or four meters tall.

173
00:13:38.527 --> 00:13:40.571
Targeting their vitals will be a cinch.

174
00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:41.655
Yeah.

175
00:13:41.864 --> 00:13:45.701
Regardless of size. their vitals go
from the head to the nape of the neck...

176
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:48.704
...one meter high and ten centimeters across!

177
00:13:48.913 --> 00:13:51.832
You can also shove
one of these up their asses!

178
00:13:52.041 --> 00:13:53.918
Those are their only two weak spots!

179
00:13:54.126 --> 00:13:56.712
I never knew about that one!

180
00:13:56.921 --> 00:13:59.507
This is the first I've heard of it. too.

181
00:13:59.715 --> 00:14:01.008
Reiner.

182
00:14:01.217 --> 00:14:04.929
Those <i>could</i> end up
being your last words. you know.

183
00:14:18.192 --> 00:14:21.111
Good. Their numbers haven't increased.

184
00:14:26.575 --> 00:14:29.119
Proceeding with operation!

185
00:14:38.212 --> 00:14:41.674
Stay clam! We need
to lure them all the way in!

186
00:14:46.011 --> 00:14:47.429
Steady...

187
00:14:49.932 --> 00:14:52.560
Avoid a disadvantageous fight...

188
00:14:52.768 --> 00:14:55.271
If you don't want <i>anyone</i> to die...

189
00:14:55.479 --> 00:14:58.357
...then make this attack count!

190
00:14:59.275 --> 00:15:01.110
Steady...

191
00:15:08.659 --> 00:15:10.077
Ready...

192
00:15:15.833 --> 00:15:17.251
Fire!

193
00:15:26.427 --> 00:15:27.219
I got mine!

194
00:15:27.428 --> 00:15:29.555
How about you guys?!

195
00:15:38.022 --> 00:15:39.607
U-Umm...

196
00:15:39.815 --> 00:15:42.651
- I'm sorry for suddenly sneaking up and...
- C-Crap...

197
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.362
I'm very sorry...!

198
00:15:45.571 --> 00:15:46.739
Sasha and Conny!

199
00:15:46.947 --> 00:15:49.074
Hurry! Lend them backup!

200
00:15:50.743 --> 00:15:54.496
I'm... umm...

201
00:15:54.705 --> 00:15:56.707
I'm very sorry!

202
00:16:08.469 --> 00:16:10.638
Mikasa!

203
00:16:10.846 --> 00:16:12.973
You saved me!

204
00:16:13.182 --> 00:16:14.099
Are you all right?

205
00:16:14.308 --> 00:16:15.225
Thanks to you!

206
00:16:15.434 --> 00:16:16.810
Then get up.

207
00:16:17.019 --> 00:16:18.395
I owe you one...

208
00:16:18.604 --> 00:16:19.438
No problem.

209
00:16:19.647 --> 00:16:21.398
Oh. man.

210
00:16:21.607 --> 00:16:23.525
That was a close call. Annie.

211
00:16:23.734 --> 00:16:26.278
I'm really glad you didn't end up hurt.

212
00:16:26.487 --> 00:16:28.405
They've all been slain!

213
00:16:28.614 --> 00:16:29.990
Switch to resupply work!

214
00:16:30.199 --> 00:16:32.034
We did it!

215
00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:41.001
- All right! We're gonna survive!
- And no more Titans are coming inside!

216
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:44.338
All thanks to that
berserk Titan out there!

217
00:16:45.756 --> 00:16:48.425
I caved in to that Titan...

218
00:16:48.634 --> 00:16:50.552
I'm too ashamed to face the others...!

219
00:16:50.761 --> 00:16:52.554
There'll be plenty of
time to sneer at you later!

220
00:16:52.763 --> 00:16:54.348
For now. we gotta escape!

221
00:16:55.391 --> 00:16:58.769
I can't see myself as much of a leader.

222
00:16:58.977 --> 00:17:01.271
Don't talk like that anymore.

223
00:17:05.234 --> 00:17:07.986
I don't mean any offense by this.

224
00:17:08.195 --> 00:17:10.989
but I think the fact you aren't strong

225
00:17:11.198 --> 00:17:13.826
really lets you understand
how the weak feel.

226
00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:18.330
And your skill at recognizing
a situation as it unfolds

227
00:17:18.539 --> 00:17:22.501
gives you a clear grasp of what
needs to be done <i>now.</i> you know?

228
00:17:23.544 --> 00:17:25.796
You made the right call.

229
00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:29.842
It's what got me moving.
It's why I'm alive now.

230
00:17:35.597 --> 00:17:38.016
Everyone ready?! It's time to scram!

231
00:17:38.225 --> 00:17:41.061
- Let's move!
- Scale the wall!

232
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.272
Rendezvous with the main forces!

233
00:17:45.149 --> 00:17:46.567
Mikasa?!

234
00:17:50.696 --> 00:17:51.780
Mikasa!

235
00:17:51.989 --> 00:17:53.741
We have to get out of here!

236
00:17:53.949 --> 00:17:55.659
That Titan...

237
00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:01.498
They're cannibalizing it?!

238
00:18:03.959 --> 00:18:06.712
I guess it can't regenerate its body?

239
00:18:07.838 --> 00:18:11.425
I thought that if we could somehow
figure out what's up with that Titan.

240
00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:16.847
it could've helped us break
free from this hopeless situation...

241
00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:18.766
I agree.

242
00:18:18.974 --> 00:18:22.644
We'll learn nothing at all
if it ends up getting eaten!

243
00:18:22.853 --> 00:18:26.774
For now. we have to get
rid of the ones clinging to it

244
00:18:26.982 --> 00:18:28.358
and help keep it alive!

245
00:18:28.567 --> 00:18:29.777
Are you insane. Reiner?!

246
00:18:29.985 --> 00:18:32.613
We can finally get our asses out of here!

247
00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:37.951
And what if there's a chance
that Titan could become our ally?

248
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.038
It'd be a more powerful weapon
than any cannon. wouldn't you agree?

249
00:18:42.164 --> 00:18:43.624
Ally...?

250
00:18:43.832 --> 00:18:45.667
Are you actually serious?!

251
00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:48.587
That one...!

252
00:18:49.254 --> 00:18:52.674
That's the Abnormal that ate Thomas!

253
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:27.668
Oh. man...

254
00:19:32.673 --> 00:19:35.509
What was it you wanted to save again?

255
00:19:42.224 --> 00:19:45.978
Looks like it's finished for good.

256
00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:48.522
All right. that's enough! Let's get going!

257
00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.358
As if that monster would ever be our ally...

258
00:19:51.567 --> 00:19:53.610
A Titan's a Titan.

259
00:19:58.198 --> 00:20:00.200
What's with you guys?

260
00:20:24.099 --> 00:20:25.517
Mikasa!

261
00:21:34.836 --> 00:21:36.672
It's Eren...

262
00:21:37.923 --> 00:21:43.637
His severed arm and leg are back...

263
00:21:43.845 --> 00:21:48.850
He'd been swallowed by a Titan back then...

264
00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:50.477
Back then...

265
00:21:59.528 --> 00:22:03.073
How is this possible?

266
00:22:10.747 --> 00:22:17.879
Does this mean Eren did all this...?

267
00:22:37.524 --> 00:22:42.446
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

268
00:22:42.654 --> 00:22:48.702
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

269
00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:53.373
<i>Over and over you cast them aside.
only to find more</i>

270
00:22:53.582 --> 00:23:00.047
<i>Now. rest in peace</i>

271
00:23:00.255 --> 00:23:11.391
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

272
00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:21.651
<i>and the more we forget
the more we remember again</i>

273
00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:27.616
<i>In this beautiful. cruel world</i>

274
00:23:27.824 --> 00:23:32.788
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

275
00:23:32.996 --> 00:23:38.502
<i>Oh. with our strength... and our weakness...</i>

276
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:44.174
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

277
00:23:44.382 --> 00:23:47.803
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

278
00:23:54.142 --> 00:23:56.353
"I'm going to drive out the Titans."

279
00:23:56.561 --> 00:24:00.941
That strong emotion
transformed Eren into a Titan.

280
00:24:01.149 --> 00:24:05.654
However. the Garrison Regiment
deems him a threat to humanity

281
00:24:05.862 --> 00:24:08.031
and turns its swords at him.

9999
