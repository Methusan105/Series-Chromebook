Draw your blades.

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.770
If we see it. it'll only be for a second.

3
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.790
Go!

4
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.600
It's fast!

5
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:36.589
In these trees. there's no way to
foresee and evade its attacks!

6
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.640
It'll catch us!

7
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.810
Captain. let's switch to Maneuver Gear!

8
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.690
Captain!

9
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.190
You won't escape!

10
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.120
Reinforcements from the rear!

11
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.919
Captain. your orders?!

12
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.089
Let's go for it!

13
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.589
It's dangerous...

14
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.289
We should kill it!

15
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.079
At this rate. it <i>will</i> catch up with us!

16
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.220
We kill it here...

17
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.499
That's why we came to this forest!

18
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.479
Right. Captain?

19
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.590
Captain. your orders!

20
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.800
Everyone. cover your ears.

57 th Expedition Beyond the Walls (3)

23
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.810
A noise grenade?

24
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.460
What is your job?

25
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.820
To just let yourself be swayed by whatever
you're feeling at the moment?

26
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.000
No. it's not.

27
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.820
Our squad's job

28
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.960
is to keep the brat from getting
a single scratch on him.

29
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.330
Even if it costs our lives.

30
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.460
It wasn't to keep watch on me?

31
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.130
We keep going on our horses. got it?

32
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.440
Roger!

33
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.470
Keep going? For how long?

34
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.700
And it's right on top of us...

35
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.480
Again!

36
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.269
The reinforcements!

37
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.730
If we don't help. they'll
be wiped out again!

38
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.570
Eren. eyes on the road!

39
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:11.780
Sir!

40
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.859
Keep your pace up...

41
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.399
Stay at top speed!

42
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.240
But. sir...

43
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.189
Why?!

44
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.790
If Squad Levi doesn't defeat it. who will?

45
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.460
Another one's dead...

46
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.460
And maybe we could've saved him!

47
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.879
One's still fighting...

48
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.220
We could still make it!

49
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.550
Eren. eyes back on the road! Keep going!

50
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.639
Are you telling me to look away?

51
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.599
To abandon my comrades and run?!

52
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.099
Yes. that's right!

53
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.810
Obey the Captain's orders!

54
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.150
I don't understand why
we're leaving them to die!

55
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.959
Or why he won't explain!

56
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.820
Why?!

57
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.239
That's because the Captain decided
the reason should not be explained.

58
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.200
You just don't understand
because you're still green!

59
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.060
If you get it. then shut up and obey!

60
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.080
No...

61
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.300
I can fight on my own.

62
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.430
Why am I relying on others?

63
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.100
I can just fight on my own.

64
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.390
What are you doing. Eren?

65
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.439
You're only allowed to do that
if your life is in danger.

66
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.110
You promised us!

67
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.320
Eren!

68
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.450
You aren't wrong.

69
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.620
If you want to. do it.

70
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.860
I can tell.

71
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.880
He's a real monster.

72
00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.710
And it has nothing to do
with his Titan power.

73
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.149
No matter what power you
use to suppress him.

74
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.430
no matter what cage you put him in.

75
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.800
he will never submit to anyone.

76
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.140
I just want
to slaughter the Titans.

77
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:18.020
Eren. the difference between your
decision and ours is experience.

78
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.780
But you don't have to rely on that.

79
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.120
Choose.

80
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.660
Believe in yourself.

81
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.500
Or believe in the Survey Corps and me.

82
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.959
I don't know...

83
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.490
I never have.

84
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.840
I can believe in my own abilities

85
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.680
or the choices of companions I trust.

86
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.180
But no one ever knows how it will turn out.

87
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:51.890
So choose for yourself whichever
decision you'll regret least.

88
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.450
Eren!

89
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:13.870
Have faith!

90
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.540
I came up with a way
that'd only half-kill you.

91
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.600
Sir?

92
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.590
I said I'd only be able to stop
you as a Titan if I killed you.

93
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.479
But this method would only badly wound you.

94
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.520
Of course. it relies on the squad's skill.

95
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.720
The idea is to cut you right
out of the Titan's neck.

96
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.110
We'd end up cutting the ends
of your arms and legs off.

97
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.679
but they'd just grow
back like a lizard's...

98
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.950
Creepy. really.

99
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.710
Wait.

100
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.289
I don't know how they grow back.

101
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:00.920
Is there some other way...

102
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:07.600
So you're saying you don't want there
to be any danger or sacrifice?

103
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.300
N-No...

104
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.140
Then just resolve yourself.

105
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.980
We will. too...

106
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.550
The danger for us is
that you might kill us.

107
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.600
So don't worry.

108
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.859
Yes... Understood.

109
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.820
Th-Then. I can do experiments?

110
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.199
It's very risky.

111
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.240
But that doesn't mean that we
can't use him to investigate.

112
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.120
I can be in charge of planning this. right?

113
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.319
Eren. if there's something
you don't understand.

114
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.540
learn to understand it.

115
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.580
It's well worth any risk to our lives.

116
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.920
Ready. Eren?

117
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.640
When it's prepared. I'll use the
smoke round to notify you.

118
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.310
After that. any decisions are up to you.

119
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.400
Roger!

120
00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:05.089
This dried-up well could hold
even a mindless Titan...

121
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.190
Probably!

122
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.960
That's the signal.

123
00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:15.100
Since I sealed the wall. I haven't
tried to control the Titan.

124
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:22.320
If I lose control. Squad Levi
might kill me this time...

125
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.840
Did he not see the signal?

126
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.180
No...

127
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.450
His ability just isn't that reliable.

128
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.190
Hey. Eren! We're calling it quits for now.

129
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.950
Did something happen?

130
00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.620
Hanji...

131
00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.840
I can't become a Titan.

132
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.380
So your self-inflicted bite wounds on
your hands aren't healing. either?

133
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:11.600
No.

134
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.039
If you can't transform into a Titan.

135
00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.620
our main goal of sealing
Wall Maria is off the table.

136
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.689
This is an order...

137
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.310
Make it happen.

138
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.950
Yes. sir.

139
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.940
Don't let it get you down. Eren.

140
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.969
But...

141
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.870
Well. it just means you're
more human than I thought.

142
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.110
Better than rushing into
something and getting killed.

143
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.000
This isn't meaningless.

144
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.519
Yeah...

145
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.050
We can't be too careful.

146
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.860
Why is everyone so calm?

147
00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.840
Are they okay with my being
unable to turn into a Titan?

148
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:07.879
Are you okay?

149
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:08.970
Yes...

150
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.270
Hey...

151
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.110
What's that?

152
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.420
What was that explosion?

153
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.789
Why now?!

154
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:40.680
Calm down.

155
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.480
Captain Levi!

156
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.110
This is...

157
00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.730
I said to calm down.

158
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.966
All of you.

159
00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.640
What? What was that sound?

160
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.990
Eren...

161
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:35.780
What's the meaning of this?!

162
00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.280
Sir?

163
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.609
Why now? Without permission?

164
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:40.330
Answer me!

165
00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.330
Eldo. wait.

166
00:12:41.331 --> 00:12:42.569
Answer him. Eren!

167
00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:43.540
What are you thinking?

168
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.080
No. that can wait...

169
00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.090
Prove you're not our
enemy. humanity's enemy!

170
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.899
Prove it! Now!

171
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.629
That is your responsibility!

172
00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.159
I dare you to make a
single move with that arm!

173
00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.930
I'll cut off your head!

174
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.399
I can do it... I'm serious!

175
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.429
Want to try me?

176
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:05.370
Oluo.

177
00:13:05.371 --> 00:13:06.559
I said to calm down.

178
00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.049
Captain. get away from Eren!

179
00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:09.650
You're too close!

180
00:13:09.651 --> 00:13:12.579
No. you're the ones who should get back.

181
00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.110
Get back.

182
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.900
Why?!

183
00:13:13.901 --> 00:13:14.939
My intuition.

184
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:15.989
What's wrong. Eren?

185
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.219
Say something!

186
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:17.690
Like I said...

187
00:13:17.691 --> 00:13:18.819
No sudden movements!

188
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.489
Prove it to me. Eren!

189
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:21.420
I said I don't understand.

190
00:13:21.421 --> 00:13:24.129
Answer us! You think we can't kill you?

191
00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.299
I'm serious!

192
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.130
Do it now!

193
00:13:26.131 --> 00:13:27.199
Are you even listening?

194
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.170
Okay. let's do this!

195
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.100
Are you humanity's...

196
00:13:29.101 --> 00:13:31.540
Please shut up for a second!

197
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:40.010
Eren!

198
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.390
Can I touch that arm?!

199
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.479
It's okay. right? Right?

200
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.939
Just let me touch it!

201
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.189
Hanji...

202
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:50.430
Wait a second!

203
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.069
It's... hot!

204
00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.959
Without the skin. it's really damned hot!

205
00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.869
Unbelievably hot!

206
00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:00.700
Squad Leader.

207
00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.989
you're too reckless!

208
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:05.699
Hey. don't you feel it's hot. Eren?

209
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.779
How does it feel where
the right hand connects?

210
00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.649
I really want to see!

211
00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:11.709
That's right...

212
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.520
If I just pull out this hand...

213
00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:16.510
Stupid thing!

214
00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.039
Hey. Eren...

215
00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.220
Don't do anything rash!

216
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.299
What?!

217
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.480
Wait. Eren... That was too fast!

218
00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.940
I still wanted to
investigate some things...

219
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.200
Captain...

220
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.450
How do you feel?

221
00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:59.920
Not... Not so good...

222
00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:10.860
Until I saw that they were actually ready
to kill me. I didn't understand...

223
00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.790
That they doubted me so much.

224
00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:16.740
Of course they do.

225
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.400
That's why I chose them.

226
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:24.149
People say you only truly become a
full member of the Survey Corps

227
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.410
after making it back alive from a mission.

228
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.220
But whenever you fight the Titans.
you never have enough information.

229
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.850
There are too many situations you just
can't anticipate. no matter what.

230
00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.299
They've had to cultivate the
ability to take quick action

231
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.120
and to make ruthless decisions by assuming
the worse case scenario.

232
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.550
But that doesn't mean
they've become heartless.

233
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:51.680
It's not like they felt nothing when
they turned their swords on you.

234
00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:54.120
Captain Levi...

235
00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.100
Squad Leader Hanji wants to see you.

236
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.509
Take a long crap?

237
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.570
Actually. it was pleasantly quick.

238
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.630
I wasn't sure what to tell the brass.

239
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.850
Well. for now...

240
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:12.900
Look at this.

241
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.579
A teaspoon?

242
00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.540
Yes.

243
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.819
The right Titan hand Eren
created was holding this.

244
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:25.800
Like this. between its
index finger and thumb.

245
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:30.510
It's hard to imagine
that was an accident...

246
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.369
And for some reason.

247
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.440
the heat and pressure didn't
warp the spoon at all.

248
00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:37.310
Anything come to mind?

249
00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.860
I was trying to pick it up...

250
00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:43.570
I transformed right after.

251
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.150
I see...

252
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.910
That may explain why you
couldn't transform earlier.

253
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:54.170
"Kill the Titans."

254
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:55.710
"Block the cannon shell."

255
00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.790
"Lift the boulder."

256
00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:03.030
In each case. you had a clear
goal before you transformed.

257
00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:05.369
My theory is

258
00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:08.520
that your self-inflicted injury
probably isn't the sole trigger.

259
00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.100
You may need some goal. as well.

260
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.399
It's true that when I turned
into a Titan this time.

261
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.190
it was like when I blocked
that cannon shell.

262
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:19.650
But...

263
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.240
I turned into a Titan to pick up a spoon?

264
00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.540
What the hell is this?

265
00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:33.040
In other words. you didn't deliberately
change without permission?

266
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:34.560
No. sir.

267
00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.550
Huh? Eh?

268
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:54.010
Wait. what are you doing?

269
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.090
That hurt...

270
00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.740
This isn't easy.

271
00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:02.590
I'm amazed you can bite through. Eren.

272
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.280
We made the wrong decision.

273
00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.810
This is a small price to pay.

274
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.530
Not that it makes a difference.

275
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:14.440
Keeping you under control is our job.

276
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.100
And there's nothing wrong with that.

277
00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.330
So don't get cocky!

278
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:21.290
I'm sorry. Eren...

279
00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.840
We've been so jumpy.

280
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:26.330
You must be disappointed in our stupidity.

281
00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.610
However. even so...

282
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.160
We're going to rely on you.
And we want you to rely on us.

283
00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:40.540
So...

284
00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:44.520
Have faith in us...

285
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:55.370
Eren!

286
00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.040
You're taking too long! Decide!

287
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:02.330
I'll go forward!

288
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:10.720
Let me go!

289
00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.140
I'm sorry!

290
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:27.270
Target is accelerating!

291
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:29.049
Go!

292
00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:30.410
We will outrun it.

293
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.510
It's impossible to outrun it...

294
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:41.100
If we keep running away.
it'll stomp us all flat!

295
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:45.330
But...

296
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.590
We might all die.

297
00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.840
but everyone chose to go on.

298
00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:52.340
even if it meant abandoning our comrades.

299
00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.650
Captain Levi has been looking
forward this whole time.

300
00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:58.900
And the rest of the squad

301
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.850
believe in him. and put
all their trust in him.

302
00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:07.360
I'll believe in them. too...

303
00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:10.360
Like they

304
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.580
believed in me!

305
00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.440
Fire!

306
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:54.369
Advance a bit farther. tether the horses.

307
00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:55.780
and switch to Maneuver Gear.

308
00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:58.320
You guys will be off on
your own for a while.

309
00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:00.430
Eldo. lead the squad.

310
00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:05.179
Once you're a good distance away
from the Titan. hide Eren.

311
00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.500
Take my horse.

312
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.670
He can't intend

313
00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.950
to take that Titan alive?

314
00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.839
Well. Eren? See that?

315
00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.980
We caught that Titan!

316
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:28.439
This is the power of the Survey Corps!

317
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.060
Don't underestimate us. fool.

318
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.080
Well? Do you get it now?

319
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:34.920
Yes!

320
00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:41.370
Looks like it's stopped moving...

321
00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.410
We can't lower our guard.

322
00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.640
But you did well. leading it here.

323
00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:53.960
Men in the rearguard squads died
buying us the time we needed.

324
00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.760
We couldn't have done it without them.

325
00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:58.550
Is that so?

326
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:00.060
It is.

327
00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:06.730
Thanks to them. we'll be able
to see who's inside this thing.

328
00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:12.290
I hope they haven't pissed themselves...

329
00:23:54.070 --> 00:24:00.260
Erwin Smith's secret plan was
to capture the Female Titan.

330
00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:05.679
The aces of the Survey Corps try
to reveal its true identity. but...

9999
00:00:0.500 --> 00:00:2.00
