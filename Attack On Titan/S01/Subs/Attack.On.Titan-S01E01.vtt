1
00:00:26.486 --> 00:00:30.240
Humanity was suddenly reminded that day...

2
00:00:36.246 --> 00:00:39.207
...of the terror of being at their mercy...

3
00:00:41.668 --> 00:00:46.589
...of the humiliation
of being trapped inside a cage...

4
00:01:04.858 --> 00:01:07.026
All soldiers. prepare for battle!

5
00:01:07.235 --> 00:01:08.695
We have one target!

6
00:01:08.903 --> 00:01:10.697
We will slay it and claim this spot

7
00:01:10.905 --> 00:01:13.199
as humanity's first stronghold
beyond the walls!

8
00:01:14.284 --> 00:01:15.368
Target approaching!

9
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.625
Split into five groups just as we practiced!

10
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.920
We'll act as the bait!

11
00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:28.757
All assault squads.
switch to omni-directional gear!

12
00:01:50.487 --> 00:01:52.614
Strike from all directions at once!

13
00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:00.413
Taste the power...

14
00:02:00.622 --> 00:02:02.165
...of humanity!

15
00:02:19.224 --> 00:02:24.062
Unknown are the names
of the flowers that have been trampled

16
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.526
Birds have fallen to the earth
and long for the wind

17
00:02:29.734 --> 00:02:34.614
Prayers won't solve anything

18
00:02:34.823 --> 00:02:39.953
Only the will to fight
can change the here and now!

19
00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:45.250
O pigs who laugh at the resolve
to walk over corpses to move forward

20
00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:47.794
Livestock complacency? False prosperity?

21
00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:50.672
Give us the freedom of dying.
starving wolves!

22
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.052
The humiliation of being caged
is what triggers us to fight back

23
00:02:56.261 --> 00:03:01.349
We hunters slaughter prey
beyond the castle walls.

24
00:03:01.558 --> 00:03:06.563
consumed with surging bloodlust.

25
00:03:06.771 --> 00:03:13.695
as our crimson bows and arrows
pierce scarlet holes into the twilight

26
00:04:07.957 --> 00:04:10.793
Huh? Mikasa...

27
00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:13.671
We should be getting back.

28
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.883
What are we doing here...?

29
00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:20.053
You were that deep asleep
that you're still only half-awake?

30
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:21.429
No...

31
00:04:21.638 --> 00:04:26.476
It just feels like I had this
really long dream or something...

32
00:04:27.769 --> 00:04:29.520
What was it about?

33
00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.648
I can't remember...

34
00:04:35.526 --> 00:04:38.029
Eren. Why are you crying?

35
00:04:38.237 --> 00:04:39.405
Huh?

36
00:04:49.123 --> 00:04:50.249
Listen!

37
00:04:50.458 --> 00:04:53.586
It was by God's great wisdom
that the walls were built!

38
00:04:53.795 --> 00:04:57.090
The walls are His divine work!

39
00:04:57.298 --> 00:05:01.052
No one must be allowed to defile the walls!

40
00:05:04.138 --> 00:05:08.184
Don't you dare tell anyone I was crying.

41
00:05:08.393 --> 00:05:10.103
I won't.

42
00:05:10.311 --> 00:05:13.773
Still. crying for no real reason...

43
00:05:13.982 --> 00:05:16.067
You should have your dad give you a checkup.

44
00:05:16.275 --> 00:05:19.779
Don't be stupid! I can't tell him!

45
00:05:19.988 --> 00:05:21.823
What are you cryin' about. Eren?

46
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.576
Mr. Hannes...

47
00:05:25.785 --> 00:05:28.037
Did Mikasa get on your case about somethin'?

48
00:05:28.246 --> 00:05:30.748
Huh?! What makes you think I was crying?!

49
00:05:30.957 --> 00:05:32.750
Whoa. you reek of alcohol!

50
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.086
It's like. come on. y'know?

51
00:05:35.294 --> 00:05:36.546
Oh.

52
00:05:36.754 --> 00:05:38.297
You're drinking again...

53
00:05:38.506 --> 00:05:40.133
You guys wanna join in?

54
00:05:40.341 --> 00:05:42.760
Actually. uhh... Don't you have work?

55
00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:45.471
Yup! We're guardin' the gate today!

56
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.810
We're stuck here all day.
so we end up getting hungry and thirsty.

57
00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:56.733
If some booze happens to get into our drinks.
so what? It's no big deal.

58
00:05:57.817 --> 00:06:00.611
What if something happens?!
Can you fight like that?!

59
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:04.699
- Whadya mean. "If something happens"?
- You know what I mean!

60
00:06:04.907 --> 00:06:07.952
I'm talking about if
they break the walls and get into the city!

61
00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:12.915
Oww...

62
00:06:13.124 --> 00:06:16.377
Geez. Eren. Don't go yellin' like that.

63
00:06:17.712 --> 00:06:20.548
You've got spunk. doctor's son!

64
00:06:20.757 --> 00:06:24.844
If they do bust down the walls.
we'll take care of business. don't you worry.

65
00:06:25.053 --> 00:06:29.140
But that ain't happened once
in the last one hundred years.

66
00:06:29.348 --> 00:06:34.687
Still. my dad says there's nothing
more dangerous than being complacent like that!

67
00:06:34.896 --> 00:06:36.814
Dr. Jaeger. huh?

68
00:06:37.023 --> 00:06:38.483
Yeah. he's got a point.

69
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:43.196
He once saved this town from an epidemic.

70
00:06:43.404 --> 00:06:45.740
I can't argue with him.

71
00:06:45.948 --> 00:06:48.826
Still. they're another story altogether.

72
00:06:50.328 --> 00:06:54.040
When you're a soldier. you get to see
those things roaming around outside

73
00:06:54.248 --> 00:06:56.793
while you're on
wall reinforcement duty and stuff.

74
00:06:57.001 --> 00:07:01.839
These walls are fifty meters tall. though.
I can't see 'em getting through.

75
00:07:02.048 --> 00:07:06.844
Then... you're not actually
prepared to fight them at all?!

76
00:07:07.053 --> 00:07:07.929
Nope!

77
00:07:08.137 --> 00:07:10.306
Wh-What?!

78
00:07:10.515 --> 00:07:13.059
Then drop the "Garrison Regiment" name

79
00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:15.061
for "Wall Construction Squad" instead!

80
00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:16.938
Not a bad idea!

81
00:07:18.272 --> 00:07:19.690
But you gotta understand. Eren.

82
00:07:19.899 --> 00:07:24.070
If a soldier's doing his job.
things have seriously gone to hell.

83
00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:28.741
It's better when everyone's
calling us useless freeloaders;

84
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.202
it means peaceful times for us all.

85
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.834
Sure. we can stay
inside the walls our entire lives

86
00:07:38.042 --> 00:07:40.795
and do nothing but eat and sleep!

87
00:07:41.003 --> 00:07:44.841
But... that basically...

88
00:07:45.049 --> 00:07:47.218
That basically makes us cattle!

89
00:07:50.513 --> 00:07:52.557
Man. you're one plucky kid. all right!

90
00:07:52.765 --> 00:07:56.185
For someone who's totally helpless!
Right. Hannes?!

91
00:07:56.394 --> 00:07:58.104
Huh? Y-Yeah.

92
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.566
Hey! Eren!

93
00:08:02.859 --> 00:08:05.278
What a weirdo!

94
00:08:05.486 --> 00:08:09.740
Wait... Don't tell me
he wants to join the Scout Regiment?

95
00:08:18.916 --> 00:08:22.753
Eren. I'd forget about
the Scout Regiment if I were you.

96
00:08:22.962 --> 00:08:26.340
What?! You think the Scout Regiment
is a joke too?!

97
00:08:26.549 --> 00:08:29.051
It's not about what I think.

98
00:08:35.892 --> 00:08:38.227
The Scout Regiment is back!

99
00:08:38.436 --> 00:08:39.979
They're gonna open the front gate!

100
00:08:40.188 --> 00:08:42.899
Let's go see the heroes return. Mikasa!

101
00:08:43.107 --> 00:08:44.066
Ohm!

102
00:08:55.578 --> 00:08:57.705
Damn! I can't see!

103
00:09:26.484 --> 00:09:29.362
They're the only ones who made it back?

104
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.031
Everyone else must've gotten eaten.

105
00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.368
This is what they get
for going outside the walls.

106
00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:37.912
Moses! Moses!

107
00:09:38.204 --> 00:09:39.664
Excuse me...

108
00:09:39.872 --> 00:09:42.375
I don't see my son Moses anywhere...

109
00:09:42.583 --> 00:09:44.585
Do you know where he is?

110
00:09:45.962 --> 00:09:48.130
This is Moses' mother.

111
00:09:48.339 --> 00:09:49.674
Go get it.

112
00:10:15.283 --> 00:10:18.494
It's all we could retrieve.

113
00:10:34.927 --> 00:10:36.887
But... my son...

114
00:10:37.096 --> 00:10:39.390
He was helpful. yes?

115
00:10:40.933 --> 00:10:44.145
Even if he didn't achieve direct greatness...

116
00:10:44.353 --> 00:10:49.734
...surely my son's death
helped humanity fight back. yes?!

117
00:10:56.157 --> 00:10:57.491
Of course...!

118
00:11:01.329 --> 00:11:03.205
No...

119
00:11:03.414 --> 00:11:06.751
On this latest scouting mission. we...

120
00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:08.085
No...

121
00:11:08.294 --> 00:11:11.922
Just like all the other missions...

122
00:11:12.131 --> 00:11:16.469
...we achieved nothing at all!

123
00:11:16.677 --> 00:11:19.013
My incompetence has done nothing

124
00:11:19.221 --> 00:11:21.891
but needlessly send soldiers to their deaths!

125
00:11:22.099 --> 00:11:28.731
We haven't found out anything about them!

126
00:11:34.653 --> 00:11:36.030
Talk about gruesome.

127
00:11:36.238 --> 00:11:38.032
You can say that again.

128
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.495
Our taxes are basically going
to feeding and fattening those things up now.

129
00:11:45.873 --> 00:11:47.708
What the hell. you little punk?!

130
00:11:50.044 --> 00:11:52.671
H-Hey! What are you doing. Mikasa?!

131
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.091
Hey! Get back here. you!

132
00:11:56.926 --> 00:11:59.762
Mikasa! Enough already!

133
00:12:05.017 --> 00:12:08.187
What's the big idea?!
Now the firewood's all over the place!

134
00:12:09.313 --> 00:12:10.856
Eren.

135
00:12:11.065 --> 00:12:14.527
Have you changed your mind
about joining the Scout Regiment?

136
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.162
Help pick this up.

137
00:12:26.288 --> 00:12:28.290
It's not that bad of a mess.

138
00:12:45.307 --> 00:12:46.809
We're home.

139
00:12:48.227 --> 00:12:49.728
Welcome back.

140
00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:56.652
Wow. Eren! You actually worked hard!

141
00:12:56.861 --> 00:12:58.154
Yeah...

142
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:02.741
What do you want?

143
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:06.203
Your ear's red. That shows that you're lying.

144
00:13:06.412 --> 00:13:08.831
You had Mikasa help you. didn't you?

145
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.668
Oh? You're leaving. Dad?

146
00:13:12.877 --> 00:13:13.711
Is it for work?

147
00:13:13.919 --> 00:13:16.422
Yes. Some checkups in the interior.

148
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.340
It'll take a couple of days.

149
00:13:21.552 --> 00:13:25.222
Eren says he wants to join the Scout Regiment.

150
00:13:29.143 --> 00:13:31.020
M-Mikasa! I told you not to say anything!

151
00:13:31.228 --> 00:13:32.521
Eren!

152
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.398
What are you thinking?!

153
00:13:34.607 --> 00:13:38.527
Do you have any idea how many people
have died outside the walls?!

154
00:13:38.736 --> 00:13:40.863
- Y-Yeah. I know!
- Then...!

155
00:13:41.071 --> 00:13:42.573
Eren.

156
00:13:43.699 --> 00:13:46.660
Why do you want to go out there?

157
00:13:47.953 --> 00:13:51.916
I want to know what the outside world is like!

158
00:13:52.124 --> 00:13:56.295
I don't want to live my entire life
in ignorance inside the walls!

159
00:13:56.504 --> 00:13:58.214
Plus...

160
00:13:58.422 --> 00:14:01.467
If no one else is willing to take their place.

161
00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:04.803
then the lives of all who've died
will be for nothing!

162
00:14:08.557 --> 00:14:10.017
I see.

163
00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:14.313
My boat's about to leave. I better get going.

164
00:14:14.522 --> 00:14:17.483
Hold on. dear! Talk some sense into Eren!

165
00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:18.776
Carla.

166
00:14:18.984 --> 00:14:24.365
Words can't hold back human curiosity.

167
00:14:24.573 --> 00:14:25.658
Eren.

168
00:14:26.992 --> 00:14:29.703
When I get back. I'll show you the basement

169
00:14:29.912 --> 00:14:32.414
that I've kept secret all this time.

170
00:14:32.623 --> 00:14:34.124
R-Really?!

171
00:14:37.962 --> 00:14:39.838
Take care!

172
00:14:42.091 --> 00:14:44.468
Just forget it.

173
00:14:44.677 --> 00:14:46.220
Joining the Scout Regiment is a stupid idea!

174
00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:48.389
Huh?! Stupid?!

175
00:14:48.597 --> 00:14:53.602
People who don't mind living like livestock
are the stupid ones. if you ask me!

176
00:14:53.811 --> 00:14:55.020
Eren!

177
00:14:58.107 --> 00:14:59.275
Mikasa.

178
00:14:59.483 --> 00:15:02.111
He gets himself into trouble so easily.

179
00:15:02.319 --> 00:15:05.030
If anything ever happens.
you need to be there for each other!

180
00:15:05.239 --> 00:15:06.532
Mm.

181
00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:11.996
What's the matter. heretic?!

182
00:15:12.204 --> 00:15:14.873
If you don't like it. let's see you hit back!

183
00:15:15.833 --> 00:15:17.501
Y-Yeah. right!

184
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:19.837
That would be stooping to your level!

185
00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:21.088
Say what?!

186
00:15:21.297 --> 00:15:24.466
You know I'm right!

187
00:15:24.675 --> 00:15:27.970
That's why you have to resort to violence!
Because you can't argue back!

188
00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:31.390
Which means you
concede defeat to me. does it not?!

189
00:15:32.808 --> 00:15:35.060
Shut up. smart-ass!

190
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:36.353
Stop that!

191
00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:39.648
It's Eren!

192
00:15:39.857 --> 00:15:42.735
- That Idiot's back for more?!
- Does he want his ass kicked?!

193
00:15:42.943 --> 00:15:44.570
We'll tear you a new one!

194
00:15:45.863 --> 00:15:48.073
M-Mikasa's with him!

195
00:15:48.282 --> 00:15:50.868
S-Screw this! Let's get outta here!

196
00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:59.001
One look at me and they ran off!

197
00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:01.754
No. it was Mikasa they saw...

198
00:16:01.962 --> 00:16:03.172
Oww!

199
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.382
Hey! You Okay. Armin?!

200
00:16:09.595 --> 00:16:11.805
I can get up on my own...

201
00:16:12.014 --> 00:16:13.390
Oh.

202
00:16:16.352 --> 00:16:21.190
I said humanity needs to venture
into the outside world at some point...

203
00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:23.525
...and then they beat me up
and called me a heretic.

204
00:16:23.734 --> 00:16:25.027
Damn...

205
00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:30.491
Why does everyone look down on people
just for wanting to go outside?!

206
00:16:30.699 --> 00:16:33.535
Well. because we've had
a hundred years of peace

207
00:16:33.744 --> 00:16:35.954
by staying inside the walls.

208
00:16:36.163 --> 00:16:38.207
They're worried that going outside carelessly

209
00:16:38.415 --> 00:16:41.210
will invite them inside the walls.

210
00:16:41.418 --> 00:16:43.420
The royal government's policies have made

211
00:16:43.629 --> 00:16:47.424
having any interest
in the outside world a taboo.

212
00:16:47.633 --> 00:16:50.761
It's our lives! We can risk 'em if we want!

213
00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:52.513
Absolutely not.

214
00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.599
Forget about it.

215
00:16:55.808 --> 00:16:58.560
Which reminds me.
I can't believe you told my parents!

216
00:16:58.769 --> 00:16:59.561
Huh?

217
00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:01.271
I never agreed to help.

218
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.273
So. what did they say?

219
00:17:03.482 --> 00:17:06.735
They're... less than pleased.

220
00:17:08.153 --> 00:17:09.488
It figures.

221
00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:16.161
Indeed. I think people are crazy

222
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:20.457
if they think we'll be
safe inside these walls forever.

223
00:17:20.666 --> 00:17:21.834
Mommy!

224
00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:27.798
Just because the walls
haven't fallen for a hundred years

225
00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:30.718
doesn't guarantee that they won't fall today...

226
00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:34.054
And yet...

227
00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:54.450
Wh-What was that?!

228
00:17:54.658 --> 00:17:55.868
An explosion?!

229
00:17:56.827 --> 00:17:58.245
- That way!
- Did something fall?!

230
00:17:58.454 --> 00:18:00.706
I'm not really sure...

231
00:18:01.832 --> 00:18:03.417
Hey. Armin!

232
00:18:07.004 --> 00:18:10.841
What is it?! What do you see?!

233
00:18:20.434 --> 00:18:21.852
It can't be...!

234
00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:26.607
Th-That wall... is fifty meters high!

235
00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:29.526
It's one of them...

236
00:18:34.948 --> 00:18:36.325
A Titan!

237
00:19:21.912 --> 00:19:26.792
L-it... opened a hole in the wall...

238
00:19:31.839 --> 00:19:33.006
They're inside!

239
00:19:33.215 --> 00:19:35.676
The Titans have gotten inside!

240
00:19:39.263 --> 00:19:41.014
We need to run too!

241
00:19:41.223 --> 00:19:42.099
Eren!

242
00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:44.184
My house is in that direction!

243
00:19:44.393 --> 00:19:45.435
Mom...!

244
00:19:46.645 --> 00:19:47.688
Mikasa!

245
00:19:53.861 --> 00:19:56.113
It's all over...

246
00:19:56.321 --> 00:20:02.619
Countless Titans... are going to overrun the city!

247
00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:10.210
It couldn't have hit our home!

248
00:20:10.419 --> 00:20:13.714
Just around this corner...
our house is standing there. like always!

249
00:20:18.302 --> 00:20:19.595
Mom!

250
00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:23.348
Mom!

251
00:20:25.183 --> 00:20:27.561
- Eren!
- Mikasa! Grab that end!

252
00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:29.271
We gotta move this pillar!

253
00:20:48.165 --> 00:20:49.166
Hurry. Mikasa!

254
00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:51.126
I know!

255
00:20:51.335 --> 00:20:54.379
The Titans have gotten inside. haven't they?

256
00:20:54.588 --> 00:20:56.757
Eren! Take Mikasa and run away!

257
00:20:56.965 --> 00:20:58.133
Hurry!

258
00:20:58.342 --> 00:20:59.968
I want to!

259
00:21:00.177 --> 00:21:02.512
So hurry and get out of there!

260
00:21:02.721 --> 00:21:06.141
The debris has crushed my legs...

261
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.978
Even if I could get out.
I wouldn't be able to run.

262
00:21:10.187 --> 00:21:10.979
You understand what that means.

263
00:21:11.188 --> 00:21:12.940
I'll carry you. then!

264
00:21:13.148 --> 00:21:16.276
Why don't you ever listen to your mother?!

265
00:21:16.485 --> 00:21:19.196
You can at least do this one last thing!

266
00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:20.572
Mikasa!

267
00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:23.075
No...

268
00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:24.910
No...!

269
00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:27.204
If you don't go. all three of us will...

270
00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:30.207
Hannes!

271
00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:34.461
Take the children and get out of here!

272
00:21:35.671 --> 00:21:38.423
Don't go underestimatin' me. Carla.

273
00:21:38.632 --> 00:21:42.886
I'm gonna slaughter these Titans
and save all three of ya!

274
00:21:43.095 --> 00:21:45.597
Wait! Don't fight them!

275
00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:48.850
Yeah. I could save those two for sure.

276
00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:50.310
But now...

277
00:21:50.519 --> 00:21:53.021
I'm finally going to repay the favor I owe!

278
00:22:09.496 --> 00:22:11.331
Hey! Mr. Hannes!

279
00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.458
What are you doing?!

280
00:22:14.459 --> 00:22:16.169
- Thank you...
- Hey!

281
00:22:16.378 --> 00:22:19.089
Mom's still...!

282
00:22:19.297 --> 00:22:22.050
Eren! Mikasa!

283
00:22:22.259 --> 00:22:24.636
You have to survive!

284
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:39.192
Don't go...

285
00:22:49.411 --> 00:22:53.123
Stop!

286
00:23:26.406 --> 00:23:30.285
Humanity was suddenly reminded that day...

287
00:23:34.873 --> 00:23:38.001
...of the terror of being at their mercy...

288
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:45.342
...of the humiliation
of being trapped inside a cage...

289
00:24:10.534 --> 00:24:15.247
Your dreams are where your heart is

290
00:24:15.455 --> 00:24:21.503
They're more fragile than life itself

291
00:24:21.711 --> 00:24:26.216
Over and over you cast them aside.
only to find more

292
00:24:26.424 --> 00:24:32.931
Now. rest in peace

293
00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:44.025
Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for

294
00:24:44.234 --> 00:24:54.536
and the more we forget
the more we remember again

295
00:24:54.744 --> 00:25:00.500
In this beautiful. cruel world

296
00:25:00.709 --> 00:25:05.797
all I can do is ask why we're still alive

297
00:25:06.006 --> 00:25:11.428
Oh. with our strength... and our weakness...

298
00:25:11.636 --> 00:25:16.975
what are we going to protect if there's no sense

299
00:25:17.184 --> 00:25:21.771
to anything anymore?

300
00:25:27.861 --> 00:25:29.946
Shiganshina falls.

301
00:25:30.155 --> 00:25:35.493
Prayers. screams. and death
are all that humanity is allowed.

302
00:25:35.702 --> 00:25:40.790
Amid this. Eren alone
swears revenge in his small heart.

9999
00:00:0.500 --> 00:00:2.00
