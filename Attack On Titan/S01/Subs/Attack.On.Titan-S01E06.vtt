<i>Unknown are the names
of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

2
00:00:21.356 --> 00:00:26.611
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth
and long for the wind</i>

3
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.700
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

4
00:00:31.908 --> 00:00:37.038
<i>Only the will to fight
can change the here and now!</i>

5
00:00:37.247 --> 00:00:42.335
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve
to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

6
00:00:42.544 --> 00:00:44.879
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

7
00:00:45.088 --> 00:00:47.757
<i>Give us the freedom of dying.
starving wolves!</i>

8
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:53.138
<i>The humiliation of being caged
is what triggers us to fight back</i>

9
00:00:53.346 --> 00:00:58.435
<i>We hunters slaughter prey
beyond the castle walls.</i>

10
00:00:58.643 --> 00:01:03.648
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust.</i>

11
00:01:03.857 --> 00:01:10.780
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows
pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

12
00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:39.684
Hey!

13
00:01:39.893 --> 00:01:41.519
Hey! What's wrong. Armin?!

14
00:01:41.728 --> 00:01:42.687
Pull yourself together!

15
00:01:42.896 --> 00:01:43.813
Hey!

16
00:01:44.022 --> 00:01:46.357
Armin! Hey. Armin!

17
00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:47.984
Hey!

18
00:01:48.735 --> 00:01:51.196
You with me?! You okay?!

19
00:01:51.404 --> 00:01:54.365
Are you all right? Where's your squad?

20
00:01:54.574 --> 00:01:56.075
Squad...?

21
00:01:56.284 --> 00:01:57.952
Oh. man. Pull yourself together.

22
00:01:58.161 --> 00:01:59.829
Why are you all by yourself?

23
00:02:00.038 --> 00:02:02.832
Plus you're all wet and slimy...

24
00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:05.168
What the hell happened?

25
00:02:10.548 --> 00:02:13.259
You're so useless! Just die already!

26
00:02:13.468 --> 00:02:15.553
- Whoa! Calm down. Armin!
- Damn it!

27
00:02:15.762 --> 00:02:17.597
Where is everyone?!

28
00:02:18.097 --> 00:02:20.141
Give it a rest. Conny.

29
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.311
They've been wiped out. All but him.

30
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.105
Shut up! Armin hasn't said anything!

31
00:02:26.314 --> 00:02:28.149
Just look around. It's obvious.

32
00:02:28.358 --> 00:02:31.319
We don't got any
more time to waste on him.

33
00:02:31.528 --> 00:02:33.571
Why is he the only one who's okay?!

34
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.242
Beats me. Maybe they
thought he was a corpse?

35
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.537
It sucks that they
ran into multiple Titans

36
00:02:40.745 --> 00:02:42.956
and that only this
underachiever made it out alive.

37
00:02:43.164 --> 00:02:45.124
Eren and the others
worked hard for nothing.

38
00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:47.335
You bitch...

39
00:02:47.544 --> 00:02:49.796
Want me to make it
so you never talk again?!

40
00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:51.381
Stop it. you two!

41
00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:54.008
We're <i>all</i> shaken up here!

42
00:02:54.217 --> 00:02:56.886
All our friends are suddenly
dying left and right!

43
00:02:57.095 --> 00:02:58.346
It's natural we're upset!

44
00:02:58.555 --> 00:03:04.102
That's my Christa!
Marry me when this is over!

45
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.728
Yeah...

46
00:03:06.271 --> 00:03:08.731
She is clowning
around more than usual.

47
00:03:09.482 --> 00:03:11.317
Anyways. we can't stay here.

48
00:03:11.526 --> 00:03:13.570
Can you stand. Armin?!

49
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.034
I'm sorry for the trouble.

50
00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:23.037
I'll rendezvous with the rearguard.

51
00:03:23.246 --> 00:03:23.955
Hey...

52
00:03:24.163 --> 00:03:25.582
Armin!

53
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.047
Let's go. Conny!
We've been ordered to advance!

54
00:03:37.468 --> 00:03:39.345
This is hell...

55
00:03:39.554 --> 00:03:43.766
No. it hasn't become hell.

56
00:03:43.975 --> 00:03:47.270
I was just mistaken until now.

57
00:03:47.478 --> 00:03:51.608
This world has always been hell.
from the very start.

58
00:03:53.484 --> 00:03:56.613
The strong prey on the weak.

59
00:03:56.821 --> 00:03:59.991
It's such a simple.
straightforward world.

60
00:04:01.034 --> 00:04:03.995
It's just. my friends...

61
00:04:06.831 --> 00:04:11.127
They tried to be strong in this world.

62
00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.549
They helped me. someone who was weak.

63
00:04:16.758 --> 00:04:20.136
I couldn't bear it...

64
00:04:20.345 --> 00:04:24.682
They saw me as someone
who needed to be protected.

65
00:04:24.891 --> 00:04:27.060
I wanted to live
in this world like them...

66
00:04:27.268 --> 00:04:33.399
I wanted to be strong and stand
shoulder-to-shoulder with them...

67
00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.285
And <i>this</i> is the result.

68
00:04:44.494 --> 00:04:47.413
Because of me. Eren wound up...

69
00:04:59.258 --> 00:05:00.385
Hanna...

70
00:05:00.593 --> 00:05:02.637
What are you doing?

71
00:05:02.845 --> 00:05:03.930
Armin! Help!

72
00:05:04.138 --> 00:05:06.599
Franz isn't breathing!

73
00:05:06.808 --> 00:05:12.355
I've tried resuscitating him
over and over and over...

74
00:05:13.064 --> 00:05:14.899
...but it's not working!

75
00:05:15.108 --> 00:05:17.402
It's dangerous down here. Hanna.

76
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.489
- You need to get on a roof...
- I can't just leave Franz like this!

77
00:05:21.698 --> 00:05:24.742
You don't understand. Hanna...

78
00:05:24.951 --> 00:05:26.577
Franz is...

79
00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:37.755
Please... stop this...

80
00:05:38.506 --> 00:05:39.716
I...

81
00:05:41.843 --> 00:05:45.096
I can't take this anymore...

82
00:05:45.304 --> 00:05:47.015
I can't...

83
00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:57.150
H-Hey. now! Don't you guys
realize how bad the situation is?!

84
00:05:57.358 --> 00:05:59.819
Yeah! That's why we're doin' this!

85
00:06:00.028 --> 00:06:02.280
And if you guys wanna live.
you'll give us some damn help!

86
00:06:02.488 --> 00:06:04.282
- The hell with that!
- It's gonna get stuck!

87
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.493
- Letting people through comes first!
- We're all gonna get eaten standing here!

88
00:06:07.702 --> 00:06:10.955
- What are you doing. soldier?!
- Go get 'em!

89
00:06:11.164 --> 00:06:12.540
B-But...

90
00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:17.128
Just try it. small fry! I'm the boss
of this town's merchant association!

91
00:06:17.336 --> 00:06:19.255
Uhh. err...

92
00:06:19.464 --> 00:06:23.593
Who do you think pays for
the meals you soldiers shit out?!

93
00:06:23.801 --> 00:06:27.263
Do you have the money to
provide for the soldiers in this town?!

94
00:06:27.472 --> 00:06:28.931
Push. all of you!

95
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:34.187
This cargo's worth more than you
can earn in your entire measly lives!

96
00:06:34.395 --> 00:06:36.814
Help. and you'll be rewarded!

97
00:06:37.023 --> 00:06:38.357
It'll be okay.

98
00:06:38.566 --> 00:06:42.695
Your dad's going to use his
cannons to make the Titans go away.

99
00:06:42.904 --> 00:06:44.614
Mom.

100
00:06:44.822 --> 00:06:46.449
Over there.

101
00:06:57.168 --> 00:06:58.377
Push!

102
00:06:58.586 --> 00:07:00.463
Push if you don't wanna die!

103
00:07:00.671 --> 00:07:02.298
Stop! The children...!

104
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.722
Damn! Why is it ignoring us?!

105
00:07:09.931 --> 00:07:12.391
It's an Abnormal!
No point trying to figure it out!

106
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.812
It's fast! Not even we
elites can catch up to it!

107
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.855
At this rate...!

108
00:07:37.834 --> 00:07:40.461
What... are you doing?

109
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.547
Oh. perfect timing!

110
00:07:42.755 --> 00:07:45.383
Get these guys to help me!

111
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:48.010
I'll make it worth your while!

112
00:07:49.887 --> 00:07:53.683
My comrades are dying as we speak.

113
00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:59.564
They're fighting and dying because
the citizens haven't finished evacuating.

114
00:07:59.772 --> 00:08:01.065
Of course they are!

115
00:08:01.274 --> 00:08:03.401
It's your duty to give your hearts

116
00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:06.445
to defend the lives
and property of the people!

117
00:08:06.654 --> 00:08:09.365
Don't go gettin' a big head now
that you freeloaders have somethin' to do

118
00:08:09.574 --> 00:08:11.409
after a century of uselessness!

119
00:08:20.084 --> 00:08:23.754
If you feel people dying for
other people is a matter of course.

120
00:08:23.963 --> 00:08:29.552
then I'm sure you'll understand
that a single. precious life

121
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.180
can sometimes save
the lives of many as well.

122
00:08:32.388 --> 00:08:33.806
Just you try it!

123
00:08:34.015 --> 00:08:36.517
Your employer and I go way back!

124
00:08:36.726 --> 00:08:41.731
One word from me and
he'll be all over your sorry ass!

125
00:08:45.484 --> 00:08:47.486
How can a dead body talk?

126
00:08:50.323 --> 00:08:51.741
Wait!

127
00:08:55.536 --> 00:08:58.206
S-Sir!

128
00:08:58.414 --> 00:09:00.249
Pull the cart out.

129
00:09:09.175 --> 00:09:11.385
Thanks. lady!

130
00:09:11.594 --> 00:09:15.765
You really saved the day.
You have our gratitude!

131
00:09:41.374 --> 00:09:44.627
Good work taking it down.
Ackermann. Very impressive.

132
00:09:44.835 --> 00:09:48.005
Thank you. Sir. However...

133
00:09:48.214 --> 00:09:52.510
I'm afraid I inadvertently dulled
my blades during the attack.

134
00:09:52.718 --> 00:09:54.929
I will be more careful next time.

135
00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:59.350
Just what have
you had to live through...?

136
00:09:59.558 --> 00:10:01.560
No. never mind.

137
00:10:07.483 --> 00:10:10.987
Why am I reminded
of it at a time like this?

138
00:10:29.505 --> 00:10:31.132
Finished!

139
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.883
Look. Mom!

140
00:10:33.092 --> 00:10:35.928
Oh. you did a great job. Mikasa!

141
00:10:36.137 --> 00:10:37.972
It's very nice!

142
00:10:39.015 --> 00:10:41.225
This style of embroidery has
been passed down in our clan

143
00:10:41.434 --> 00:10:43.769
from generation to generation.

144
00:10:43.978 --> 00:10:47.315
When you have a child.
it'll be your turn to pass it on too!

145
00:10:48.566 --> 00:10:50.443
How can I have a child?

146
00:10:50.651 --> 00:10:54.113
Err. why don't you ask your father that?

147
00:10:54.322 --> 00:10:55.614
Well. Dad?

148
00:10:55.823 --> 00:10:58.784
Oh. uhh. I don't really know. either!

149
00:10:58.993 --> 00:11:01.704
Oh. I know!
Dr. Jaeger will be here any minute!

150
00:11:01.912 --> 00:11:04.248
Why don't we ask him?

151
00:11:06.876 --> 00:11:09.837
Oh. that must be him!

152
00:11:12.381 --> 00:11:13.799
Coming!

153
00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:19.972
Mikasa?

154
00:11:20.181 --> 00:11:23.809
Yes. She's about your age.

155
00:11:24.018 --> 00:11:28.147
There aren't many children
in these parts. so try to get along.

156
00:11:28.356 --> 00:11:30.858
That depends on how she acts...

157
00:11:31.067 --> 00:11:32.360
Eren.

158
00:11:32.568 --> 00:11:35.863
That attitude is why
you've only made one friend.

159
00:11:37.365 --> 00:11:38.949
Are they not home?

160
00:11:40.034 --> 00:11:41.118
Mr. Ackermann!

161
00:11:41.327 --> 00:11:43.162
It's Jaeger!

162
00:11:45.498 --> 00:11:47.333
Is anyone home?

163
00:11:49.627 --> 00:11:51.128
What's wrong?

164
00:11:52.588 --> 00:11:54.548
What is it. Dad?

165
00:12:03.015 --> 00:12:04.308
Too late.

166
00:12:04.517 --> 00:12:05.601
Eren.

167
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:10.106
Have you seen the girl..
Mikasa... anywhere nearby?

168
00:12:10.314 --> 00:12:11.649
No.

169
00:12:11.857 --> 00:12:13.275
I see...

170
00:12:14.485 --> 00:12:17.655
I'll get the Military Police
and have them conduct a search!

171
00:12:17.863 --> 00:12:19.698
You'll wait at the foot of the mountain.

172
00:12:19.907 --> 00:12:22.410
Is that clear. Eren?!

173
00:12:23.536 --> 00:12:24.954
Eren!

174
00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:35.881
Hey. Are you sure she'll actually sell?

175
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:39.009
We even went and killed her
parents before running off with her...

176
00:12:39.218 --> 00:12:42.138
Take a look at her face.

177
00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:48.060
Looks nice. but she's
still just a kid. She ain't for me.

178
00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:50.855
I'm not asking about your tastes.

179
00:12:51.063 --> 00:12:53.107
She's an "Oriental."

180
00:12:53.315 --> 00:12:56.485
There used to be different types
of humans. you see.

181
00:12:56.694 --> 00:12:59.029
Long ago. some people
fled a place called the Orient

182
00:12:59.238 --> 00:13:01.031
and sought refuge inside the walls.

183
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.784
She's the last descendant of that clan.

184
00:13:03.993 --> 00:13:06.537
We're gonna take her to the
underground market in the capital

185
00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:09.540
and auction her off to those old perverts.

186
00:13:09.748 --> 00:13:13.878
All the other Orientals have died out.
so she'll go for a pretty hefty price.

187
00:13:14.086 --> 00:13:17.423
Her old man didn't
look like an Oriental to me.

188
00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:19.383
She ain't pureblooded.

189
00:13:20.593 --> 00:13:23.762
That's right! The mom
was the really valuable one!

190
00:13:23.971 --> 00:13:25.598
But you had to freak out and kill her!

191
00:13:25.806 --> 00:13:28.642
I-I couldn't help it! She put up a fight!

192
00:13:28.851 --> 00:13:31.604
That all you got
to say for yourself?! Huh?!

193
00:13:37.109 --> 00:13:37.985
Dr. Jaeger!

194
00:13:38.194 --> 00:13:40.029
We've been expecting...

195
00:13:52.833 --> 00:13:54.835
Hello. Pardon the intrusion.

196
00:14:00.925 --> 00:14:02.843
Just take it nice and easy.

197
00:14:03.052 --> 00:14:06.430
unless you want
your head split open with this.

198
00:14:08.516 --> 00:14:09.725
This broad's crazy!

199
00:14:09.934 --> 00:14:11.435
Mikasa! Run!

200
00:14:11.644 --> 00:14:13.103
Huh? M-Mom...

201
00:14:13.312 --> 00:14:15.231
Hurry. Mikasa!

202
00:14:16.148 --> 00:14:18.150
Uhh...

203
00:14:18.359 --> 00:14:19.401
Dad...?

204
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:22.696
Damn it! I've had enough of your crap!

205
00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:38.420
What the hell?!
I said only kill the dad!

206
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:40.798
Don't look at me!
She's the one who...!

207
00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:43.217
Save your excuses! Go get the kid!

208
00:14:43.425 --> 00:14:44.843
Huh?!

209
00:14:47.555 --> 00:14:48.389
Hey.

210
00:14:48.597 --> 00:14:50.891
<i>You</i> better behave yourself.

211
00:14:52.184 --> 00:14:54.979
Or else... this!

212
00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:07.449
Cold...

213
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.462
Excuse me...

214
00:15:21.297 --> 00:15:22.715
Hold it. kid!

215
00:15:22.923 --> 00:15:25.050
How did you find this place?!

216
00:15:25.259 --> 00:15:26.844
Err. uhh...

217
00:15:27.052 --> 00:15:32.308
I got lost in the forest.
and then. umm. I saw a cabin. so...

218
00:15:37.021 --> 00:15:41.567
You know kids shouldn't
wander around the forest all alone.

219
00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:45.321
Scary wolves live
in the forest. you know.

220
00:15:45.529 --> 00:15:47.948
But there's nothing to
worry about now.

221
00:15:48.157 --> 00:15:50.659
We'll be happy to take you...

222
00:15:52.369 --> 00:15:54.455
Thanks. Mister.

223
00:15:54.663 --> 00:15:56.957
I already know the score.

224
00:15:57.916 --> 00:16:00.919
So die. you asshole!

225
00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:06.842
Huh?! What the hell?!

226
00:16:07.051 --> 00:16:10.095
G-Get back here. kid!

227
00:16:16.226 --> 00:16:18.604
You damn animal...!

228
00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:21.106
Die! Die!

229
00:16:21.315 --> 00:16:25.903
This is what you get!
This is what you deserve!

230
00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:29.490
Never get up again!

231
00:16:44.338 --> 00:16:48.842
You're safe now...
You can relax.

232
00:16:51.637 --> 00:16:54.056
I take it you're Mikasa?

233
00:16:54.264 --> 00:16:55.557
I'm Eren.

234
00:16:55.766 --> 00:17:00.896
I'm Dr. Jaeger's son.
I'm sure you've met my dad before.

235
00:17:01.105 --> 00:17:04.274
I was tagging along when he
visited your house for a checkup.

236
00:17:04.483 --> 00:17:06.110
But then...

237
00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:10.948
There were three of them.

238
00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.584
Was it you?

239
00:17:25.796 --> 00:17:27.172
Was it you who killed 'em?!

240
00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:28.966
Was it?!

241
00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:32.886
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna kill you!

242
00:17:33.095 --> 00:17:35.806
F-Fight!

243
00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:37.850
Fight!

244
00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:41.645
Fight... or die...!

245
00:17:41.854 --> 00:17:44.064
Win... and live!

246
00:17:44.273 --> 00:17:47.276
What the hell are you thinking. brat?!

247
00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:51.029
The only way to win...
is to fight!

248
00:17:56.535 --> 00:17:58.829
No... I can't do it!

249
00:18:07.546 --> 00:18:11.425
Just then... I remembered.

250
00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:14.303
I had seen this same thing...

251
00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:17.431
...over and over...

252
00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:19.516
...all my life.

253
00:18:21.393 --> 00:18:25.397
I'd seen it everywhere I went...

254
00:18:25.606 --> 00:18:27.024
But...

255
00:18:27.858 --> 00:18:30.569
I always looked the other way.

256
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.448
"That's right...

257
00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:37.993
We live...

258
00:18:39.828 --> 00:18:41.830
...in a cruel world."

259
00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:54.384
At that moment.
my body stopped shaking.

260
00:18:54.593 --> 00:18:59.515
I was in full control of
myself after that.

261
00:19:01.058 --> 00:19:03.769
I thought I could do anything...

262
00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:05.395
"Fight."

263
00:19:10.192 --> 00:19:11.610
"Fight!"

264
00:19:12.486 --> 00:19:13.904
"Fight!"

265
00:19:24.498 --> 00:19:27.709
Stabbed through the heart from behind.

266
00:19:27.918 --> 00:19:30.629
Those <i>kids</i> did this?

267
00:19:35.676 --> 00:19:39.304
Eren. I told you to wait
at the foot of the mountain.

268
00:19:39.513 --> 00:19:42.766
Do you have any idea what you've done?!

269
00:19:42.975 --> 00:19:45.269
I got rid of some dangerous animals!

270
00:19:45.477 --> 00:19:48.230
They just happened to look like people!

271
00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:49.690
Eren!

272
00:19:49.898 --> 00:19:53.944
They would've been long gone
by the time the Military Police arrived!

273
00:19:54.152 --> 00:19:55.571
It would've been too late!

274
00:19:55.779 --> 00:20:00.534
Even so. you were just lucky. Eren!

275
00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:05.873
The way you casually threw
your life away is what I'm angry about!

276
00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:07.958
But...

277
00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:11.378
I wanted to save her as fast as I could...

278
00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:18.552
Mikasa. Do you remember me?

279
00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.180
We've met several times before.
when you were little.

280
00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:26.727
Dr. Jaeger...

281
00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:32.149
How do I get home from here?

282
00:20:33.775 --> 00:20:36.111
I'm cold...

283
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.116
I have nowhere to go now...

284
00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:53.795
You can keep this.

285
00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:59.343
Warm. isn't it?

286
00:21:05.182 --> 00:21:07.643
It is...

287
00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:08.977
Mikasa.

288
00:21:09.186 --> 00:21:11.313
Come live with us.

289
00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:13.065
Huh?

290
00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:16.443
You've been through a lot.

291
00:21:16.652 --> 00:21:20.113
You need plenty of rest.

292
00:21:22.199 --> 00:21:23.742
What is it?

293
00:21:23.951 --> 00:21:27.204
C'mon. Let's go already.

294
00:21:27.412 --> 00:21:29.373
To our home.

295
00:21:33.585 --> 00:21:35.420
Yeah. Let's go...

296
00:21:50.435 --> 00:21:55.273
A cruel world in which only
the victors are allowed to live...

297
00:21:59.945 --> 00:22:01.113
Time to withdraw. Ackermann!

298
00:22:01.321 --> 00:22:02.656
Let's scale the wall!

299
00:22:02.864 --> 00:22:04.908
I'll go assist the vanguard's retreat!

300
00:22:05.117 --> 00:22:07.202
H-Hey. Ackermann!

301
00:22:07.411 --> 00:22:11.999
But I do have a place to
call home in this world now.

302
00:22:13.959 --> 00:22:15.210
Eren.

303
00:22:15.419 --> 00:22:19.423
As long as I have you.
I can do anything.

304
00:22:37.482 --> 00:22:42.404
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

305
00:22:42.612 --> 00:22:48.660
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

306
00:22:48.869 --> 00:22:53.331
<i>Over and over you cast them aside.
only to find more</i>

307
00:22:53.540 --> 00:23:00.005
<i>Now. rest in peace</i>

308
00:23:00.213 --> 00:23:11.349
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

309
00:23:11.558 --> 00:23:21.610
<i>and the more we forget
the more we remember again</i>

310
00:23:21.818 --> 00:23:27.574
<i>In this beautiful. cruel world</i>

311
00:23:27.783 --> 00:23:32.746
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

312
00:23:32.954 --> 00:23:38.460
<i>Oh. with our strength... and our weakness...</i>

313
00:23:38.668 --> 00:23:44.132
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

314
00:23:44.341 --> 00:23:47.761
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

315
00:23:54.935 --> 00:23:58.480
"I have a place to call home."

316
00:23:58.688 --> 00:24:02.943
After finishing her rearguard duties.
Mikasa hurries to see Eren.

317
00:24:03.151 --> 00:24:07.155
only to learn of his death.
