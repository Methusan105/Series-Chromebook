00:00:02.253 --> 00:00:08.760
Over a century ago. beings that
prey on humans suddenly appeared.

2
00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:15.225
Their absolutely overwhelming strength

3
00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:19.938
quickly pushed humanity to
the brink of extinction.

4
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.196
The surviving humans constructed
three walls: Maria. Rose. and Sina.

5
00:00:28.405 --> 00:00:31.741
which brought them a century of peace.

6
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.368
However...

7
00:00:49.342 --> 00:00:54.180
<i>Unknown are the names
of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

8
00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:59.644
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth
and long for the wind</i>

9
00:00:59.853 --> 00:01:04.733
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

10
00:01:04.941 --> 00:01:10.071
<i>Only the will to fight
can change the here and now!</i>

11
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.368
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve
to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

12
00:01:15.577 --> 00:01:17.912
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

13
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:20.790
<i>Give us the freedom of dying.
starving wolves!</i>

14
00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:26.171
<i>The humiliation of being caged
is what triggers us to fight back</i>

15
00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:31.468
<i>We hunters slaughter prey
beyond the castle walls.</i>

16
00:01:31.676 --> 00:01:36.681
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust.</i>

17
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.813
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows
pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

18
00:02:12.634 --> 00:02:18.306
The Titan assault on Trost District
resulted in heavy soldier casualties.

19
00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:22.894
owing. in part. to the fact that the elite
Scout Regiment was absent at the time.

20
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.943
They had just left that morning
on an exterior scouting mission.

21
00:02:32.612 --> 00:02:36.533
It's here! The main unit
of the Scout Regiment!

22
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:40.829
Commander Erwin!
Give those Titans a real thrashing!

23
00:02:41.037 --> 00:02:43.581
Look! It's Captain Levi!

24
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.876
They say he's as mighty
as an entire brigade!

25
00:02:47.085 --> 00:02:49.671
Ugh. Talk about annoying...

26
00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:56.469
If their looks of envy catch sight
of how fussy you are. it'll crush them.

27
00:03:01.891 --> 00:03:05.436
Outside await the Titans...!

28
00:03:05.645 --> 00:03:08.940
I wonder what kind we'll see this time!

29
00:03:09.148 --> 00:03:13.570
I hope we find some
Abnormals! That'd be great!

30
00:03:13.778 --> 00:03:16.072
I'd say there's already an
Abnormal right here.

31
00:03:16.281 --> 00:03:18.449
Huh?! Where?!

32
00:03:19.868 --> 00:03:21.286
Here.

33
00:03:21.494 --> 00:03:22.912
Move out!

34
00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:29.961
Exterior scouting and establishing
bases for expansion...

35
00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.755
Entrusted with these duties.

36
00:03:32.964 --> 00:03:36.009
the Scout Regiment stands at
the apex of humankind's knowledge.

37
00:03:36.217 --> 00:03:38.177
Survival rates
have increased dramatically

38
00:03:38.386 --> 00:03:41.639
thanks to the resourcefulness
of some members.

39
00:03:41.848 --> 00:03:46.060
but excursions into
Titan territory still always result

40
00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.939
in casualties exceeding 30%.

41
00:03:50.148 --> 00:03:56.613
That's simply how overwhelmingly powerful
the Titans are compared to humans.

42
00:03:56.821 --> 00:04:00.742
Just you watch...!

43
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.995
Humanity is...

44
00:04:04.203 --> 00:04:06.497
...going to destroy you all!

45
00:04:06.706 --> 00:04:08.541
The last ones standing...

46
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.585
...will be us!

47
00:04:15.548 --> 00:04:18.635
Just you wait...

48
00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:22.138
Captain Levi is gonna...!

49
00:04:35.234 --> 00:04:37.320
One on the right...

50
00:04:37.528 --> 00:04:38.988
Two on the left...

51
00:04:39.197 --> 00:04:41.866
Captain! I've gathered reinforcements!

52
00:04:42.075 --> 00:04:44.994
Petra. Tend to the soldier below.

53
00:04:45.203 --> 00:04:47.413
The rest of you. take the one on the right.

54
00:04:47.622 --> 00:04:49.916
I'll handle the ones on the left.

55
00:04:50.124 --> 00:04:51.751
Captain!

56
00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:58.341
Yahoo!

57
00:05:01.344 --> 00:05:03.179
It's okay!

58
00:05:03.388 --> 00:05:06.891
I won't hurt you! I promise!

59
00:05:10.687 --> 00:05:11.771
Nice try!

60
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.314
Now it's my turn!

61
00:05:13.523 --> 00:05:15.525
Hiyaah!

62
00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.655
See? That didn't hurt.

63
00:05:21.781 --> 00:05:24.075
Every single one of you...

64
00:05:27.578 --> 00:05:30.206
...looks as funny as hell...

65
00:05:43.928 --> 00:05:44.971
Whoops.

66
00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:47.015
Just simmer down.

67
00:05:47.598 --> 00:05:50.393
Otherwise. I might have trouble...

68
00:05:51.561 --> 00:05:54.397
...shaving your flesh cleanly off.

69
00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:06.492
How filthy...

70
00:06:15.585 --> 00:06:16.753
Captain!

71
00:06:16.961 --> 00:06:20.006
I can't get the bleeding to stop...!

72
00:06:23.217 --> 00:06:25.636
Cap... tain...

73
00:06:29.766 --> 00:06:31.184
Yes?

74
00:06:32.351 --> 00:06:34.979
W-Was I...

75
00:06:35.188 --> 00:06:41.486
...helpful to humanity... at all...?

76
00:06:41.694 --> 00:06:46.115
Am I... going to die... without
having been...

77
00:06:46.324 --> 00:06:48.451
...any help at all...?

78
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.832
You achieved many great things.

79
00:06:55.041 --> 00:06:58.503
And... you'll continue to.

80
00:06:58.711 --> 00:07:04.217
The resolve you leave behind
will give me strength.

81
00:07:04.425 --> 00:07:05.927
I promise you.

82
00:07:06.135 --> 00:07:11.891
I <i>will</i> put an end to the Titans. without fail!

83
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.102
Captain...

84
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.729
He's already...

85
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.570
Did he hear it all?

86
00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:28.116
Yes. I'm sure he heard you.

87
00:07:28.324 --> 00:07:33.621
He's resting with a
look of relief on his face...

88
00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:37.500
That's good. then.

89
00:07:38.334 --> 00:07:39.752
Levi!

90
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.213
We're pulling out!

91
00:07:42.421 --> 00:07:44.298
- Huh?
- Pulling out?

92
00:07:44.507 --> 00:07:47.009
But we can still go further!

93
00:07:47.218 --> 00:07:48.886
My men will have died for nothing!

94
00:07:49.095 --> 00:07:53.641
A swarm of Titans has begun
moving northward. toward the city.

95
00:07:55.643 --> 00:07:57.687
This is just like five years ago.

96
00:07:57.895 --> 00:07:59.689
Somethings happening in town.

97
00:07:59.897 --> 00:08:03.860
It's possible the Wall's been destroyed.

98
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:06.988
Damn...

99
00:08:10.575 --> 00:08:11.993
Damn...

100
00:08:41.898 --> 00:08:45.985
This... This can't be happening...!

101
00:08:46.194 --> 00:08:49.238
We're nothing like
we were five years ago...

102
00:08:49.447 --> 00:08:51.407
We trained so hard...

103
00:08:51.616 --> 00:08:53.701
We studied so hard...

104
00:08:55.536 --> 00:08:58.372
To beat these things...

105
00:08:58.581 --> 00:09:01.792
To survive against them...

106
00:09:02.001 --> 00:09:03.753
Hot...

107
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:06.047
It's hot...

108
00:09:06.255 --> 00:09:08.257
Help me...

109
00:09:08.466 --> 00:09:09.884
Mom...

110
00:09:10.968 --> 00:09:12.386
Mom...

111
00:09:15.097 --> 00:09:16.515
Mom...

112
00:09:20.561 --> 00:09:21.979
Mom...

113
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.777
Help me...

114
00:09:27.985 --> 00:09:29.987
How did things turn out this way?

115
00:09:30.196 --> 00:09:33.741
Why has everything been taken from us?

116
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:35.368
Our lives...

117
00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:37.453
Our dreams...

118
00:09:38.871 --> 00:09:40.289
Why?!

119
00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:48.214
Damn it!

120
00:09:48.422 --> 00:09:50.508
Damn it! Damn it!

121
00:09:51.133 --> 00:09:53.636
I refuse to give up!

122
00:09:53.844 --> 00:09:58.724
I'll drive them all out!
Every last one!

123
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:03.062
By my own hand!

124
00:10:57.366 --> 00:11:00.661
I'll drive you out...

125
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.705
...from this world...

126
00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:09.962
Every last one of you...!

127
00:11:15.968 --> 00:11:17.178
More...

128
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.388
More!

129
00:11:19.972 --> 00:11:21.640
Kill more!

130
00:11:21.849 --> 00:11:23.768
I want to kill!

131
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.107
More... I'm going to...

132
00:11:30.316 --> 00:11:32.693
...kill more of you...

133
00:11:36.447 --> 00:11:37.865
Eren?

134
00:11:51.087 --> 00:11:52.505
Eren!

135
00:11:53.381 --> 00:11:55.883
Eren! Can you move on your own?!

136
00:11:56.092 --> 00:11:57.510
Are you yourself?!

137
00:11:57.718 --> 00:11:59.970
Tell them everything you know!

138
00:12:00.179 --> 00:12:02.807
I'm sure they'll understand!

139
00:12:03.557 --> 00:12:05.059
- Armin?!
- Did you hear him?!

140
00:12:05.267 --> 00:12:07.186
He said he's gonna kill us!

141
00:12:07.395 --> 00:12:09.522
Yeah. I heard it too.

142
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:13.025
He's planning on eating us!

143
00:12:13.234 --> 00:12:16.362
What are they talking about?

144
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:20.991
Are they pointing those swords at us?!

145
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.995
They're meant for
taking out Titans. though!

146
00:12:25.204 --> 00:12:28.624
Why are they looking at me like that?

147
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:33.170
What's going on here?!

148
00:12:49.186 --> 00:12:53.023
You cadets will prep up and
remain on standby!

149
00:12:54.275 --> 00:13:01.407
...And that's how we got ahold
of some gas and got out of Trost.

150
00:13:01.615 --> 00:13:03.451
You went through all that?

151
00:13:03.659 --> 00:13:04.869
I'm sorry.

152
00:13:05.077 --> 00:13:08.789
We kept volunteering
to help supply you guys. but...

153
00:13:08.998 --> 00:13:12.710
We'd even managed
to secure some gas. too.

154
00:13:12.918 --> 00:13:18.174
D-Does that mean
everyone who isn't here is...?

155
00:13:18.382 --> 00:13:19.800
Yeah...

156
00:13:21.385 --> 00:13:23.345
Even Mikasa?

157
00:13:23.554 --> 00:13:28.726
No. I'm pretty sure she came after us.
with Jean and the rest...

158
00:13:28.934 --> 00:13:33.022
Jean. Don't tell me
Mikasa got hurt or something?

159
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:37.276
Hey. What's wrong?

160
00:13:42.114 --> 00:13:46.619
I can't tell you. We've been
slapped with a confidentiality order.

161
00:13:46.827 --> 00:13:49.538
- A confidentiality order?
- That's crazy.

162
00:13:49.747 --> 00:13:53.375
There's no way it's staying
under wraps. though.

163
00:13:53.584 --> 00:13:57.046
The news is gonna spread
across mankind like wildfire.

164
00:13:58.297 --> 00:14:02.051
Assuming mankind
lasts long enough. anyway.

165
00:14:04.136 --> 00:14:06.096
That's pretty smart of the Corps of Engineers.

166
00:14:06.305 --> 00:14:10.059
using the Titans themselves as
a defensive wall of flesh.

167
00:14:10.267 --> 00:14:13.938
But we can't afford to let our guard down.

168
00:14:14.146 --> 00:14:15.940
After all. we're standing on the cliff's edge...

169
00:14:16.148 --> 00:14:20.486
the front lines in the battle
between humanity and the Titans.

170
00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:22.112
What's the matter?

171
00:14:22.321 --> 00:14:25.824
Oh. no. nothing's wrong with our mission.

172
00:14:26.033 --> 00:14:30.162
I'm just worried about my
friends assigned to the vanguard...

173
00:14:30.371 --> 00:14:33.958
I just saw a messenger headed
for HQ with a pale look on his face...

174
00:14:34.166 --> 00:14:35.125
Yeah.

175
00:14:35.334 --> 00:14:37.711
But our only focus should
be on fending them off.

176
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.214
just as we were originally trained.

177
00:14:41.507 --> 00:14:45.844
I heard you helped three
children escape five years ago

178
00:14:46.053 --> 00:14:48.514
and that they're cadets now.

179
00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:50.432
Were they part of the vanguard too?

180
00:14:50.641 --> 00:14:52.059
Yes...

181
00:14:52.768 --> 00:14:55.604
I apologize. I shouldn't have brought it up.

182
00:14:55.813 --> 00:14:57.565
They're fine.

183
00:14:57.773 --> 00:14:59.275
They're tough kids.

184
00:14:59.483 --> 00:15:02.278
They each have what it takes to survive.

185
00:15:02.486 --> 00:15:04.947
One's a proficient fighter.

186
00:15:05.155 --> 00:15:07.533
Another has immense inner strength.

187
00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:11.996
And the other is extremely intelligent.

188
00:15:12.204 --> 00:15:15.499
They're all right. They're alive for sure.

189
00:15:16.584 --> 00:15:20.921
Cadets Jaeger. Ackermann. and Arlelt!

190
00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.675
What you've committed is an act of treason!

191
00:15:24.883 --> 00:15:27.928
Whether you live or die depends on you!

192
00:15:28.137 --> 00:15:29.263
Huh?

193
00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:33.058
Should you try anything funny or
attempt to move from where you are.

194
00:15:33.267 --> 00:15:37.229
we'll blast you to bits immediately
and without hesitation!

195
00:15:37.438 --> 00:15:38.522
Huh?

196
00:15:38.731 --> 00:15:40.649
This is a direct question!

197
00:15:40.858 --> 00:15:43.485
What are you really?!

198
00:15:43.694 --> 00:15:46.780
Human?! Or Titan?!

199
00:15:46.989 --> 00:15:51.035
Wh-What kind of question is that?

200
00:15:51.243 --> 00:15:53.579
What's with that look?!

201
00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:57.916
It's almost like they're looking
at some kind of monster...

202
00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:00.210
Is that what they think of me?!

203
00:16:00.419 --> 00:16:04.590
L-I don't understand the question. Sir!

204
00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:06.759
Playing innocent. huh?!

205
00:16:06.967 --> 00:16:09.762
Just try that again. monster!

206
00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.680
We'll blast you into
pieces in the blink of an eye.

207
00:16:11.889 --> 00:16:15.643
before you can reveal your true form!

208
00:16:15.851 --> 00:16:17.019
True form?!

209
00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:20.022
Scores of people witnessed the moment

210
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:25.194
that you appeared from the body of a Titan!

211
00:16:25.402 --> 00:16:32.618
We've allowed an unknown being--
you--to infiltrate Wall Rose!

212
00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:37.081
Even if you are a member of
the Cadets as sanctioned by the king.

213
00:16:37.289 --> 00:16:40.376
it is well within reason for me to
eliminate any risk as quickly as possible!

214
00:16:40.584 --> 00:16:43.337
Of this. I feel certain!

215
00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:47.007
The Armored Titan that took down Wall Maria

216
00:16:47.216 --> 00:16:49.760
could appear at any moment now!

217
00:16:49.968 --> 00:16:54.181
As we speak. the very
survival of humanity is at stake!

218
00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.432
Understand?!

219
00:16:55.641 --> 00:17:00.813
We can't afford to waste any
further manpower or time on you!

220
00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:05.776
I <i>will</i> bombard you with
high explosives if I have to!

221
00:17:05.984 --> 00:17:10.489
Indeed. their defiance is obvious.

222
00:17:10.698 --> 00:17:14.034
It's unlikely we'll get any
beneficial information from them.

223
00:17:14.243 --> 00:17:17.955
As you said. this is a
waste of time and manpower.

224
00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:19.039
Sir!

225
00:17:19.248 --> 00:17:20.833
Now is our best chance!

226
00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:24.712
We should destroy him
while he's still in human form!

227
00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.922
My specialty...

228
00:17:27.131 --> 00:17:30.801
...is severing flesh.

229
00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:34.680
I'll gladly demonstrate it. if need be.

230
00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:38.267
If anyone wants to experience my technique...

231
00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:43.063
...then please. by all means. step this way.

232
00:17:43.272 --> 00:17:44.481
Sir.

233
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:49.319
Mikasa Ackermann was assigned to
escort duty with us elite soldiers.

234
00:17:49.528 --> 00:17:52.781
Her prowess is equal to that
of a hundred ordinary soldiers.

235
00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:56.118
Losing her would be a
great setback for humanity.

236
00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:58.787
Hey. Mikasa! Armin!

237
00:17:58.996 --> 00:18:00.080
What is all this?!

238
00:18:00.289 --> 00:18:01.331
Mikasa!

239
00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.584
Attacking people won't help!

240
00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:07.588
There's nowhere to run
inside this cramped wall!

241
00:18:07.796 --> 00:18:12.551
I don't care who it is.
I won't let anyone kill Eren.

242
00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.553
That's all that matters!

243
00:18:14.762 --> 00:18:16.221
Let's talk this out!

244
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:19.475
None of them understand the situation!

245
00:18:19.683 --> 00:18:22.770
That's why fear's spreading among them!

246
00:18:22.978 --> 00:18:26.482
Am I the only one who
doesn't think I'm a Titan...?!

247
00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.818
Damn! I have no memory of how I got here!

248
00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:35.908
I'm too weak to stand. and I could
end up dead if I say the wrong thing...

249
00:18:36.116 --> 00:18:38.076
Being killed by humans?

250
00:18:38.285 --> 00:18:40.162
That's insane...!

251
00:18:41.538 --> 00:18:47.628
What is this about me coming out
of a Titan's body. anyway?!

252
00:18:47.836 --> 00:18:50.547
What the hell are they talking about?!
How is that possible?!

253
00:18:50.756 --> 00:18:53.467
Does that mean that wasn't a dream?!

254
00:18:54.635 --> 00:18:56.345
If that's the case...

255
00:18:56.553 --> 00:19:00.432
...that means I grew an
arm where my sleeve is gone!

256
00:19:00.641 --> 00:19:03.644
That makes me practically like a Titan!

257
00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:06.063
That's impossible...

258
00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:07.940
How could I...?

259
00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:08.649
How?!

260
00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:10.442
I'll ask one more time!

261
00:19:10.651 --> 00:19:13.237
What are you really?!

262
00:19:15.948 --> 00:19:18.700
I <i>can't</i> answer this wrong...

263
00:19:18.909 --> 00:19:22.120
I won't be the only one who'll die...

264
00:19:22.329 --> 00:19:26.500
Yeah. I've always been...

265
00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:29.753
...the same as you!

266
00:19:29.962 --> 00:19:31.588
I'm human!

267
00:19:41.682 --> 00:19:43.642
I see...

268
00:19:43.851 --> 00:19:46.770
Don't take this personally.

269
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.566
This is just how it has to be.

270
00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:55.028
Because no one can prove...

271
00:19:55.237 --> 00:19:58.615
...that they <i>aren't</i> a monster.

272
00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:02.369
Eren! Armin!

273
00:20:02.578 --> 00:20:03.662
Head up the wall!

274
00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:05.289
Stop!

275
00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:13.463
Eren.

276
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.718
When I get back.
I'll show you the basement

277
00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:20.429
that I've kept secret all this time.

278
00:20:22.556 --> 00:20:26.935
Keep this key on you at all times.

279
00:20:27.144 --> 00:20:31.481
And every time you see it. remember.

280
00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:35.068
Remember that you
must visit that basement!

281
00:20:37.613 --> 00:20:42.075
This injection will
make you forget all of this.

282
00:20:42.284 --> 00:20:46.413
so there's no use explaining now.

283
00:20:46.622 --> 00:20:47.623
Listen.

284
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:52.920
You <i>must</i> retake Wall Maria
and reach the basement!

285
00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:58.008
I'm certain this ability
will help when that time comes!

286
00:20:58.216 --> 00:21:02.304
Their memories will tell you how to use it!

287
00:21:02.512 --> 00:21:03.931
Eren!

288
00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:09.978
You'll understand the truth someday.
if you visit the basement!

289
00:21:10.187 --> 00:21:12.648
It will be a harsh. painful journey...

290
00:21:12.856 --> 00:21:14.858
...but you <i>must</i> reach it!

291
00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:22.741
If you want to save
Mikasa. Armin. and everyone else...

292
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:27.788
...you must learn to control this ability!

293
00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.482
Did we get him?

294
00:22:07.202 --> 00:22:09.037
This can't be...

295
00:22:37.399 --> 00:22:42.320
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

296
00:22:42.529 --> 00:22:48.577
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

297
00:22:48.785 --> 00:22:53.248
<i>Over and over you cast them aside.
only to find more</i>

298
00:22:53.457 --> 00:22:59.921
<i>Now. rest in peace</i>

299
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:11.266
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

300
00:23:11.475 --> 00:23:21.526
<i>and the more we forget
the more we remember again</i>

301
00:23:21.735 --> 00:23:27.491
<i>In this beautiful. cruel world</i>

302
00:23:27.699 --> 00:23:32.662
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

303
00:23:32.871 --> 00:23:38.376
<i>Oh. with our strength--and our weakness--</i>

304
00:23:38.585 --> 00:23:44.049
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

305
00:23:44.257 --> 00:23:47.677
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

306
00:23:54.643 --> 00:24:00.732
"Eren isn't humanity's enemy."
Armin desperately pleads.

307
00:24:00.941 --> 00:24:04.486
But the Garrison Regiment.
consumed by fear and abandoning all logic.

308
00:24:04.694 --> 00:24:07.989
makes the decision to execute Eren.

9999
00:00:0.500 --> 00:00:2.00
