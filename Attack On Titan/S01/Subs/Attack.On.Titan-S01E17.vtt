﻿1
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.900
Go. Eren!

2
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.760
In the year 850...

3
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.679
For the first time.

4
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.840
humanity recovered part of its
territory from the Titans.

5
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.530
Though at great cost.

6
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.300
Then I welcome everyone
here to the Survey Corps!

7
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.640
This is a true salute!

8
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.390
Offer up your hearts!

9
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.320
Yes. sir!

10
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.660
You have done well to endure your fear.

11
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.570
You are brave soldiers.

12
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.980
You have my heartfelt respect.

13
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.990
A month later.

14
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.039
led by Erwin Smith. the
Survey Corps left Karanes

15
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.489
to find a route to Zhiganshina.

16
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.540
where it's believed the secrets
of the Titans are held.

17
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.300
We will now begin the 57th
expedition beyond the walls!

18
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.140
Onward!

20
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.980
Female Titan
57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (1)

21
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.380
Ahead. to the left. a 10-meter class!

22
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.260
I am very interested in seeing
what's inside its stomach...

23
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.760
But I'll leave it to the support team!

24
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.890
Damn!

25
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.390
Not deep enough.

26
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.900
Defend the formation!

27
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.440
Stay strong!

28
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.830
Leave it to the support
team. and keep going!

29
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.950
Onward! Onward!

30
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.960
The support teams will only
accompany us to the old city area.

31
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.400
Once we're past that.
it's completely Titan territory.

32
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.220
The long-range scouting formation devised
by Commander Erwin is our only hope.

33
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.610
We. the special ops squad. are here.

34
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.260
Sir. can they...

35
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.150
Can my classmates beat the Titans?

36
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.520
Huh?

37
00:04:16.521 --> 00:04:19.670
What have you been doing the past month?

38
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.939
Listen. brat...

39
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.699
The most crucial part

40
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.320
of an expedition is in how
you avoid fighting Titansâ"

41
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.170
Go into long-range scouting formation!

42
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.680
See ya. Armin.

43
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.050
If you run into a Titan.
don't piss your pants!

44
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.639
Right!

45
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.780
Same to you. Jean.

46
00:04:54.406 --> 00:04:55.916
Row 3-3: Relay

47
00:04:55.941 --> 00:04:57.550
The vanguard is to spread
out in a semi-circle.

48
00:04:57.575 --> 00:05:01.215
But stay within visual
range of one another.

49
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.760
Row 5-Center: Standby

50
00:05:02.785 --> 00:05:04.585
Position yourselves at fixed intervals.

51
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.670
Extend the recon and message relay
range as far as possible.

52
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.280
We'll be fine...

53
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.610
Calm down!

54
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.660
It's primarily the forward recon squad
that will encounter Titans.

55
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.700
As soon as one is sighted.
they'll fire a red smoke round.

56
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.110
Anyone who sees the flare should fire
the same round to relay the signal.

57
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.179
When the Commander sees it.

58
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.140
he'll fire a green smoke round.

59
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.770
and show the formation where to go.

60
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.519
Thus. the entire formation can advance

61
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.860
toward the goal. while avoiding Titans.

62
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.989
But sometimes. due to terrain or obstacles.

63
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.120
a Titan won't be sighted until
it's within the formation.

64
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.459
Red... Red...

65
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.920
Red smoke round...

66
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.800
Blause! Over here!

67
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.669
Damn it! Did we let one through?

68
00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.060
We'll draw it this way.

69
00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.440
Blause. get over here!

70
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.240
I'll handle it!

71
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.190
Split off!

72
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.160
Yes. sir!

73
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.719
Sir...

74
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.010
Back into position!

75
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.770
He ran out of gas.

76
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.610
Something's wrong...

77
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.369
It's been a while since we
saw the red smoke round.

78
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.980
but they still haven't reformed.

79
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.490
It can't be...

80
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.909
Note that this strategy only
works on normal Titans.

81
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.240
whose behavior can be easily predicted.

82
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.660
A black smoke round?

83
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.009
Is a Titan ignoring the nearby humans

84
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.210
and heading for the formation's center?

85
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.000
It has to be...

86
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:09.590
That's

87
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.190
an Aberrant!

88
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.849
It's only necessary to fight Aberrants.

89
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.509
whose behavior is unpredictable.

90
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.099
Damn. we'll have to fight it...

91
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.940
Sys. go for the neck!

92
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.899
I'll stop it!

93
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.230
Roger!

94
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.319
Using Maneuver Gear on flat
terrain is a huge disadvantage.

95
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.320
It almost never works.

96
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.480
But I can't let it disrupt the formation.

97
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.979
I think that's Arlert over there.

98
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.810
I don't want one of the
new guys to run into it.

99
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:44.370
We kill it here!

100
00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.130
Now. Sys!

101
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.270
You did it. Squad Leader Ness!

102
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.190
Did I get him?

103
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.429
You came for me?

104
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.370
That's my partner...

105
00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.670
I love you. Shallot!

106
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:24.990
Again?

107
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.959
What is the right flank recon squad doing?

108
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.869
If it ignored them and came this way.

109
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.620
it must be another Aberrant.

110
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:33.940
Oh. fine...

111
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.009
Sys. we do it again.

112
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:37.800
Right.

113
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.310
But we've got the worst luck.
doing this twice in a row...

114
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.370
And I think it's at least
a fourteen-meter class.

115
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.390
This one will be tough.

116
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.209
What's that?

117
00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.370
It's too fast!

118
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.329
Don't let it reach Arlert!

119
00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:02.030
Sys!

120
00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:03.570
Right!

121
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.280
No... No.

122
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.920
That's no Aberrant.

123
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.620
It's intelligent!

124
00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.850
Like the Armored or
Colossal Titans. or Eren...

125
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.830
A human in the body of a Titan!

126
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:51.330
B-But who?

127
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.840
Why?

128
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.800
This is bad! What should I do?

129
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.969
I'm going to die. too...

130
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:56.880
I'll be killed!

131
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.380
Go! Run!

132
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.310
What does it...

133
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.810
No. what do they...

134
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.980
What do they want?

135
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.050
Someone tell them...

136
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:30.170
That the right flank recon squad
has been wiped out...

137
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:35.450
A Female Titan brought
a huge Titan army!

138
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.560
Is anyone there?

139
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.160
It's not going to kill me?

140
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.840
Why?

141
00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.040
It removed my hood...

142
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:49.740
To... To look at my face?

143
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:51.310
Armin!

144
00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.570
Reiner!

145
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.300
Hey. can you stand?

146
00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:01.589
You won't last outside the walls
unless you're on horseback...

147
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:02.590
Hurry!

148
00:13:02.591 --> 00:13:03.630
Right!

149
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:08.519
I saw the smoke round
signaling an Aberrant.

150
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.969
Was it that one there with the nice ass?

151
00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:12.549
That's no Aberrant...

152
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.600
It's a human in a Titan body!

153
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.100
What was that?

154
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:18.369
Wait a second.

155
00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:19.900
We need to fire a smoke round first.

156
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.500
H-Hurry...

157
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.550
There's an emergency over there.

158
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.110
With a smoke round. I'll...

159
00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:29.330
Wait... I think Jean fired it.

160
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.439
It came from the right flank.

161
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.290
Does that mean we're so compromised.
we can't continue the mission?

162
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.589
Looks like the right flank recon
squad was partially wiped out...

163
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.679
Titans. tons of them.

164
00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.920
I don't know why.

165
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.049
but there are lots of fast ones.

166
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.859
For now. we're holding them back.

167
00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.760
but recon is no longer possible...

168
00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.869
We've taken heavy losses.

169
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.670
and if we aren't careful.
we'll be destroyed!

170
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.310
That Titan came from the same direction.

171
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:58.730
No way...

172
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.410
Was it leading the Titans?

173
00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.030
It?

174
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.030
Why is a Titan over there?

175
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:07.500
An Aberrant?

176
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:13.499
No. it's a human in a Titan body...

177
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.620
Someone with the same ability as Eren.

178
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.370
What?

179
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.060
Why do you think that. Armin?

180
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.840
The Titans only eat us.

181
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.519
We're just killed in the process.

182
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.800
Killing us isn't ever
specifically their goal.

183
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.060
But when Sys aimed for its weak spot.

184
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.520
it crushed him and smashed
him into the ground.

185
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.340
It killed him to kill.
rather than to eat him.

186
00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.070
Its nature is different from the others.

187
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:47.629
When the Colossal and Armored
Titans destroyed the walls.

188
00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:51.330
it must've been the one that
brought that army of Titans.

189
00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:55.130
Their goal has consistently
been to attack all humanity!

190
00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.580
No. maybe not.

191
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.720
It felt like it was looking for someone...

192
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.970
If that is the case.
could it be looking for...

193
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.760
Could it be looking for Eren?

194
00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:09.799
Eren?

195
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.300
Eren's with Squad Levi. which is
in charge of the right flank.

196
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.230
The right flank?

197
00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.870
The plans I got had them
to the rear of the left flank.

198
00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:26.800
Mine said they were near
the front of the right...

199
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.240
Wait. there's no way they'd
be on the front lines.

200
00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.120
So where are they?

201
00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:36.800
Probably the safest place in the formation.

202
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.790
Which means in the center.
and toward the rear...

203
00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.250
Armin!

204
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.010
There's no time to think.

205
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.510
Smoke rounds can't possibly indicate
how much of a threat it poses!

206
00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.529
At this rate. it'll wipe out command.

207
00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:55.739
Then the formation will fall apart.
and that'll be the end.

208
00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.100
What are you trying to say?

209
00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:58.959
In other words.

210
00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.830
at this range. we may still be
able to draw its attention.

211
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.550
We may be able to buy time to withdraw.

212
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.280
Maybe... Maybe...

213
00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.990
But it really is intelligent.

214
00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.949
To it. we are nothing but
insignificant insects.

215
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.040
It'll just crush us...

216
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.560
Seriously?

217
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:24.540
That's scary...

218
00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:27.829
Hey. are you really Jean?

219
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:32.050
The Jean I know never thinks
of anyone but himself.

220
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.590
Don't be an ass...

221
00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:41.350
I just don't want those charred bones I saw

222
00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.840
to be disappointed in me!

223
00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:46.640
I...

224
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.040
I know what I have to do now!

225
00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.299
And this is the job we chose.

226
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.490
Help me!

227
00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.689
Put on your hood.

228
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:02.809
As far forward as you can...

229
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.830
So that your face is hidden from it.

230
00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:09.779
I don't think it will kill us until
it knows who we are!

231
00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:10.960
Oh...

232
00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:14.770
You believe if it thinks we might
be Eren. it won't kill us?

233
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:17.349
If nothing else. it'll make me feel better.

234
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:20.470
Let's just hope it has poor eyesight!

235
00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:26.710
Armin. I thought it was creepy
how you always clung to Eren.

236
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:28.830
But I've always thought you had it in you.

237
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.570
Uh. thanks.

238
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.820
But "creepy"? That's really mean...

239
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.170
It's going much more slowly
than when I first saw it.

240
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:53.730
Is it tired?

241
00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:57.150
If it runs at that speed
again. we'll be too late!

242
00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.390
Now's our chance... We have to do it now!

243
00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.520
Listen up... Remember what I said.

244
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:12.799
Try to draw its attention
for as long as possible.

245
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.169
to give the formation time to withdraw!

246
00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:17.380
Keep it here as long as you can.

247
00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.530
If we could cut its Achilles tendon.
that'd be more than enough.

248
00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:24.449
But don't do anything stupid...

249
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:25.850
Don't try to kill it!

250
00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:29.080
It's aware of the weak spot on its neck.

251
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.849
It's totally different than other Titans...

252
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:33.440
It is impossible to kill.

253
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:38.070
At least. not by any normal human being.

254
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:42.430
However...

255
00:18:42.431 --> 00:18:44.690
If it's those two... Maybe...

256
00:19:26.037 --> 00:19:26.897
Armin!

257
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.509
This one...

258
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.809
Its movements are much more
precise than the others' are!

259
00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:33.899
Damn it.

260
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:34.990
I...

261
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:37.160
I underestimated it!

262
00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.130
It protected its neck...

263
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.090
Jean!

264
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.960
Damn it! I can't get away!

265
00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.220
I'm going to die!

266
00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.590
Once it grasps my wire. it's over!

267
00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:57.019
Jean!

268
00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:00.010
Avenge the bastard who rushed to his death!

269
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.510
Armin?

270
00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.210
It stopped?

271
00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.789
That's the one...

272
00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.539
That's the one that killed him!

273
00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.339
He rushed to his death on the right flank!

274
00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.730
Avenge him!

275
00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:21.550
What happened?

276
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.399
Did Armin hit his head and go insane?

277
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.120
This isn't the time...

278
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:28.650
R-Reiner?

279
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.370
It crushed my best friend!

280
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.330
I saw his body under its foot!

281
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.210
He's going straight for the neck?

282
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.879
No. it's working!

283
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.550
While it's distracted by Armin!

284
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.260
H-Hey...

285
00:21:07.253 --> 00:21:10.693
H-Hey... Reiner. you...

286
00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:30.050
Reiner did it!

287
00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:32.709
Mikasa was so strong. I forgot.

288
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:35.890
But he's really strong and reliable. too...

289
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.819
We've bought enough time. right?

290
00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.480
Let's get the hell away from it!

291
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.730
If it isn't a man-eater.
it won't follow us!

292
00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.189
Look...

293
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:58.490
That big bitch got scared
and decided to go home!

294
00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:01.330
No... Why?

295
00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:04.070
That's toward the center rear.

296
00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.650
Is it

297
00:22:06.363 --> 00:22:08.083
heading toward Eren?

298
00:22:09.133 --> 00:22:12.329
