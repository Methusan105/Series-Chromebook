﻿1
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.980
After setting out to establish
a route to Shiganshina.

2
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.480
the Scout Regiment encountered
an intelligent. female Titan.

3
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.660
As soldier after soldier fell.

4
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.070
the regiment rushed
into a forest of giant trees.

5
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.670
much to everyone's puzzlement.

6
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.900
Who can possibly stop it.
if not the Levi Squad?!

7
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.410
Another one's dead!

8
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.710
We could've saved him. too!

9
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.380
Choose.

10
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.380
Will you trust yourself.

11
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.910
or me. these guys.
and the entire Scout Regiment?

12
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.390
I'll go with you!

13
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.720
Fire!

14
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.540
You don't mean?!

15
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.010
They're going to take that Titan alive?!

16
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.920
What do you think of that. Eren?!
We caught that Titan!

17
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.050
This is the might of the Scout Regiment!
Don't underrate us. you idiot!

18
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.890
Now do you see?!

19
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.590
Yes!

20
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.030
It looks like she's stopped.

21
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.070
We can't drop our guard yet.

22
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.240
I'm just impressed you
managed to lead her to this spot.

23
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.740
The credit goes to the rear squad
members who gave their lives fighting her.

24
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.110
They bought us time.

25
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.580
It would've been impossible otherwise.

26
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.110
Is that so?

27
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.550
Yes.

28
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.490
Thanks to them...

29
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.890
...we get to see who's
inside this one's nape.

30
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.450
Let's just hope they're not
wetting themself inside there...

"Erwin Smith"
-The 57th Exterior Scouting Mission. Part 4-

40
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.170
An Abnormal...

41
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.660
Or is it like the Colossal Titan?

42
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.710
Wait. did Commander Erwin actually...?

43
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.280
Hey! Quit spacin' out!

44
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.280
Eren!

45
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.880
You can think later!
We need to get further ahead!

46
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.280
Right!

47
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.890
Wait. Levi.

48
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.730
We need to be extra cautious.

49
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.290
Waves 2 and 3!

50
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.360
Fire!

51
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.590
Use the reserves too!

52
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.950
Umm. they're starting to climb up...

53
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.150
Indeed.

54
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.290
If they make it up this far.
perhaps I'll step out of the way.

55
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.490
Although...

56
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.500
I suspect we'll soon be given
orders to withdraw anyway.

57
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.570
Does it have something to do
with those explosions inside the forest?

58
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.160
I don't know.

59
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.140
Mikasa...

60
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.610
What do you think those sounds are?

61
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.840
Are cannons being
fired inside the forest?

62
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.820
I didn't <i>see them bring
any cannons in. though...</i>

63
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.790
What's with all this damn noise?

64
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.290
Hey. Mr. Bertholdt.

65
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.620
Do you know which way Christa went?

66
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.960
Sorry. I don't.

67
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.360
Nothing makes sense anymore.

68
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.800
What are we even doing now. and why?

69
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.360
I wanna go home...

70
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.360
- Let's move away. Armin!
- Right!

71
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.310
Looks like the bastard's
gotten the hang of it.

72
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.820
It's gotten better and
better at tree-climbing!

73
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.490
The scary thing is that
this means they can learn.

74
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.190
Although I'm sure it's
different for each Titan too.

75
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.630
Armin.

76
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.460
They seem to be up to
something inside the forest.

77
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.460
and I think I've
figured out what it is.

78
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.130
They lured that female Titan here

79
00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.730
to capture her.

80
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:06.010
Or. more precisely.
to capture the human inside.

81
00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.480
That was Commander Erwin's goal...

82
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.150
...from the very start.

83
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.480
Wasn't it?!

84
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.420
Still. I can understand keeping
it from us rookies. but you guys too?!

85
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.660
You've been Scouts a long time!

86
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.030
Man. you're annoying!

87
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.030
Are you suggesting the commander
and the captain don't trust us?!

88
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.700
N-No. but that's what
this means. doesn't it?!

89
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.900
Petra! Knock out his teeth!

90
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.700
Switch his front teeth with his back ones!

91
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.540
No. Eren's right.

92
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.880
The captain must've had a
reason for not trusting us implicitly.

93
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.080
Like what?

94
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.580
There's only one reason
he couldn't trust his comrades.

95
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.690
There's someone in the regiment
who can either turn into a Titan

96
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.380
or is working as a sort of spy for them.

97
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.290
You think so too. right?
That there's someone in the regiment...

98
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.790
Mm. I think there is.

99
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.900
A spy?

100
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.810
Are you really sure?

101
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.410
At the very least.
the commander must believe so.

102
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.480
I assume the only soldiers
informed of this operation

103
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.820
were the ones who survived five years ago.

104
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:19.950
I see.

105
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.320
So that's why...

106
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.420
Yep. that's gotta be it.

107
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.920
Get it. Eren?
That's what's goin' on.

108
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.560
Mm. In that case. it couldn't be helped.

109
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.830
Yeah...

110
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.630
Five years ago
was when the wall first fell...

111
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.100
Could they be using that
fact to narrow down suspects

112
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.940
on the assumption
that's when the spy got inside?

113
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.960
Does that mean this person
killed Sawney and Beane too?

114
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.800
The commander asked me
something after that happened...

115
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.980
What do <i>you see here?</i>

116
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.490
What do you think the enemy is?

117
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.950
Is <i>that what that meant?</i>

118
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.260
We might've been allowed
to join the operation

119
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.860
if we'd known the answer to that question.

120
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.960
I doubt any of us could have. though.

121
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.130
Well. I knew.

122
00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:14.200
But I decided not to say anything.
Do you guys know why?

123
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.010
Why?

124
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.640
What. you mean you don't know?

125
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.610
I guess guys like
you wouldn't know. huh?

126
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.010
You're nowhere near my
level yet. after all.

127
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:28.450
Seriously. are you still
trying to imitate Captain Levi?

128
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.150
He doesn't talk like that.

129
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:35.160
If this succeeds. we might actually
learn the truth about this world.

130
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.230
Still. even for that...

131
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.320
...way too many people have died.

132
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.560
Do you think the commander
was wrong to do this?

133
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.240
He wasn't in the right.
I'll tell you that.

134
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.480
If we'd actually been told
that a Titan had inside info.

135
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.850
we would've handled things differently.

136
00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.840
Your own squad members. for example...

137
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.930
- No. it wasn't wrong.
- Huh?

138
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.830
How can you say that?

139
00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:16.200
Do you know how many
soldiers have needlessly died?!

140
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.430
Jean.

141
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.740
In hindsight. it's easy to
say what should've been done.

142
00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.510
But...

143
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.940
No one can tell how things will turn out.

144
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:29.280
Yet. at some point
you <i>have to make a choice.</i>

145
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.520
The lives of a hundred comrades...

146
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.420
...or the lives of
everyone inside the walls.

147
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.550
The commander chose.

148
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:41.790
He chose to throw away
the lives of a hundred comrades.

149
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.060
Eren.

150
00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:47.030
If you didn't know already.
you'll soon learn why

151
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:53.570
Erwin Smith was put in charge
of the Scouts. of humanity's hope...

152
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.610
It's why he even
has Captain Levi's trust!

153
00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:00.440
That's assuming you
survive long enough. of course.

154
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.910
I don't have much
life experience yet...

155
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.380
...but I <i>do know one thing.</i>

156
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.620
If there's anyone who
can bring about change.

157
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:14.460
it's someone capable of
giving up what matters most.

158
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.260
In particular. people who are capable
of abandoning their humanity

159
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.900
when forced to rise above monsters.

160
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.730
Those who can't abandon anything...

161
00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.600
...can't change anything.

162
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.550
Fire!

163
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.890
How do you like that?

164
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:41.030
Now you can't scratch a
single itch or move a single muscle.

165
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.930
And you probably never will again.

166
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:50.200
The more your wounds heal.
the stiffer your joints will get!

167
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.940
Still. why haven't they
extracted our esteemed guest yet?

168
00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.810
What are Levi and Miche doing?!

169
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.580
So she has the ability to cover portions
of her body with hardened skin...

170
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:34.410
Much like the Armored Titan I've heard about.

171
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:39.790
Will it weaken if we continue
an ODM sword assault?

172
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:41.690
There's no time to try.

173
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.520
In which case...

174
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:45.630
Sir!

175
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.590
Prepare to blast it.

176
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:49.360
Blow off the target's hands.

177
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.660
Yes. Sir!

178
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.670
However. there's a
risk our standard artillery

179
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:57.200
could take out everything
on the inside as well.

180
00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:02.040
Then let's attempt to
sever the wrists instead.

181
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.340
Fire an all-out salvo on my signal.

182
00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.970
Understood!

183
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:19.060
Hey. Just come out already. will you?

184
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.460
We don't got time for this.

185
00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.400
Say. what do you think's
gonna happen to you now?

186
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:31.800
Do you really think you
can get out of this situation?

187
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.210
I wish you'd pay some thought
to the trouble you've caused us.

188
00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:40.880
You killed our men in
all sorts of different ways.

189
00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.540
Was it fun?

190
00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.590
Well. <i>I'm having fun now.</i>

191
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.490
I take it you're the same way.

192
00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:55.430
If there's anyone who
knows how I feel. it's you.

193
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.860
Oh. right.

194
00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.860
There's one thing I need to ask.

195
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:05.070
Will you be fine if
your limbs get cut off?

196
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.540
They'll go grow back. right?

197
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.780
I'm talking about your <i>actual body.</i>

198
00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:15.210
Can't afford to have
you die on us. after all...

199
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:50.110
Damn. You startled me there.

200
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.580
Were those her death throes?

201
00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.220
Erwin. I smell them.

202
00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.430
Which direction?

203
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.390
All directions. all at once!
Lots of them!

204
00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:10.270
What the?!
They're rushing into the forest all at once!

205
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.600
Why are they suddenly ignoring us?!

206
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.110
What?!

207
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.980
Does this mean they're <i>all Abnormals?!</i>

208
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.780
Doesn't matter! Don't let 'em through!

209
00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.910
Commence combat!

210
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.790
What was that all of a sudden?!

211
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:31.620
Please. wait!

212
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:35.430
I've heard screams like that before!

213
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.460
In the forest where I'm from!

214
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.200
It's the sound a cornered animal makes
when it's ready to give up everything!

215
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.540
I was taught the end of a hunt
is when you have to be most careful!

216
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.610
So you want me to be careful?

217
00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.880
Please be a hundred times
more careful than normal!

218
00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.480
You <i>will die if you
don't take the forest seriously!</i>

219
00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.980
I'm from the mountains too. actually...

220
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.620
You're a vegetable farmer!
You wouldn't understand!

221
00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.020
I see.

222
00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.890
Sasha's hunches <i>are often right.</i>

223
00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:06.960
And it's usually only before
something bad happens...

224
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.620
Armin said Eren might be in the
rear of the center rank. as I recall...

225
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.510
Hurry with artillery!

226
00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:20.510
Erwin!

227
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.700
The first wave is coming
from the east! They're close!

228
00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.740
Wagon defense squad! Intercept them!

229
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:37.060
They're ignoring us?!
Are they Abnormals?!

230
00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.890
Three Titans have broken through!

231
00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.030
Captain Levi!

232
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.730
Hey. you...

233
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:45.660
You just did something. didn't you?

234
00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.500
It went for the female one?

235
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:03.750
Titans coming from all directions!

236
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.220
All soldiers. commence combat!

237
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.020
Defend the Female Titan at all costs!

238
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.040
No!

239
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.050
All soldiers. withdraw!

240
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.220
Redeploy the formation!

241
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:48.290
Return to Calaneth District!

242
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:08.310
We've been bested.

243
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.020
What's with that pathetic look of yours?

244
00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:19.130
This goes to show that the enemy
was prepared to throw away everything.

245
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:22.700
I never imagined our target
would resort to Titan cannibalization

246
00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.260
to dispose of information...

247
00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.640
After all that blustering we did
in the courtroom. this is how it turns out...

248
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.710
If we waltz back there now.

249
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:35.340
who knows what'll happen to Eren or us...

250
00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.780
We can think about that once we've returned.

251
00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:42.520
For now. we need to focus on returning
without sustaining any further losses.

252
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.950
For now.

253
00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:48.150
The steam is impairing visibility.

254
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:51.680
It could hinder smoke signal communications.

255
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:59.000
I'm going to get my squad.

256
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.830
Wait. Levi.

257
00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:03.070
Replenish your gas and blades first.

258
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:06.410
We're low on time and
I have enough to last already.

259
00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:07.640
Why?

260
00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.380
That's an order. Do as you're told.

261
00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.370
Whatever you say. Erwin.

262
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.180
I'll trust your judgment.

263
00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.760
The withdrawal signal.

264
00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.070
We're all to withdraw and
return to base on horseback.

265
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.370
Right!

266
00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:39.600
What? Is it all over?

267
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:45.380
All right! We can go home!

268
00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.710
Just what's going on?

269
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:49.700
Is Eren all right?

270
00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.790
Looks like it's over.

271
00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.520
Let's get back to the
horses! Prepare to withdraw!

272
00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.620
You heard the man.

273
00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:01.750
Let's go see what the
bastard riding inside it looks like.

274
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.770
Did they really find out who it is?

275
00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.800
All thanks to you!

276
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.600
Huh? But I didn't do anything.

277
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.270
You trusted us. remember?

278
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:16.410
Things turned out this way
because you chose to stick with us.

279
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:20.640
Making the right call is a pretty
hard thing to do. you know!

280
00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:24.420
Hey. now. Quit pamperin' him. Petra.

281
00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.550
How was <i>he any help?</i>

282
00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:30.060
All he did was whine
like a pathetic little brat.

283
00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.460
I guess making it back alive <i>might
be considered praiseworthy.</i>

284
00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:37.430
but only after the
mission's done and over with.

285
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:41.830
Just so you know. twerp. an expedition
ain't over 'til you're back home.

286
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.930
Yes. I get it already!

287
00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.270
Oruo! Petra!

288
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.740
For a couple of soldiers who cried and
pissed their pants during their first battle.

289
00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.610
you've really grown!

290
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:55.780
Don't mention that!

291
00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.280
Are you <i>trying to make
him lose respect for me. Eld?!</i>

292
00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.790
Whoa. she really did?!

293
00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.020
It's the truth.

294
00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.590
And. just so you know.
I never pissed myself. Eren.

295
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:07.330
You idiot! I'll have you know
I have the highest kill count!

296
00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:08.860
I'm the best. you moron!

297
00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.700
There's more to a soldier's
merits than just kill counts!

298
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.500
Shut up. you idiot!

299
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.200
Ms. Petra! Does that mean
it sprayed everywhere in midair?!

300
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.600
Knock it off!

301
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.310
Are you on a picnic or something?!

302
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.270
We're outside the walls. you know!

303
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:24.300
Also. I never wet myself either. Eren!

304
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:37.660
Oh. That must be a
message from Captain Levi.

305
00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.490
We're rendezvousing with the captain!
Stow the chatter until we're home!

306
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.380
Erwin.

307
00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.320
Why did you have
Levi replenish his supplies

308
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.190
when there's no time to waste?

309
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:09.160
The female was eaten.

310
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.730
But did you see the
person inside get eaten?

311
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:14.160
I didn't.

312
00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:15.900
Are you saying?!

313
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:16.930
Yes.

314
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.530
If. as you deduced earlier.

315
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:24.200
we're dealing with a type that remains
able-bodied after de-transformation...

316
00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:29.200
And. if said person had equipped
themselves with ODM gear in advance...

317
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:35.370
...that means they're now
wearing one of our uniforms...

318
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:37.440
Captain Levi?

319
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.090
No... It's not!
