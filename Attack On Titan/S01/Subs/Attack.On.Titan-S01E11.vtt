1
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.718
The year 850. Trost District.

2
00:00:08.927 --> 00:00:13.348
The sight of Eren Jaeger triggering
his mysterious Titan ability

3
00:00:13.556 --> 00:00:18.520
was more than enough to strike terror
into the hearts of his fellow soldiers.

4
00:00:20.063 --> 00:00:22.023
I-I'm...

5
00:00:22.232 --> 00:00:23.650
...human!

6
00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:27.278
He is <i>not</i> an enemy of humanity!

7
00:00:27.487 --> 00:00:29.489
For humanity's glory.

8
00:00:29.698 --> 00:00:32.367
in what little time I have left to live.

9
00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:35.620
I will continue to advocate
his strategic value!

10
00:00:39.082 --> 00:00:43.253
As Eren and friends desperately pleaded.
only one man spoke up for them:

11
00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:49.384
Dot Pyxis. the top officer in charge
of the entire southern territory.

12
00:00:50.427 --> 00:00:56.516
Something tells me we ought
to hear these people out. you see...

13
00:01:12.365 --> 00:01:17.203
<i>Unknown are the names
of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

14
00:01:17.412 --> 00:01:22.667
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth
and long for the wind</i>

15
00:01:22.876 --> 00:01:27.756
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

16
00:01:27.964 --> 00:01:33.094
<i>Only the will to fight
can change the here and now!</i>

17
00:01:33.303 --> 00:01:38.391
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve
to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

18
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.935
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

19
00:01:41.144 --> 00:01:43.813
<i>Give us the freedom of dying.
starving wolves!</i>

20
00:01:44.022 --> 00:01:49.194
<i>The humiliation of being caged
is what triggers us to fight back</i>

21
00:01:49.402 --> 00:01:54.491
<i>We hunters slaughter prey
beyond the castle walls.</i>

22
00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:59.704
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust.</i>

23
00:01:59.913 --> 00:02:06.836
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows
pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

24
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.658
I'll do it!

25
00:02:36.866 --> 00:02:39.452
I don't know if
I can plug the hole or not!

26
00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:41.120
But...

27
00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.164
I'll do it!

28
00:02:46.751 --> 00:02:50.213
Well said! You're a real man!

29
00:02:52.924 --> 00:02:55.718
Calling all staff officers!
We have a plan to put together!

30
00:02:55.927 --> 00:02:57.637
Huh?! You can't be serious!

31
00:02:57.846 --> 00:03:00.849
It was just some half-baked
plan I came up with on the spot!

32
00:03:01.057 --> 00:03:03.101
We're actually going through with it?!

33
00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:05.103
That's what I thought too.

34
00:03:05.311 --> 00:03:08.857
but there's no point
in doubting his decision.

35
00:03:09.065 --> 00:03:13.361
Commander Pyxis must be envisioning
something that we can't yet see.

36
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.946
Something we can't see?

37
00:03:15.154 --> 00:03:17.949
Plus. I think there's a bigger
issue that needs to be addressed

38
00:03:18.157 --> 00:03:20.952
before we can carry out the plan.

39
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.372
And the commander is
keenly aware of it.

40
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:26.291
Which would be...?

41
00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:29.961
That the Titans aren't the only enemy.

42
00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.505
Time is of the essence.

43
00:03:35.717 --> 00:03:40.013
We're counting on you. young soldiers.

44
00:03:53.943 --> 00:03:55.695
An operation to retake Trost?!

45
00:03:55.904 --> 00:03:59.365
They can't be serious! We have
no way to plug that hole in the gate!

46
00:03:59.574 --> 00:04:01.326
What is the top brass thinking?!

47
00:04:01.534 --> 00:04:03.161
Setting foot in Trost
means a pointless death!

48
00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:04.913
Since we can't block the hole.

49
00:04:05.121 --> 00:04:07.373
defending Wall Rose's gate is
our only real option now!

50
00:04:07.582 --> 00:04:11.669
Damn it! They want glory that badly?!

51
00:04:12.337 --> 00:04:16.466
Back into that hell again...?

52
00:04:16.674 --> 00:04:18.509
No! I don't wanna die!

53
00:04:18.718 --> 00:04:20.345
Let me see my family!

54
00:04:20.553 --> 00:04:22.055
Hey. Daz! Not so loud!

55
00:04:22.263 --> 00:04:24.766
You. there! I heard that!

56
00:04:24.974 --> 00:04:26.935
Do you intend to abandon your duty?!

57
00:04:27.143 --> 00:04:28.269
Yes. I do!

58
00:04:28.478 --> 00:04:32.815
There's nothing to be had or gained
by this pointless act of mass suicide!

59
00:04:33.024 --> 00:04:37.153
What do you take humanity for?! Rules for?!

60
00:04:37.362 --> 00:04:41.240
It's within my authority to execute
you on the spot. you know!

61
00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:42.825
That's fine by me!

62
00:04:43.034 --> 00:04:46.120
It's a hundred times better
than getting eaten by Titans!

63
00:04:46.329 --> 00:04:47.497
Stop. Daz!

64
00:04:47.705 --> 00:04:49.791
Stop! Let go!

65
00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:52.543
I refuse to go back to that hellhole!

66
00:04:53.252 --> 00:04:54.963
Whoa. did you hear that?

67
00:04:55.171 --> 00:04:57.799
Can't say I blame him...

68
00:04:58.007 --> 00:05:01.177
Hey. do you think any
of us will be traitors too?

69
00:05:01.386 --> 00:05:03.972
I wish I could choose how I die...

70
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.515
You two!

71
00:05:05.723 --> 00:05:07.558
I-I was only joking!

72
00:05:07.767 --> 00:05:09.352
- Do it!
- Huh?

73
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.731
Make all sorts of noise!
With as many of you as possible!

74
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.235
Lots of us in the Garrison Regiment
are unhappy about this too!

75
00:05:17.443 --> 00:05:20.238
I'll use the commotion
to get out of here!

76
00:05:20.446 --> 00:05:23.366
To get out of here and go where?

77
00:05:23.574 --> 00:05:25.868
To see my daughter!

78
00:05:26.077 --> 00:05:29.205
They're gonna break
through this wall anyway!

79
00:05:30.623 --> 00:05:33.418
It's said that before
the Titans ruled the land.

80
00:05:33.626 --> 00:05:36.379
humankind consisted of people of
different races and creeds.

81
00:05:36.587 --> 00:05:41.259
and that they perpetually
fought with and killed each other.

82
00:05:41.467 --> 00:05:44.220
Supposedly someone back then said

83
00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:48.016
that if a powerful enemy
that wasn't human ever appeared.

84
00:05:48.224 --> 00:05:53.146
humanity would likely cease its
fighting and come together as one.

85
00:05:53.354 --> 00:05:55.273
What is your opinion?

86
00:05:55.481 --> 00:05:58.151
I'd never heard that story before.

87
00:05:58.359 --> 00:06:03.364
I'd say... it's a pretty laid-back attitude.
It's enough to make me yawn.

88
00:06:04.741 --> 00:06:08.453
You have a twisted mind. just like me.

89
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:12.582
Even now. when a powerful
enemy has driven us into a corner.

90
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.502
I would hardly say that we've "come together."

91
00:06:16.711 --> 00:06:17.503
Indeed.

92
00:06:17.712 --> 00:06:23.593
If we don't get our act together soon.
even fighting will be tough.

93
00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:31.768
Eren?!

94
00:06:32.685 --> 00:06:34.687
He's all right...

95
00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:39.067
Focus on my work?

96
00:06:39.275 --> 00:06:42.570
Who does that punk think he is.
bossing a superior officer around?

97
00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:47.158
Judging from his attitude.
Mikasa and Armin must be okay. too.

98
00:06:47.366 --> 00:06:48.826
Still...

99
00:06:49.035 --> 00:06:51.913
Why is he at the commander's side?

100
00:06:59.128 --> 00:07:00.755
Would you like some?

101
00:07:00.963 --> 00:07:02.840
Thank you. Sir!

102
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.559
Kill me! If you're gonna
execute me. just do it already!

103
00:07:13.768 --> 00:07:16.145
All right! Let's do it!

104
00:07:23.194 --> 00:07:25.613
Attention!

105
00:07:32.161 --> 00:07:37.250
I will now explain to you the details
of the Trost Recovery Operation!

106
00:07:37.458 --> 00:07:39.544
The objective of this operation

107
00:07:39.752 --> 00:07:44.298
is to seal the hole
in the demolished gate!

108
00:07:47.426 --> 00:07:48.970
Huh?

109
00:07:49.178 --> 00:07:52.974
Seal it? How?

110
00:07:53.182 --> 00:07:55.143
As for how we'll accomplish this.

111
00:07:55.351 --> 00:07:57.937
let me start by introducing this fellow!

112
00:07:58.146 --> 00:08:02.066
This is Eren Jaeger.
a member of the Cadets!

113
00:08:03.359 --> 00:08:05.987
E-Eren?!

114
00:08:06.195 --> 00:08:07.989
He is the successful result

115
00:08:08.197 --> 00:08:12.160
of our top-secret Titan
transformation experiments!

116
00:08:12.368 --> 00:08:19.125
He is able to fabricate a
Titan's body and control it at will!

117
00:08:20.835 --> 00:08:23.921
Uhh. the commander
isn't making much sense.

118
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.215
It's not just 'cause I'm stupid. right?!

119
00:08:26.424 --> 00:08:29.177
Just be quiet. You idiot.

120
00:08:30.094 --> 00:08:34.807
In Titan form. he will lift that
giant rock near the front gate.

121
00:08:35.016 --> 00:08:38.853
carry it to the wrecked gate.
and seal the hole!

122
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.190
As for you.

123
00:08:42.398 --> 00:08:48.279
you're to defend him from the other
Titans while he carries the rock!

124
00:08:48.487 --> 00:08:50.656
There's no need to <i>fight</i> the Titans?!

125
00:08:50.865 --> 00:08:53.534
I-I'm sorry!
I didn't mean to interrupt!

126
00:08:53.743 --> 00:08:55.328
I know I'm just a Cadet...

127
00:08:55.536 --> 00:08:57.955
That's okay. Continue.

128
00:08:58.164 --> 00:08:59.207
Right.

129
00:08:59.415 --> 00:09:03.878
Normally. Titans respond to large
groups of people by pursuing them.

130
00:09:04.086 --> 00:09:08.633
So if we were to use a large group
to lure them to the edge of the wall.

131
00:09:08.841 --> 00:09:14.055
I believe we could draw the Titans away
from Eren without having to fight.

132
00:09:14.263 --> 00:09:16.724
Additionally. once these
Titans have been lured away.

133
00:09:16.933 --> 00:09:20.478
we could take them out with
cannons without incurring any casualties.

134
00:09:20.686 --> 00:09:24.482
However. we can't afford
to leave Eren defenseless.

135
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.069
so a small squad of elite soldiers
would need to go and protect him.

136
00:09:28.277 --> 00:09:32.531
Plus. there's no avoiding any
Titans that come through the hole.

137
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.534
The elite squad will need to
be able to handle them.

138
00:09:35.743 --> 00:09:39.247
All right. then.
We'll rethink the plan around that.

139
00:09:39.455 --> 00:09:42.250
However. this is all
based on the assumption

140
00:09:42.458 --> 00:09:45.878
that Eren can pick up
the rock and seal the hole.

141
00:09:46.087 --> 00:09:49.882
I must admit I have my
doubts about carrying out this plan

142
00:09:50.091 --> 00:09:52.468
with so little assurance to go on...

143
00:09:52.677 --> 00:09:57.765
Indeed. I have misgivings about
sending so many people to their deaths

144
00:09:57.974 --> 00:10:00.351
based entirely on one big "if."

145
00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:03.354
but I understand
Commander Pyxis' assessment too.

146
00:10:03.562 --> 00:10:06.691
Yes. One of the issues is time.

147
00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:10.611
As we speak.
Titans continue to pour into the town.

148
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.863
The more filled the town gets.

149
00:10:13.072 --> 00:10:16.033
the worse our chances of
successfully retaking it become.

150
00:10:16.242 --> 00:10:21.539
And the chances of them breaking
through Wall Rose go up. too.

151
00:10:21.747 --> 00:10:23.582
And there's one other issue...

152
00:10:25.126 --> 00:10:30.298
People can only be
driven by fear for so long.

153
00:10:32.174 --> 00:10:34.552
He's going to pick up
that humongous rock?!

154
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.637
Is that really possible...?

155
00:10:36.846 --> 00:10:39.432
Has humankind finally
surmounted the Titans?!

156
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.725
you're lying!

157
00:10:40.933 --> 00:10:44.603
I refuse to give my life
for this ridiculous nonsense!

158
00:10:44.812 --> 00:10:47.064
What do you take us for?!

159
00:10:47.273 --> 00:10:50.985
We're not disposable blades. you know!

160
00:10:51.193 --> 00:10:54.071
- He says he's a human weapon!
- He's obviously just lying!

161
00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.072
Treatin' us like fools...!

162
00:10:55.281 --> 00:10:58.951
I ain't gonna die here today!
I'm outta here!

163
00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:03.331
M-Me too!

164
00:11:03.539 --> 00:11:04.540
Me too!

165
00:11:04.749 --> 00:11:05.916
Count me out. too!

166
00:11:06.125 --> 00:11:09.670
Wait! Don't make me execute you!

167
00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:13.549
I'm going to spend humanity's
final moments with my family!

168
00:11:13.758 --> 00:11:15.009
This isn't good.

169
00:11:15.217 --> 00:11:19.055
Indeed. We'll lose all order if
we don't do something.

170
00:11:19.263 --> 00:11:21.974
Prepare yourselves. lousy traitors!

171
00:11:22.183 --> 00:11:24.560
I'll cut you down where you stand!

172
00:11:26.187 --> 00:11:28.105
By my order...

173
00:11:28.314 --> 00:11:31.650
...all who leave now
are absolved of their crime!

174
00:11:33.569 --> 00:11:35.946
Those who've succumbed
to the Titans' terror once before

175
00:11:36.155 --> 00:11:38.866
can never face them again!

176
00:11:39.075 --> 00:11:43.454
Anyone who has already
experienced their horror may leave!

177
00:11:43.662 --> 00:11:48.876
And. those who want
their family and loved ones

178
00:11:49.085 --> 00:11:52.004
to experience that same horror

179
00:11:52.213 --> 00:11:54.048
may leave as well!

180
00:12:01.806 --> 00:12:03.432
Daddy!

181
00:12:05.059 --> 00:12:07.937
Anything but that...

182
00:12:08.145 --> 00:12:10.272
My daughter is...

183
00:12:12.191 --> 00:12:15.486
...all the hope I have left!

184
00:12:17.446 --> 00:12:20.074
Let's discuss four years ago!

185
00:12:20.282 --> 00:12:23.285
Namely. the operation to
retake Wall Maria!

186
00:12:23.494 --> 00:12:26.831
I'm sure none of this needs saying!

187
00:12:27.957 --> 00:12:30.626
Calling it a "recovery operation"
gave it a nice ring.

188
00:12:30.835 --> 00:12:33.629
but it was essentially a way to
dispose of the unemployed masses

189
00:12:33.838 --> 00:12:36.966
that the government couldn't support!

190
00:12:38.384 --> 00:12:41.303
The reason no one has spoken out about it

191
00:12:41.512 --> 00:12:44.014
is because sending them outside

192
00:12:44.223 --> 00:12:49.311
is what has allowed <i>us</i> to survive
inside these cramped walls!

193
00:12:52.565 --> 00:12:56.694
All of humanity-myself included-is guilty!

194
00:12:56.902 --> 00:12:58.696
Conflict never arose

195
00:12:58.904 --> 00:13:02.658
simply because Wall Maria's
citizens were in the minority!

196
00:13:02.867 --> 00:13:05.286
But what about now?!

197
00:13:05.494 --> 00:13:07.580
If Wall Rose falls.

198
00:13:07.788 --> 00:13:11.709
humanity will lose much
more than 20% of its population!

199
00:13:12.877 --> 00:13:18.174
Wall Sina wouldn't be able to support
even half of the people still alive!

200
00:13:18.382 --> 00:13:24.472
If we humans go extinct. it won't be
because we were eaten by Titans!

201
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.893
It'll be because we killed ourselves off!

202
00:13:29.101 --> 00:13:33.063
We cannot afford to
die any further inside.

203
00:13:33.898 --> 00:13:35.774
I kindly ask of you!

204
00:13:35.983 --> 00:13:37.985
Please die here!

205
00:13:45.951 --> 00:13:51.248
I don't know if I can lift that rock
with my Titan ability or not.

206
00:13:51.457 --> 00:13:55.377
But I understand what my role is.

207
00:13:55.586 --> 00:14:01.842
Even if it's false. I have to succeed.

208
00:14:02.718 --> 00:14:05.721
I have to serve...

209
00:14:07.306 --> 00:14:10.809
...as everyone's hope!

210
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.742
Looks like you're all here.

211
00:14:26.951 --> 00:14:29.286
You have but one mission:

212
00:14:29.495 --> 00:14:31.789
to protect Eren Jaeger

213
00:14:31.997 --> 00:14:35.876
and eliminate any risks
that arise during the operation.

214
00:14:36.085 --> 00:14:38.546
It will probably be the most
dangerous and difficult mission

215
00:14:38.754 --> 00:14:40.798
of the entire operation.

216
00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:44.385
It's no exaggeration to
say that how you fare out there

217
00:14:44.593 --> 00:14:47.221
will decide the fate of all humankind.

218
00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:49.932
Sir. May I ask a question?

219
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.392
What is it?

220
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.187
Are you really sure about
this "human weapon" of yours?

221
00:14:55.396 --> 00:14:56.564
Quit it. Rico.

222
00:14:56.772 --> 00:14:58.524
You have your doubts too. don't you?

223
00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:00.317
Sir.

224
00:15:00.526 --> 00:15:05.656
This plan is based entirely on the
incredible uncertainty that is Eren Jaeger.

225
00:15:05.864 --> 00:15:10.703
If he doesn't do as planned.
many soldiers will die for nothing!

226
00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.122
Troubling. indeed.

227
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:17.084
Are you that fond of losing to the Titans?

228
00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.878
Personally. I hate it.

229
00:15:20.087 --> 00:15:23.632
I hate losing more than anything else.

230
00:15:23.841 --> 00:15:28.887
But. astonishingly enough. I've been
on the losing side for all my life.

231
00:15:31.223 --> 00:15:33.851
I want to win against the Titans.

232
00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:38.439
I want to prevail over those oafs.
no matter what it takes.

233
00:15:38.647 --> 00:15:41.525
N-No. we feel the same way. Sir!

234
00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:45.195
Then the only option is
to take a gamble on him.

235
00:15:45.404 --> 00:15:49.491
Because what you call
"an incredible uncertainty"

236
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:53.621
is our one and only chance of
achieving victory over the Titans.

237
00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.833
Sir. It's time for the
decoy operation to begin.

238
00:15:58.042 --> 00:15:59.460
Mm.

239
00:16:00.628 --> 00:16:02.421
Ian Dietrich.

240
00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:04.006
Rico Brzenska.

241
00:16:04.214 --> 00:16:05.758
Mitabi Jarnach.

242
00:16:05.966 --> 00:16:10.262
You are the very best of the
best of the Garrison Regiment.

243
00:16:11.263 --> 00:16:13.891
The fate of humanity is in your hands.

244
00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:15.267
Sir!

245
00:16:15.476 --> 00:16:18.520
Ian. You'll lead the squad.

246
00:16:18.729 --> 00:16:21.065
I leave all on-site
decision-making to you.

247
00:16:21.273 --> 00:16:24.401
Huh? Me. Sir?

248
00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:27.029
- I have no objections.
- Neither do I.

249
00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:29.406
But. Sir. I don't feel competent enough...!

250
00:16:29.615 --> 00:16:31.033
Never fear.

251
00:16:32.034 --> 00:16:33.702
You have an understanding of alcohol.

252
00:16:33.911 --> 00:16:35.245
Sir...?

253
00:16:35.454 --> 00:16:38.957
You can discern when
a drink is good. bad. or both.

254
00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.669
So I leave it to you.

255
00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:44.129
Yes. Sir!

256
00:16:45.047 --> 00:16:47.383
Eren. I'm sorry.

257
00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:52.179
I didn't mean to force all the responsibility
onto your shoulders like this.

258
00:16:52.388 --> 00:16:54.014
I told you before. remember?

259
00:16:54.223 --> 00:16:57.351
You have the ability to make the right call.

260
00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:59.144
I have faith in that.

261
00:16:59.353 --> 00:17:02.439
- Eren. I really think I should...
- Don't even think of coming with me.

262
00:17:03.482 --> 00:17:06.068
They assigned you to the decoy squad.

263
00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:08.779
But I can't leave you all alone!

264
00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:09.863
It'll happen again if...

265
00:17:10.072 --> 00:17:11.824
Enough. already!

266
00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:16.495
I told you before! I'm not your
little brother or your kid!

267
00:17:18.997 --> 00:17:20.416
Ackermann.

268
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.211
Join the elite squad that'll protect Jaeger.

269
00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:27.172
We'll need your skills.

270
00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:30.300
Let's go. It's time to begin!

271
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.638
See you. Armin. Don't die. you hear?

272
00:17:34.847 --> 00:17:36.849
Mm. You too. Eren.

273
00:17:50.612 --> 00:17:52.948
He called you a top-secret human weapon.

274
00:17:53.157 --> 00:17:55.075
but as long as you can
seal that hole. I don't care!

275
00:17:55.284 --> 00:17:57.077
We'll protect you at all costs!

276
00:17:57.286 --> 00:17:58.287
We're counting on you!

277
00:17:58.495 --> 00:17:59.913
Right!

278
00:18:00.706 --> 00:18:02.416
Eren. Are you all right?

279
00:18:02.624 --> 00:18:04.042
Yeah!

280
00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:07.838
- Eren.
- Seriously. I'm fine!

281
00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:10.424
I'm much better than
when we were surrounded!

282
00:18:10.632 --> 00:18:12.926
Quit playing house. Jaeger!

283
00:18:13.135 --> 00:18:14.887
It isn't like that!

284
00:18:15.095 --> 00:18:17.181
I can't believe the fate of mankind

285
00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:20.434
rests in the hands of
a coddled brat like you...

286
00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.978
That's enough. all of you!

287
00:18:23.187 --> 00:18:25.439
We're almost to the
shortest route to the rock.

288
00:18:26.565 --> 00:18:29.026
I don't see any Titans in the area.

289
00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:31.528
Their decoy tactic must be working.

290
00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:38.619
Listen! All we have to do is
lure them into a corner of town!

291
00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:40.829
Avoid any unnecessary fighting!

292
00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.501
Just so you're aware. Jaeger...

293
00:18:46.627 --> 00:18:51.632
More than just a few soldiers
will likely die during this operation.

294
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.467
All for you.

295
00:18:55.135 --> 00:19:00.265
Our colleagues.
our seniors. and our juniors.

296
00:19:00.474 --> 00:19:04.186
They're prepared to die.
of course. They're soldiers.

297
00:19:04.394 --> 00:19:08.232
But. they aren't faceless pawns.

298
00:19:11.527 --> 00:19:12.945
Steady!

299
00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:17.825
Not yet!

300
00:19:19.034 --> 00:19:20.452
Almost...!

301
00:19:22.621 --> 00:19:24.248
Break away!

302
00:19:25.791 --> 00:19:31.672
They have names. families.
and hopes and dreams of their own.

303
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.675
Alyosha. Dominic. Fine.

304
00:19:34.883 --> 00:19:37.845
Isabel. Ludwig. Martina.

305
00:19:38.053 --> 00:19:39.680
Guido. Hans.

306
00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:43.684
They're all real people.
flesh and blood.

307
00:19:43.892 --> 00:19:47.980
Some have been living under
the same roof since their cadet days.

308
00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:54.236
And many of these people
could end up dying for you today.

309
00:19:54.444 --> 00:20:00.075
It's your duty to make
sure their deaths aren't in vain.

310
00:20:00.284 --> 00:20:02.202
Regardless of what happens.

311
00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:05.706
Keep that in your pampered mind

312
00:20:05.914 --> 00:20:09.251
and fulfill your duty
with dead seriousness.

313
00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:10.878
I will!

314
00:20:11.628 --> 00:20:15.507
I'm gonna do this!
I absolutely <i>will</i> succeed!

315
00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:22.180
Not once has humanity ever
achieved victory over the Titans

316
00:20:22.389 --> 00:20:24.600
since they first appeared!

317
00:20:25.851 --> 00:20:27.644
For every step the
Titans have taken forward.

318
00:20:27.853 --> 00:20:32.941
humanity has continually been forced
to draw back and give up its territory!

319
00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:37.195
However. should this operation succeed.

320
00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:42.576
humanity will have taken back land
from the Titans for the very first time!

321
00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.621
This is the spot! Let's go!

322
00:20:46.872 --> 00:20:53.295
It will be the first time humankind
has achieved victory over the Titans!

323
00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.724
Green smoke shell sighted!

324
00:21:05.933 --> 00:21:08.769
Elite Squad has commenced operation!

325
00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:13.315
Indeed. it may seem extraordinarily small

326
00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:18.779
when compared to what
humanity has given up this far!

327
00:21:18.987 --> 00:21:20.364
However!

328
00:21:20.572 --> 00:21:24.076
For humankind. that single. small step...

329
00:21:24.284 --> 00:21:26.828
...will be a great leap forward!

330
00:21:57.567 --> 00:22:00.112
In terms of body proportion.

331
00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.323
it's hard to believe he'll
be able to pick up that rock.

332
00:22:03.532 --> 00:22:08.537
But I'm sure Eren has the
great strength to lead us forward.

333
00:22:15.961 --> 00:22:17.379
Eren?

334
00:22:37.482 --> 00:22:42.404
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

335
00:22:42.612 --> 00:22:48.660
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

336
00:22:48.869 --> 00:22:53.331
<i>Over and over you cast them aside.
only to find more</i>

337
00:22:53.540 --> 00:23:00.005
<i>Now. rest in peace</i>

338
00:23:00.213 --> 00:23:11.349
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

339
00:23:11.558 --> 00:23:21.610
<i>and the more we forget
the more we remember again</i>

340
00:23:21.818 --> 00:23:27.574
<i>In this beautiful. cruel world</i>

341
00:23:27.783 --> 00:23:32.746
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

342
00:23:32.954 --> 00:23:38.460
<i>Oh. with our strength... and our weakness...</i>

343
00:23:38.668 --> 00:23:44.132
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

344
00:23:44.341 --> 00:23:47.761
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

345
00:23:54.142 --> 00:23:57.521
The Trost Recovery Operation has begun.

346
00:23:57.729 --> 00:23:59.856
As countless soldiers meet their deaths.

347
00:24:00.065 --> 00:24:02.109
Eren goes on a rampage in Titan form

348
00:24:02.317 --> 00:24:04.236
and destroys his own head.

349
00:24:04.444 --> 00:24:07.781
But. just when it seems the
operation has ended in failure...

9999
00:00:0.500 --> 00:00:2.00
