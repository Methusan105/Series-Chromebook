00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.810
Answer the man. scum.

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.500
What do you want to do?

3
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.389
I want to join the Recon Corps.

4
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.820
and kill as many Titans as I can. sir!

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.120
Oh? Not bad.

6
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.590
Erwin. I'll take responsibility for him.

7
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.260
Tell that to the higher-ups.

8
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.079
Don't get me wrong. It's not like I trust him.

9
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.239
If he betrays us or goes berserk.
I'll put him down without hesitation.

10
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.419
Upstairs shouldn't have a problem with that...

11
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.019
Nobody except me is suited for the job.

12
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.170
I'll accept your application
to the Recon Corps.

30
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.990
Can't Look Into His Eyes- Prelude
to the Counterattack (pt 1)

31
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.049
Hey. is it true?

32
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.579
Are there really Titans that sided with us?

33
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.689
Come on. it's obviously just a rumor.

34
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.368
The retake campaign might've
failed. meaning lots

35
00:02:48.393 --> 00:02:51.100
of people from Wall Rose
could be evacuating here.

36
00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:54.019
Inside Wall Sina

37
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.019
But then we're bound to have
another food shortage...

38
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.249
What if the Titan that sided with
humans joins up with the Rose refugees.

39
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.770
and they attack us together?

40
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:07.690
Wall Rose

41
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.309
Wall Sina

42
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.285
This is huge news! A Titan has sided with us!

43
00:03:11.286 --> 00:03:12.679
Inside Wall Rose

44
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.599
We might even be able to retake Wall Maria!

45
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.679
Say it!

46
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.260
Say it! He's our savior!

47
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.010
Savior. huh?

48
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.940
The common folk are always so irresponsible.

49
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.939
They might even try to using him to incite
rebellion against the Inner District.

50
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.280
As the Police. we must dispose of
Eren Jaeger before that can happen.

51
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.120
We won't let those freaks at the
Recon Corps get their hands on him.

52
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.620
Attention!

53
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.240
Salute the Supreme Commander!

54
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.900
It's hot.

55
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.599
Commander Pixis.

56
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.690
some people consider it inappropriate
for you. as Commander of the Garrison.

57
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.810
to be conversing privately with
someone like me from the Recon Corps.

58
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.709
Hm. you're as stiff as they say.

59
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.650
We merely ran into each other by
chance during our morning walks.

60
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.419
Now that we're already walking.
we might as well chat.

61
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.299
Have you heard that the Police
are also after Eren Jaeger?

62
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.639
Yes. They sent word yesterday.

63
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.620
A trial will be held.

64
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.849
The decision about whether the
Police or the Recon Corps get Eren

65
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.839
has been entrusted to Zacklay.

66
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.489
Zacklay?

67
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.560
Do you mean Supreme Commander Dallis Zacklay?

68
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.638
He's the man in charge
of all three forces: the

69
00:05:00.663 --> 00:05:03.844
Military Police. the Garrison.
and the Recon Corps.

70
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.209
When making decisions. he
considers only one method:

71
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.039
the cost-benefit analysis.

72
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.009
That is. whether it's profitable
or harmful to mankind overall.

73
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.579
Which means he wouldn't hesitate
to execute Eren right on the spot.

74
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.460
if that were the verdict.

75
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.759
I don't want to let him kill Eren.

76
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:29.979
But unfortunately. more than a few
in my Garrison fear Eren's powers.

77
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.500
All I can do is to argue my
case against the Police.

78
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.000
Do you think you can win?

79
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.380
Yes.

80
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.780
I have also prepared a proposition.

81
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.630
but its viability depends greatly
on the way the trial progresses.

82
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.469
So you're planning to go in cold?

83
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.920
We of the Recon Corps are used to getting
chills from our work outside the Walls.

84
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.510
You aren't as stiff as you seem.

85
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.370
Thank you for such a nice
stroll. Colonel Smith.

86
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.709
Eren's being put on trial? For what?

87
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.189
I don't know the details.

88
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.579
I think it's about deciding
how to deal with Eren.

89
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.299
What does that mean?

90
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.610
They're probably deciding
whether he lives or dies.

91
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.379
Mikasa Ackerman! Armin Arlert!

92
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.200
Are you here?

93
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.500
Yes. sir!

94
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.580
You have been ordered to appear at the
trial this afternoon as witnesses!

95
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.799
Excuse me. May I use the toilet?

96
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.220
You just went earlier.

97
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.189
Can I get some water?

98
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.279
Hey! Understand the situation you're in.

99
00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.610
Damn monster.

100
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.340
Monster? I guess they're not wrong about that.

101
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.290
Am I so scary that they need
to restrain me this much?

102
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.410
I shouldn't be that surprised. I don't
really understand all this myself.

103
00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.630
I should just be happy that
I haven't been killed yet.

104
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.010
Wait a minute.

105
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.890
Those two weren't scared of me at all.

106
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.660
What are they doing now?

107
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.420
What happened to everybody else?

108
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.960
Be patient for a little longer.

109
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.359
We'll try to sort things out.

110
00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.000
How many days have passed since then?

111
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.759
What's going on outside?

112
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.240
I won't have to live my whole
life like this. right?

113
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.589
So you're Eren. huh?

114
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.899
You okay? Feeling filthy?

115
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.259
Sorry for making you wait for so long.

116
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.150
You can finally leave this place.

117
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.090
Though you'll have to wear these.

118
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:41.279
I'm from the Recon Corps. Major Hanji Zoe.

119
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.799
He's fellow Major Mike Zacharias.

120
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.059
Um...

121
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:50.052
Ah. he just has this habit
of sniffing people at

122
00:08:50.077 --> 00:08:53.824
their first meeting.
then laughing like that.

123
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.419
I wouldn't read much into it though.

124
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.940
He's skilled enough to
become a major. after all.

125
00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:10.020
Oh. we chatted all the time away.
We're already here.

126
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:15.280
Well. I guess you're better off
without an explanation too.

127
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.329
We don't have a choice

128
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.880
but to trust you blindly.

129
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:24.660
Good luck.

130
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.340
A courtroom?

131
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:45.419
So I was being held under the courthouse?

132
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.310
Move along!

133
00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:47.970
Currently Disclosable
Information:

134
00:09:47.995 --> 00:09:50.156
Special court-martial (pt 1): A court for
judging those of military affiliation.

135
00:09:50.181 --> 00:09:51.900
The judge. the prosecution. and
the defense are all soldiers too.

136
00:09:51.903 --> 00:09:53.132
Currently Disclosable
Information:

137
00:09:53.157 --> 00:09:55.434
Special court-martial (2): This proceeding has a lot
more political undertones than normal court-martials.

138
00:09:55.459 --> 00:09:56.892
The final decision is handed down by the head of the
three forces. Supreme Commander Dallis Zacklay.

139
00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.120
Kneel down there.

140
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.139
Why are these people here?

141
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.710
What is this trial even about?

142
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.370
Guys!

143
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.650
Now then. let us begin.

144
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:36.089
You are Eren Jaeger. right?

145
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:40.939
You're a soldier who vowed to
devote his life to the King.

146
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.619
Is that correct?

147
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.119
Yes. sir.

148
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.009
This is an exceptional case.

149
00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.001
It is outside the
bounds of common law.

150
00:10:48.026 --> 00:10:50.539
therefore we must convene
a special court-martial.

151
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.999
The final decision will be handed down by me.

152
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.379
We will deliberate upon whether
you live or die as well.

153
00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.009
I knew it.

154
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.680
Do you have any objections?

155
00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.509
None. sir.

156
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.819
I'm glad you're so cooperative.

157
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.690
Let me say this straightforwardly.

158
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:14.959
Concealing your existence
has proven impossible.

159
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.669
Unless we publicize your
existence in some way.

160
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:22.499
we will have to face another
threat besides the Titans.

161
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:27.590
This court is tasked with deciding
which force will take custody of you.

162
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:32.470
the Military Police or the Recon Corps.

163
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:36.879
First. let us hear the
proposition from the Police.

164
00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:42.329
I am Nile Dawk. Chief of the Military Police.
Our proposition is as follows:

165
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:47.129
We will examine Eren's body thoroughly.

166
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.150
then dispose of him as soon as possible.

167
00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.569
It's a fact that his Titan power
repelled the last attack.

168
00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:02.080
However. his character induces disturbances
that may even lead to a rebellion.

169
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:07.049
Therefore he shall provide us with
as much intelligence as possible.

170
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:09.930
then he'll become a martyr for mankind.

171
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.210
That isn't necessary.

172
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.579
He's a vermin that breached and
infiltrated the sacred Walls of God.

173
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.539
He's from the Church of the Walls.

174
00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.700
Five years ago no one
even took them seriously.

175
00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.219
He should be killed here and now!

176
00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.699
Priest Nick. quiet. please.

177
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.390
They've come a long way.

178
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:27.889
Next. let us hear the proposition
from the Recon Corps.

179
00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:28.640
Yes. sir.

180
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:35.349
I am Colonel Erwin Smith. head of the Thirteenth Battalion
of the Recon Corps. Our proposition is as follows:

181
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:39.969
We will accept Eren as a formal
member of the Recon Corps.

182
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.160
and recapture Wall Maria
by using his Titan power.

183
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.410
That is all.

184
00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:50.729
Is that it?

185
00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:55.719
Yes. Using his abilities.
we can retake Wall Maria.

186
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.930
I believe the priorities are clearly apparent.

187
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.019
I see.

188
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:06.179
By the way. from where do you
intend to launch that operation?

189
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:11.479
Pixis. I believe the gate at
Trost was sealed for good.

190
00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:15.190
Yeah. It'll probably never be opened again.

191
00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.660
We would like to start
from Calanes in the east.

192
00:13:18.661 --> 00:13:21.235
Trost

193
00:13:21.236 --> 00:13:24.110
Calanes

194
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.565
Shiganshina

195
00:13:21.566 --> 00:13:24.409
We will approach Shiganshina on a new route.

196
00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:29.159
Wait! Shouldn't we seal all the gates now?

197
00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.899
The Colossal Titan can only destroy the gates!

198
00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.579
If we fortify those areas. they
won't be able to attack us again!

199
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.849
Shut up. you puppet of the traders' guild!

200
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:43.139
Using that Titan strength. we can
return to Wall Maria once again!

201
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.069
We're fed up with you
playing hero all the time!

202
00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.890
You talk a lot. pig.

203
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:55.269
Who says the Titans will wait until
you can lock up all the gates?

204
00:13:55.270 --> 00:14:01.030
When you say "we". are you referring to your
little friends who you plan to get fat with?

205
00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:07.979
Can't you even see that people are starving
because we don't have enough land?

206
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:12.299
We're only suggesting that if we
sealed the gates. we'd be saf...

207
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.389
Enough of your insolence!

208
00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.698
How dare you even suggest doing such
a thing to the sacred Wall Rose.

209
00:14:18.723 --> 00:14:19.825
given unto us by God?!

210
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.739
You look upon the greatness of the Walls.
which transcends human understanding.

211
00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:25.660
and you still can't see?!

212
00:14:25.661 --> 00:14:30.139
It was their fault that it took so long
to fortify the defenses of the Walls...

213
00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:34.020
They have the money and the power.

214
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.269
You speak blasphemy!

215
00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.409
This is no place for a priest to speak!

216
00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:39.280
What?!

217
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:43.509
Silence.

218
00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:47.729
Argue about your individual beliefs
and opinions somewhere else.

219
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.979
Jaeger. let me ask you this:

220
00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.669
Can you keep fighting for the
sake of mankind as a soldier.

221
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:57.499
and also use your Titan
power for the same goal?

222
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.719
Yes! I can.

223
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.819
Oh?

224
00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:06.109
But in the report from Trost it says:

225
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:11.480
"He swung his fist at Mikasa Ackerman
right after becoming a Titan."

226
00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:16.980
He doesn't remember that he lost control?

227
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.779
You want me to lie in a report?

228
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.669
Mankind gains nothing from hiding such a fact.

229
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.449
Is Mikasa Ackerman here?

230
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.160
Yes. I am.

231
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.119
You. huh?

232
00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.000
Is it true that after he
transformed. Jaeger attacked you?

233
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:39.590
You must tell the truth. For Eren's sake.

234
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:47.180
Yes. it is true.

235
00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.890
Titans are Titans after all!

236
00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:55.249
I tried to kill Mikasa?!

237
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.490
I did?

238
00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:04.669
But before that. he also saved my
life twice while in Titan form.

239
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:05.530
The first time.

240
00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.369
when I was about to fall prey to a Titan.

241
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.500
he fought them off and defended me.

242
00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:15.939
The second time.

243
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.520
he protected me and Armin from cannon fire.

244
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:24.059
I entreat you to consider these facts as well.

245
00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:25.470
Wait a moment.

246
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.470
I believe this testimony is too
emotionally-biased to be accepted in court.

247
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:38.190
Mikasa Ackerman lost her parents at a young
age. and she was taken in by Jaeger's family.

248
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:46.290
However. we uncovered some surprising
details regarding those events.

249
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:52.049
Eren Jaeger and Mikasa Ackerman
were nine years old at the time.

250
00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:55.880
They murdered all three robber-kidnappers.

251
00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.259
You might call this justifiable self-defense.

252
00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.339
but I can't help but feel disturbed by the
fundamental lack of humanity in their actions.

253
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:09.969
Can we really trust him with the fate.
funds. and manpower of mankind?

254
00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:14.769
Yeah! He's probably a Titan who
infiltrated us disguised as a child!

255
00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:16.020
Her too!

256
00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:19.099
How can we be sure she's human?

257
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.649
That's right! We should
dissect her just in case!

258
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:26.899
Wait! Maybe I am a monster. but
she has nothing to do with that!

259
00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.189
Nothing at all!

260
00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:29.589
As if we could believe you!

261
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:30.170
It's a fact!

262
00:17:30.171 --> 00:17:32.079
You're defending her? She must be one of you!

263
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:32.740
No!

264
00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.259
You're wrong.

265
00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:46.880
You keep using mere speculation just
to make the water flow your way.

266
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.759
W-What?!

267
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:54.460
First off. you've never even seen a Titan!

268
00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.600
This isn't good.

269
00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.270
So why are you so afraid?

270
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.850
I should shut up.

271
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.939
No. I'm gonna say it all.

272
00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.860
I'll tell them what I think!

273
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:08.280
If those with strength don't fight. who will?

274
00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:13.580
If you're too scared to fight for your
lives. then at least don't hinder me!

275
00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.489
You cowards.

276
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:17.619
What?!

277
00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:21.660
Just shut up and let me shoulder it all!

278
00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:28.560
Ready!

279
00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.650
Wait. Mikasa!

280
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.269
It's just my personal opinion.

281
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.720
but pain is the best tool for discipline.

282
00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:03.899
You don't need to be educated by words.

283
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.040
You need training.

284
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.050
You've fallen low enough that
you're easy to kick around. anyway.

285
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.560
Hold on. Levi...

286
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:22.140
What?

287
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.190
It's dangerous.

288
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:28.730
What if he starts raging
and turns into a Titan?

289
00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:32.860
What are you talking about?

290
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.530
I thought you were going to dissect him.

291
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.087
As I heard it. when he
turned into a Titan. he

292
00:19:42.112 --> 00:19:45.579
killed 20 other Titans
before his strength ran out.

293
00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:49.819
If he were an enemy. he might cause
more trouble than that intel's worth.

294
00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.090
He still can't stand against me though.

295
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.759
What about you on the other hand?

296
00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.939
All of you who persecute him. think it over.

297
00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.770
Can you really kill him?

298
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.890
Supreme Commander. I have a proposal.

299
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:06.480
What is it?

300
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:12.069
Eren's Titan power has a multitude of
uncertainties and unknown elements.

301
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:13.900
It is exceedingly dangerous.

302
00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.659
So why don't we put Eren
under Captain Levi's command

303
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.599
and send them on a mission outside the Walls?

304
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.839
Eren as well?

305
00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.939
Yes.

306
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.790
Whether Eren can control his Titan power.

307
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:31.219
and whether he may be of benefit to mankind.

308
00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.799
should be decided based on
the results of that mission.

309
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.309
Watch over Eren Jaeger...

310
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.550
Can you do that. Levi?

311
00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:43.299
I can definitely kill him.

312
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.980
The problem is it'll either be all or nothing.

313
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.610
I've made my decision.

314
00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:03.499
That was so mean of him. It must hurt a lot.

315
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.019
A little.

316
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.460
Where's the pain?

317
00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:13.799
Sorry about doing that. But as a
result. we got you for ourselves.

318
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.289
Yes.

319
00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:18.909
We were able to play our trump cards
at the most effective moments.

320
00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.890
Your pain was worth our gain.

321
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:23.890
Thank you.

322
00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.060
I look forward to working with you. Eren.

323
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.090
Likewise. sir!

324
00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.329
Say. Eren.

325
00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:36.819
Yes?

326
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.490
Do you hate me?

327
00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:42.869
No. I understand it was necessary.

328
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.099
Glad to hear.

329
00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.869
You could've at least held back a little.

330
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:48.500
You even broke his tooth.

331
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:49.740
Look.

332
00:21:49.741 --> 00:21:51.959
Don't pick that up. It's disgusting.

333
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.299
It's an important sample for me.

334
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.880
Eren. I bet you're glad you won't be
dissected by freaks like her. huh?

335
00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:00.809
Don't put me in the same league as them.

336
00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.640
I wouldn't kill Eren.

337
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:07.250
Hey. may I see the inside of your mouth?

338
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:19.110
His tooth... already grew back.

339
00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.460
Tatoeba ore ga oreja naitoshite

340
00:22:38.461 --> 00:22:41.119
If we suppose that I am not me.

341
00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.625
omae wa omaedato iikirerunoka

342
00:22:43.626 --> 00:22:46.129
Can you say with certainty that you are you?

343
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:48.895
Suna no utsuwa wo kowashite koboreta

344
00:22:48.896 --> 00:22:51.659
Will you be able to pick up after yourself

345
00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.208
- kokoro wo hirotte atsumerareruka
- Once your

346
00:22:54.233 --> 00:22:56.810
sand-like shell breaks
and your heart crumbles?

347
00:22:56.813 --> 00:22:59.415
Dareka no yobu koe ga

348
00:22:59.416 --> 00:23:02.019
I could hear someone calling

349
00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.970
miminari ni kawatta

350
00:23:03.971 --> 00:23:05.919
But now my ears are just ringing

351
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.500
toki ga tomatta mitaida

352
00:23:08.501 --> 00:23:11.079
It's as if time has frozen

353
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.535
saa me wo samase

354
00:23:12.536 --> 00:23:13.989
Now. wake up

355
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.475
fukai yami wo ore wa arukidashita

356
00:23:16.476 --> 00:23:18.959
I began to walk through a deep dark abyss

357
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.610
hayate mitai ni nigedashita

358
00:23:21.611 --> 00:23:24.259
As swift as a gale. I escaped for my life

359
00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.545
ikita shikabane mitaidatta

360
00:23:26.546 --> 00:23:28.829
I felt like a living corpse

361
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:31.395
oretachi wa kabe no soto e

362
00:23:31.396 --> 00:23:33.959
We break out of our walls

363
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.155
mata aouze chizu ni nai bashode

364
00:23:37.156 --> 00:23:40.350
To reunite in worlds we've yet to map

365
00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.710
Eren finally gets assigned to
the Recon Corps he so admired.

366
00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:00.239
He discovers it to be a group
of people who demand change.

367
00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.149
as well as a haven for freaks and weirdos.

368
00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:05.000
That is the Recon Corps.

369
00:24:05.001 --> 00:24:07.800
The Special Ops Squad

370
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.800
Prelude to the Counterattack (pt 2)

9999
00:00:0.500 --> 00:00:2.00
