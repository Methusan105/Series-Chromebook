00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.595
Over a century ago. beings that
prey on humans suddenly appeared.

2
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.605
Their absolutely overwhelming strength

3
00:00:20.814 --> 00:00:25.068
quickly pushed humanity to
the brink of extinction.

4
00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:35.495
The surviving humans constructed
three walls: Maria. Rose. and Sina.

5
00:00:35.704 --> 00:00:38.790
which brought them a century of peace.

6
00:00:38.998 --> 00:00:40.417
However...

7
00:00:41.334 --> 00:00:49.551
In the year 845. the Colossal Titan
and the Armored Titan suddenly appeared

8
00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:54.347
and destroyed one of humanity's
walls-and everyday life with it.

9
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:59.185
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria.

10
00:00:59.394 --> 00:01:03.148
lost twenty percent of its population
and one-third of its territory.

11
00:01:03.356 --> 00:01:08.069
and was forced to
retreat behind Wall Rose.

12
00:01:10.947 --> 00:01:18.580
In the year 850. the Colossal
Titan demolished another wall

13
00:01:18.788 --> 00:01:23.001
and allowed the Titans inside once again.

14
00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:24.419
Eren!

15
00:01:24.627 --> 00:01:26.045
Hurry!

16
00:01:32.677 --> 00:01:38.016
The entire populace was
evacuated two hours later.

17
00:01:38.224 --> 00:01:41.394
Not a single person was eaten by a Titan...

18
00:01:42.312 --> 00:01:48.151
...except for the soldiers who fended
them off and died in the line of duty.

19
00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:49.527
Eren.

20
00:01:49.736 --> 00:01:54.157
As long as I have you.
I can do anything.

21
00:02:09.297 --> 00:02:14.135
<i>Unknown are the names
of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

22
00:02:14.344 --> 00:02:19.599
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth
and long for the wind</i>

23
00:02:19.808 --> 00:02:24.687
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

24
00:02:24.896 --> 00:02:30.026
<i>Only the will to fight
can change the here and now!</i>

25
00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:35.323
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve
to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

26
00:02:35.532 --> 00:02:37.867
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

27
00:02:38.076 --> 00:02:40.745
<i>Give us the freedom of dying.
starving wolves!</i>

28
00:02:40.954 --> 00:02:46.125
<i>The humiliation of being caged
is what triggers us to fight back</i>

29
00:02:46.334 --> 00:02:51.422
<i>We hunters slaughter prey
beyond the castle walls.</i>

30
00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:56.636
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust.</i>

31
00:02:56.845 --> 00:03:03.768
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows
pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

32
00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:37.969
Please wait. Captain!

33
00:03:38.177 --> 00:03:39.971
Should the Titans attack.

34
00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:43.224
we supply soldiers won't be able
to hold this position on our own!

35
00:03:43.433 --> 00:03:45.935
Please. Sir! You have to stay here!

36
00:03:46.144 --> 00:03:47.812
Step aside.

37
00:03:48.021 --> 00:03:52.859
I <i>must</i> reorganize the
reinforcements now.

38
00:03:53.484 --> 00:03:56.738
Behind the safety of
the inner gate. you mean?

39
00:03:56.946 --> 00:03:59.282
What the hell are you trying to say?

40
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.326
I'll have you know I'm following regulations!

41
00:04:01.534 --> 00:04:04.954
Obeying established
regulations is a soldier's duty!

42
00:04:05.163 --> 00:04:07.123
B-But. Sir!
If we lose this position...!

43
00:04:07.332 --> 00:04:09.208
Enough of your talk!

44
00:04:10.668 --> 00:04:11.920
Open your mouth again

45
00:04:12.128 --> 00:04:16.257
and I'll be forced to punish
you for treason where you stand!

46
00:04:29.312 --> 00:04:32.690
Why isn't anyone going over the wall?

47
00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:35.401
I'm sure they heard the
bell signaling us to withdraw...

48
00:04:50.458 --> 00:04:53.211
It's all over...

49
00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.046
We're done for...

50
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:06.224
There!

51
00:05:06.432 --> 00:05:09.310
What good is that going to do?

52
00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:21.114
C'mon. Jean! What are we gonna do?!

53
00:05:21.322 --> 00:05:23.741
Ain't anything we can do...

54
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.202
They <i>finally</i> gave the order to withdraw.

55
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:29.163
but we don't have enough
gas to scale the wall...

56
00:05:29.372 --> 00:05:31.874
We're all gonna die now...

57
00:05:32.083 --> 00:05:34.752
All 'cause of those cowards...

58
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:36.754
You mean the supply soldiers?!

59
00:05:36.963 --> 00:05:40.008
What's happened to them?!
Were they wiped out?!

60
00:05:40.216 --> 00:05:42.844
Apparently they lost the will to fight.

61
00:05:43.052 --> 00:05:45.221
I can understand the feeling.

62
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.306
but abandoning
their duty to supply us

63
00:05:47.515 --> 00:05:50.101
so they can barricade
themselves inside Headquarters?

64
00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:52.562
And sure enough.
Titans have swarmed the place.

65
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.689
meaning we can't even
get gas for ourselves.

66
00:05:54.897 --> 00:05:56.691
In that case. it's sink or swim!

67
00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:59.402
We'll just have to
take out the Titans there!

68
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.532
Hanging around here's no different!
The Titans will just gather here too!

69
00:06:04.741 --> 00:06:08.703
We'll only use up what little gas we
have left if we keep running aimlessly!

70
00:06:08.911 --> 00:06:12.707
Once we lose our mobility.
we're really done for!

71
00:06:12.915 --> 00:06:16.502
You're actually using
your head for once. Conny.

72
00:06:16.711 --> 00:06:20.673
But do you really think we
have the manpower to pull that off?

73
00:06:20.882 --> 00:06:24.010
Most of the veteran members of
the vanguard have been wiped out.

74
00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:25.303
We're just cadets;

75
00:06:25.511 --> 00:06:29.515
who can possibly take charge of
a suicide mission like that?

76
00:06:29.724 --> 00:06:31.642
Even if someone could.

77
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:34.729
it's not like we'd stand a chance
against the Titans anyway.

78
00:06:34.937 --> 00:06:40.526
And the supply room's probably got
some that are three or four meters high.

79
00:06:40.735 --> 00:06:45.031
There's no way we could
get anything done in there.

80
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.534
It's hopeless?

81
00:06:48.743 --> 00:06:51.245
What a dull life this was.

82
00:06:51.454 --> 00:06:54.791
If I'd known this would happen.
I would've said something sooner.

83
00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:57.168
Come on. guys! Let's do it!

84
00:06:57.376 --> 00:06:58.503
Get up!

85
00:06:58.711 --> 00:07:02.006
If we all work together.
we're sure to succeed!

86
00:07:02.215 --> 00:07:04.258
I'll take the lead!

87
00:07:15.144 --> 00:07:17.271
Armin! Let's go...!

88
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.321
Reiner.

89
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.405
What now?

90
00:07:26.614 --> 00:07:29.909
Not yet. We have to let them gather first.

91
00:07:30.118 --> 00:07:31.744
It's no use...

92
00:07:32.328 --> 00:07:35.248
However you look at it.
we're not getting out of this city.

93
00:07:35.456 --> 00:07:37.750
We're all dead.

94
00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:41.254
I mean. I'm ready
to die and everything...

95
00:07:41.462 --> 00:07:45.633
It's just... what am I dying for?

96
00:07:45.842 --> 00:07:46.634
Mikasa!

97
00:07:46.843 --> 00:07:48.803
Weren't you with the rearguard?!

98
00:07:49.011 --> 00:07:50.429
Annie!

99
00:07:51.055 --> 00:07:52.932
I understand the gist of the situation.

100
00:07:53.141 --> 00:07:56.102
So I'm sorry for letting
my personal matters interfere...

101
00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.437
...but have you seen Eren's squad?

102
00:07:58.646 --> 00:08:01.691
I haven't. but some squads did
make it over the wall...

103
00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:04.569
Actually. we <i>did</i> find Armin over there.

104
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.738
Armin!

105
00:08:08.698 --> 00:08:10.241
Mikasa...

106
00:08:10.449 --> 00:08:14.579
No! I can't bring myself to face her!

107
00:08:14.787 --> 00:08:17.707
All I did was survive for
no good reason...

108
00:08:17.915 --> 00:08:20.126
If I'd known this would happen...

109
00:08:20.334 --> 00:08:23.337
...I would rather have
died with him then instead!

110
00:08:25.006 --> 00:08:25.840
Armin.

111
00:08:26.048 --> 00:08:29.677
You're not hurt. are you?
Are you all right?

112
00:08:35.558 --> 00:08:37.185
Where's Eren?

113
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.938
Armin?

114
00:08:52.325 --> 00:08:53.743
We...

115
00:08:55.328 --> 00:08:58.414
The cadets of Squad 34...

116
00:08:58.623 --> 00:09:00.208
Thomas Wagner...

117
00:09:00.416 --> 00:09:02.335
Nack Tierce...

118
00:09:02.543 --> 00:09:04.879
Milieus Zeremski...

119
00:09:05.087 --> 00:09:07.048
Mina Carolina...

120
00:09:07.256 --> 00:09:09.759
Eren Jaeger...

121
00:09:09.967 --> 00:09:11.552
These five members...

122
00:09:11.761 --> 00:09:14.430
...fulfilled their duties...

123
00:09:14.639 --> 00:09:17.266
...and died valiantly
on the field of battle!

124
00:09:20.102 --> 00:09:21.938
You can't be serious...

125
00:09:23.272 --> 00:09:26.442
So Squad 34 is basically gone...

126
00:09:26.651 --> 00:09:30.780
The same thing'll happen to
us if we try to take the Titans on...

127
00:09:30.988 --> 00:09:33.407
I'm sorry. Mikasa...

128
00:09:33.616 --> 00:09:37.036
It should've been me. not Eren...

129
00:09:37.245 --> 00:09:38.704
I...

130
00:09:38.913 --> 00:09:41.249
...wasn't able to do anything...!

131
00:09:41.832 --> 00:09:43.251
I'm sorry...

132
00:09:47.296 --> 00:09:48.714
Armin.

133
00:09:51.968 --> 00:09:53.427
Calm down.

134
00:09:53.636 --> 00:09:57.723
Now isn't the time to be emotional.

135
00:09:58.391 --> 00:10:00.017
Now get up.

136
00:10:01.477 --> 00:10:02.561
Marco.

137
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:05.314
If we eliminate the Titans
swarming around HQ.

138
00:10:05.523 --> 00:10:09.026
we can replenish our gas
supplies and get over the wall.

139
00:10:09.235 --> 00:10:10.361
Correct?

140
00:10:10.569 --> 00:10:12.613
Well. yeah...

141
00:10:12.822 --> 00:10:15.449
But even with your help.
there's just too many...

142
00:10:15.658 --> 00:10:16.742
I can handle them.

143
00:10:16.951 --> 00:10:18.369
Huh?!

144
00:10:18.786 --> 00:10:21.163
I'm strong.

145
00:10:21.372 --> 00:10:23.916
Stronger than all of you.

146
00:10:24.125 --> 00:10:25.835
I'm very strong.

147
00:10:26.043 --> 00:10:30.923
As such. I am capable of
annihilating the Titans there!

148
00:10:31.132 --> 00:10:33.801
Even if I have to go it alone.

149
00:10:34.468 --> 00:10:37.179
As for all of you.
you're not only unskilled.

150
00:10:37.388 --> 00:10:40.141
you're also cowards and wimps.

151
00:10:40.933 --> 00:10:42.727
You're a real disappointment.

152
00:10:42.935 --> 00:10:45.479
You can just stay here
and twiddle your thumbs.

153
00:10:45.688 --> 00:10:47.148
Twiddle and watch.

154
00:10:47.356 --> 00:10:50.484
Whoa. Mikasa!
What's gotten into you?!

155
00:10:50.693 --> 00:10:53.487
You're seriously gonna take
on all those Titans by yourself?!

156
00:10:53.696 --> 00:10:55.197
There's no way you can beat them!

157
00:10:55.406 --> 00:10:57.992
If I can't. then I'll die.
It's that simple.

158
00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:58.993
But...

159
00:10:59.201 --> 00:11:00.453
If I win. I'll live.

160
00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:03.622
And the only way to win is to fight!

161
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:05.708
Hey!

162
00:11:10.087 --> 00:11:13.215
Your way with words
is the real disappointment.

163
00:11:13.424 --> 00:11:16.469
You actually considered
that motivational...

164
00:11:16.677 --> 00:11:19.722
I blame you for this. Eren...!

165
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:24.101
Hey! Since when were we taught
to let our comrades fight alone?!

166
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.772
Or do you guys <i>want</i>
to end up as actual cowards?!

167
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.441
Never thought I'd hear him say that.

168
00:11:36.614 --> 00:11:41.118
Come on. you cowards.
weaklings. and morons!

169
00:11:41.327 --> 00:11:42.453
Those guys...

170
00:11:42.661 --> 00:11:44.038
Damn it...

171
00:11:44.246 --> 00:11:47.083
All right. let's do it!

172
00:11:54.757 --> 00:11:55.841
Hurry!

173
00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:57.676
Follow Mikasa!

174
00:11:57.885 --> 00:11:59.220
Fight as little as possible!

175
00:11:59.428 --> 00:12:02.014
Get to HQ before you run out of gas!

176
00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.518
Man. Mikasa's incredible...

177
00:12:05.726 --> 00:12:08.145
How can she move so fast?!

178
00:12:08.354 --> 00:12:11.273
No! She's using up too much gas!

179
00:12:11.482 --> 00:12:13.651
She's going to run out right away!

180
00:12:13.859 --> 00:12:15.111
Regardless of our skill.

181
00:12:15.319 --> 00:12:18.197
once we lose our mobility
we're completely helpless!

182
00:12:25.538 --> 00:12:28.124
She's not her usual.
composed self at all!

183
00:12:28.332 --> 00:12:30.960
She's trying to distract
herself from her anguish!

184
00:12:31.168 --> 00:12:33.754
It's only a matter of time until she...!

185
00:12:38.467 --> 00:12:39.885
Mikasa!

186
00:12:40.094 --> 00:12:40.970
Damn!

187
00:12:41.178 --> 00:12:42.179
Jean!

188
00:12:42.388 --> 00:12:43.889
You take the lead!

189
00:12:44.098 --> 00:12:45.516
I'll help Armin!

190
00:12:45.724 --> 00:12:47.226
- No. I will too!
- Don't be stupid!

191
00:12:47.435 --> 00:12:48.978
There are still Titans everywhere!

192
00:12:49.186 --> 00:12:51.522
Your skills are needed!

193
00:13:04.994 --> 00:13:06.203
Again...

194
00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:08.747
It's this again...

195
00:13:10.374 --> 00:13:12.793
I've lost my family again...

196
00:13:18.591 --> 00:13:23.012
Do I have to revisit this pain...

197
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:27.266
...and start all over from here again?

198
00:13:47.703 --> 00:13:51.707
It's no use. We can't
even get near Headquarters.

199
00:13:51.916 --> 00:13:54.919
Unless we're prepared to die...

200
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.510
Crap! He's out of gas!

201
00:14:04.136 --> 00:14:05.554
Stay back!

202
00:14:06.222 --> 00:14:08.265
- Tom! I'll save you!
- No!

203
00:14:08.474 --> 00:14:09.892
It's too late!

204
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.978
Stop!

205
00:14:23.489 --> 00:14:25.449
Why couldn't I stop them...?

206
00:14:29.578 --> 00:14:31.830
Why didn't I stop them?

207
00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:35.709
If I'd made them stop.
this wouldn't have happened...

208
00:14:41.173 --> 00:14:43.259
Am I really cut out for this?

209
00:14:44.343 --> 00:14:47.638
Am I really fit to have
a position of responsibility?!

210
00:14:53.435 --> 00:14:55.062
No!

211
00:15:08.492 --> 00:15:11.412
This world is cruel.

212
00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.913
And...

213
00:15:13.831 --> 00:15:15.332
...very beautiful.

214
00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:24.800
It's been a nice life.

215
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.118
Huh?

216
00:15:54.872 --> 00:15:56.290
Why?

217
00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:01.337
I was sure I'd given up...

218
00:16:07.885 --> 00:16:11.805
Why... am I standing up?

219
00:16:12.556 --> 00:16:14.767
Why... am I struggling?

220
00:16:23.442 --> 00:16:25.069
What for?

221
00:16:26.737 --> 00:16:28.155
After all...

222
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.826
There's no point
in living anymore...

223
00:16:33.035 --> 00:16:34.828
So what's driving me?

224
00:16:40.167 --> 00:16:41.585
Fight!

225
00:16:41.794 --> 00:16:44.296
Fight! Fight!

226
00:16:45.339 --> 00:16:46.757
Eren...

227
00:16:47.508 --> 00:16:48.926
Fight!

228
00:16:49.593 --> 00:16:51.387
You have to fight!

229
00:16:51.595 --> 00:16:52.596
Fight!

230
00:16:53.055 --> 00:16:54.682
Fight!

231
00:16:57.393 --> 00:16:59.853
I'm sorry. Eren...

232
00:17:00.062 --> 00:17:02.314
I won't give up anymore...

233
00:17:04.942 --> 00:17:07.611
I'll never give up again...

234
00:17:08.612 --> 00:17:11.031
If I die...

235
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.993
...I'll lose my memories of
you too. on top of everything else.

236
00:17:15.202 --> 00:17:16.412
So...

237
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.414
...I'll do whatever it takes to win!

238
00:17:18.622 --> 00:17:20.666
Whatever it takes to live!

239
00:17:37.808 --> 00:17:39.643
What just happened?!

240
00:18:00.414 --> 00:18:01.832
A Titan...

241
00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.543
...is killing...

242
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.255
...another Titan...

243
00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:33.530
Please. Mikasa!

244
00:18:33.739 --> 00:18:35.157
Be all right!

245
00:18:39.286 --> 00:18:40.704
Mikasa!

246
00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:53.717
Mikasa! Are you all right?!

247
00:18:53.926 --> 00:18:55.969
- You two okay?!
- Yeah!

248
00:18:56.178 --> 00:18:58.222
We gotta get out of here!

249
00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:03.644
Crap! Two 15-meter ones!

250
00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:06.814
No. that Titan is...

251
00:19:09.566 --> 00:19:11.193
Huh?!

252
00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:56.363
I-It finished it off?!

253
00:19:56.572 --> 00:19:58.866
It was actually aware of
its weak spot?!

254
00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:00.409
We gotta get out of here!

255
00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:01.869
Before it comes this way!

256
00:20:02.077 --> 00:20:04.997
No. it's not reacting to us.

257
00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:07.833
Any other one
would attack us for sure...

258
00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:11.879
It seemed to grasp the concept
of hand-to-hand combat too.

259
00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:13.589
Just what is it...?

260
00:20:13.797 --> 00:20:16.091
All we can do is chalk it
up as an Abnormal!

261
00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.802
We barely know
anything about 'em. after all.

262
00:20:19.011 --> 00:20:20.721
Now let's just hurry to HQ!

263
00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:24.224
Wait! Mikasa's completely out of gas!

264
00:20:24.433 --> 00:20:25.142
Huh?!

265
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.268
Whoa. are you serious?!

266
00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:29.229
Now what are we gonna do?!
We need you!

267
00:20:29.438 --> 00:20:31.106
The answer's obvious!

268
00:20:31.315 --> 00:20:33.692
I don't have much left...

269
00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:35.694
...but hurry and
switch yours with mine!

270
00:20:35.903 --> 00:20:36.862
Armin!

271
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.906
This is our only option!

272
00:20:39.323 --> 00:20:41.867
It'll amount to nothing if I keep it.

273
00:20:42.075 --> 00:20:43.493
Just...

274
00:20:43.994 --> 00:20:46.580
Use it carefully this time.

275
00:20:46.788 --> 00:20:49.124
Everyone's lives are riding on it.

276
00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:56.632
I took charge without any sense
of responsibility for their lives...

277
00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.595
For a short time. I had
even thrown away my own life...

278
00:21:01.803 --> 00:21:04.973
All for my own personal reasons.

279
00:21:06.183 --> 00:21:08.352
I'm...

280
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.020
There!

281
00:21:10.228 --> 00:21:14.024
Your mobility gear still works.
and I've given you all my blades.

282
00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:18.695
All I ask is that you
leave me with this one...

283
00:21:18.904 --> 00:21:23.784
I'd rather not get
eaten alive. if I can help it.

284
00:21:29.164 --> 00:21:30.874
N-No way...

285
00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:33.585
Armin.

286
00:21:36.004 --> 00:21:38.632
I'm not leaving you here.

287
00:21:48.392 --> 00:21:50.018
Back there...

288
00:21:51.812 --> 00:21:54.731
...I was completely confused.

289
00:21:54.940 --> 00:22:00.320
I'd never heard of a
Titan killing another Titan before.

290
00:22:01.655 --> 00:22:05.200
But I also felt a
faint glimmer of elation.

291
00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.495
Because what I saw...

292
00:22:11.248 --> 00:22:14.751
...looked like the manifestation
of humankind's anger.

293
00:22:37.482 --> 00:22:42.404
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

294
00:22:42.612 --> 00:22:48.660
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

295
00:22:48.869 --> 00:22:53.331
<i>Over and over you cast them aside.
only to find more</i>

296
00:22:53.540 --> 00:23:00.005
<i>Now. rest in peace</i>

297
00:23:00.213 --> 00:23:11.349
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

298
00:23:11.558 --> 00:23:21.610
<i>and the more we forget
the more we remember again</i>

299
00:23:21.818 --> 00:23:27.574
<i>In this beautiful. cruel world</i>

300
00:23:27.783 --> 00:23:32.746
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

301
00:23:32.954 --> 00:23:38.460
<i>Oh. with our strength... and our weakness...</i>

302
00:23:38.668 --> 00:23:44.132
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

303
00:23:44.341 --> 00:23:47.761
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

304
00:23:54.684 --> 00:23:57.104
A Titan that kills other Titans.

305
00:23:57.312 --> 00:24:03.318
The sight of it leaves the 104th Cadet
Corps Class awestruck and breathless.

306
00:24:03.527 --> 00:24:07.781
What ultimately appears
before them. though. is...

9999
00:00:0.500 --> 00:00:2.00
