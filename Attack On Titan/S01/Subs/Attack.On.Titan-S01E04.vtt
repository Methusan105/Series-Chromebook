00:00:01.836 --> 00:00:09.135
In the year 845. the Colossal Titan
and the Armored Titan suddenly appeared

2
00:00:09.344 --> 00:00:13.556
and destroyed one of humanity's walls...
and everyday life with it.

3
00:00:13.765 --> 00:00:18.353
And then. finally freed
from their century-long hunger.

4
00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:20.689
the Titans overran humankind once again.

5
00:00:20.897 --> 00:00:24.734
Stop!

6
00:00:24.943 --> 00:00:28.071
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria.

7
00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.783
lost 20% of its population
and one-third of its territory.

8
00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:36.204
and was forced to retreat behind Wall Rose.

9
00:00:54.264 --> 00:00:59.102
<i>Unknown are the names
of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

10
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.566
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth
and long for the wind</i>

11
00:01:04.774 --> 00:01:09.654
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

12
00:01:09.863 --> 00:01:14.993
<i>Only the will to fight
can change the here and now!</i>

13
00:01:15.201 --> 00:01:20.290
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve
to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

14
00:01:20.498 --> 00:01:22.834
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

15
00:01:23.042 --> 00:01:25.712
<i>Give us the freedom of dying.
starving wolves!</i>

16
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.092
<i>The humiliation of being caged
is what triggers us to fight back</i>

17
00:01:31.301 --> 00:01:36.389
<i>We hunters slaughter prey
beyond the castle walls.</i>

18
00:01:36.598 --> 00:01:41.603
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust.</i>

19
00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:48.735
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows
pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

20
00:02:22.435 --> 00:02:25.522
Pick up the pace! Run. you lead-footed laggards!

21
00:02:27.065 --> 00:02:28.983
What's your problem. Arlelt?!

22
00:02:29.192 --> 00:02:30.735
You're dragging your feet!

23
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.824
Too heavy for you?!
Maybe you'd prefer I let you drop your gear?!

24
00:02:37.116 --> 00:02:41.079
If this were a real mission.
you'd be Titan food by now!

25
00:02:42.872 --> 00:02:44.582
Damn...

26
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:46.251
Give it here!

27
00:02:47.126 --> 00:02:51.923
You're gonna fail out at this rate!
We're being graded today!

28
00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:55.009
But you'll get points marked off too if you do that...

29
00:02:55.218 --> 00:02:59.514
Then make the grade without
getting found out! Before I change my mind!

30
00:03:02.308 --> 00:03:04.394
Reiner Braun...

31
00:03:05.812 --> 00:03:08.857
Stalwart in both mind and body.

32
00:03:09.065 --> 00:03:11.860
and well-respected by his comrades.

33
00:03:13.945 --> 00:03:17.323
I refuse to be a burden! Even if it costs me my life!

34
00:03:21.953 --> 00:03:23.746
Armin Arlelt.

35
00:03:23.955 --> 00:03:25.373
Although lacking in physical strength.

36
00:03:25.582 --> 00:03:28.418
his aptitude in the classroom is extraordinary.

37
00:03:45.685 --> 00:03:47.353
Annie Leonhart.

38
00:03:47.562 --> 00:03:49.439
Her slice attacks are absolutely flawless.

39
00:03:49.647 --> 00:03:52.525
but her reclusive tendencies make her
a poor fit for coordinated efforts.

40
00:03:52.734 --> 00:03:54.193
Bertholdt Hoover.

41
00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:58.656
He possesses remarkable potential.
but lacks aggressiveness.

42
00:03:58.865 --> 00:04:00.366
Jean Kirschtein.

43
00:04:00.575 --> 00:04:02.410
Top-class omni-directional mobility.

44
00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:06.414
But his volatile personality
tends to cause friction with others.

45
00:04:08.541 --> 00:04:10.793
I can't slice as good as those two!

46
00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:13.504
I'll just have to find the Titans before them!

47
00:04:16.007 --> 00:04:18.009
If anyone gets into the Military Police...

48
00:04:18.217 --> 00:04:19.636
...it'll be me!

49
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.474
Thanks for the help. Jean!

50
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.061
Following you was a good idea!

51
00:04:31.064 --> 00:04:33.399
Hooray!

52
00:04:34.567 --> 00:04:36.027
Sasha Braus.

53
00:04:36.235 --> 00:04:38.196
She has unconventionally good intuition.

54
00:04:38.404 --> 00:04:41.491
but also demonstrates poor teamwork as a result.

55
00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:43.368
Conny Springer.

56
00:04:43.576 --> 00:04:48.539
He excels at executing quick turns.
but is also a bit dim-witted.

57
00:04:48.748 --> 00:04:50.333
Here they come.

58
00:04:58.257 --> 00:05:00.969
Damn! Shallower than Mikasa again!

59
00:05:01.177 --> 00:05:02.971
Mikasa Ackermann.

60
00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:05.431
Completely proficient in every area.

61
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.519
It's apt to say she's an unmatched.
unprecedented genius.

62
00:05:09.727 --> 00:05:11.145
Eren Jaeger.

63
00:05:11.354 --> 00:05:13.439
He has no real specialties.
but he's improved his grades

64
00:05:13.648 --> 00:05:15.984
with his unparalleled effort.

65
00:05:16.192 --> 00:05:20.822
And he possesses twice
the sense of purpose than anyone else.

66
00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:38.881
Oww!

67
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.385
Sorry. I'm not good at holding back.

68
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.931
Now it's your turn to be the rogue.

69
00:05:47.932 --> 00:05:49.559
What's the matter?

70
00:05:49.767 --> 00:05:52.812
I don't get this training.

71
00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:55.815
Why would soldiers fight other people?

72
00:05:56.024 --> 00:05:59.902
Only an idiot would take on a target barehanded.

73
00:06:02.113 --> 00:06:04.949
That's irresponsible thinking.

74
00:06:05.158 --> 00:06:06.909
We're soldiers.

75
00:06:07.118 --> 00:06:11.247
There are times we can't run away.
no matter how bad the situation is.

76
00:06:11.456 --> 00:06:13.916
No matter what the enemy is.
we have to be ready for it.

77
00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:17.545
whether it means
using cannons or combat techniques.

78
00:06:17.754 --> 00:06:22.258
I believe that's the responsibility of a strong soldier.

79
00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:25.720
Anyway. look there.

80
00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:29.932
Oh. that's Annie.

81
00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:33.186
She's slacking off without
the commandant noticing again.

82
00:06:33.394 --> 00:06:37.065
All right. Eren. That slouch needs a talking-to.

83
00:06:37.273 --> 00:06:41.486
Let's teach her how a soldier's supposed to act.

84
00:06:41.694 --> 00:06:43.154
Huh?

85
00:06:46.532 --> 00:06:48.743
Not fond of the commandant's head-butts?

86
00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:51.370
If you don't wanna end up any shorter.

87
00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:54.499
think back to when you first came here
and start taking things seriously.

88
00:06:54.707 --> 00:06:57.043
Hey. why are you being so rude?

89
00:07:00.046 --> 00:07:01.756
Man. she's mad.

90
00:07:01.964 --> 00:07:04.425
I thought she looked scary enough as it is.

91
00:07:04.634 --> 00:07:07.053
but that's nothing compared to when she's pissed.

92
00:07:07.261 --> 00:07:08.971
All right! Get started. Eren!

93
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.598
Me?!

94
00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:19.065
You know the drill. right. Annie?

95
00:07:19.273 --> 00:07:20.525
Here I come!

96
00:07:24.862 --> 00:07:26.697
Wh-What the...?!

97
00:07:26.906 --> 00:07:28.866
She kicked my leg?!

98
00:07:29.742 --> 00:07:31.202
Can I go now?

99
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.039
No! The drill's not over until you take the dagger!

100
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.375
Wait. Annie!

101
00:07:37.583 --> 00:07:39.877
You're supposed to do this a certain way!

102
00:07:47.593 --> 00:07:49.679
There.

103
00:07:49.887 --> 00:07:52.932
Now it's your turn to attack me.

104
00:07:53.141 --> 00:07:54.809
N-No... I'm not...

105
00:07:55.017 --> 00:07:57.061
Do it. Reiner.

106
00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:01.315
I thought you wanted to teach her
about a soldier's responsibility?

107
00:08:04.485 --> 00:08:09.282
Yeah. Sometimes a soldier <i>can't</i> back down.

108
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.534
This is one of those times!

109
00:08:16.289 --> 00:08:18.124
That's an amazing technique.

110
00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:20.585
Who did you learn it from?

111
00:08:20.793 --> 00:08:21.878
My father.

112
00:08:22.086 --> 00:08:25.715
- Your <i>dad</i> came up with that move?
- What does it matter?

113
00:08:25.923 --> 00:08:28.968
There's no point to any of this.

114
00:08:29.177 --> 00:08:31.470
You mean this training?

115
00:08:31.679 --> 00:08:34.932
We aren't graded on our hand-to-hand combat skills.

116
00:08:35.141 --> 00:08:37.977
Most people brush it off. like them.

117
00:08:38.186 --> 00:08:41.856
Because only the top ten cadets
are allowed to join the Military Police

118
00:08:42.064 --> 00:08:44.817
and serve in the interior.

119
00:08:45.026 --> 00:08:49.447
The only ones who take it seriously
are naive idiots like you...

120
00:08:49.655 --> 00:08:51.908
...or just ordinary idiots.

121
00:08:52.116 --> 00:08:53.951
Crap! The commandant!

122
00:08:56.412 --> 00:09:00.791
For some reason. in this world.
the better you are at fighting Titans

123
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.377
the further you can get from them.

124
00:09:03.586 --> 00:09:05.963
How do you think this farce came about?

125
00:09:06.172 --> 00:09:09.008
I don't know... That's a good question!

126
00:09:13.304 --> 00:09:17.516
Maybe because it's human nature?

127
00:09:23.773 --> 00:09:26.692
Anyway. I refuse to be stupid enough

128
00:09:26.901 --> 00:09:31.447
to play "Soldier" in this inane world.

129
00:09:34.367 --> 00:09:37.703
Looks like you're not much of a warrior at all.

130
00:09:39.497 --> 00:09:42.708
I was so caught up in getting stronger
that I never realized it.

131
00:09:42.917 --> 00:09:45.544
It's such a clear contradiction...

132
00:09:45.753 --> 00:09:48.589
They're honing their Titan-killing skills

133
00:09:48.798 --> 00:09:51.759
just to get <i>away</i> from the Titans!

134
00:09:56.305 --> 00:09:58.015
It can't be helped.

135
00:09:58.224 --> 00:10:02.103
Before Wall Maria fell. only the Scouts
needed omni-directional mobility.

136
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:04.689
and they're a small regiment.

137
00:10:04.897 --> 00:10:07.483
- That put ODM expertise at risk...
- Give it a strong blast for just a second.

138
00:10:07.692 --> 00:10:12.154
- ...so this was a way to prevent its decline.
- Relying on inertia will save you gas.

139
00:10:12.363 --> 00:10:13.990
Easier said than done.

140
00:10:14.198 --> 00:10:17.952
Yeah. maybe not everyone can pull it off...

141
00:10:19.412 --> 00:10:21.247
...but there's no harm in knowing about it.

142
00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:23.582
if you wanna join the Military Police.

143
00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:26.419
Yeah! I'd love to get in!

144
00:10:26.627 --> 00:10:30.548
Working near the king...
There's no greater honor than that!

145
00:10:30.756 --> 00:10:32.091
Hold on. Marco!

146
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:36.345
Quit talkin' like a goody-two-shoes
and say what you <i>really</i> think!

147
00:10:36.554 --> 00:10:38.097
You wanna join the Military Police

148
00:10:38.306 --> 00:10:41.642
'cause it means a safe. comfy life in the interior!

149
00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:43.853
No! I really do want to...

150
00:10:44.061 --> 00:10:46.022
It's comfy in the interior?

151
00:10:47.273 --> 00:10:51.027
Until five years ago. <i>this</i> used to be the interior too.

152
00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:54.196
What's your point. Eren?

153
00:10:55.364 --> 00:10:58.492
Jean. You don't need to go to the interior.

154
00:10:58.701 --> 00:11:01.662
I'd say your head is nice
and spacious enough as it is.

155
00:11:04.457 --> 00:11:05.416
You little...

156
00:11:05.624 --> 00:11:09.545
Honing your Titan-killing skills
to get <i>away</i> from the Titans...

157
00:11:09.754 --> 00:11:12.590
Doesn't that seem like a weird system to you?

158
00:11:12.798 --> 00:11:14.425
You only say that now?

159
00:11:14.633 --> 00:11:18.262
I <i>want</i> that stupid system
to stay in place. for my sake.

160
00:11:18.471 --> 00:11:19.555
You piece of scum!

161
00:11:19.764 --> 00:11:21.432
Shut up! This is the real world!

162
00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.975
Eren! Quit it!

163
00:11:23.184 --> 00:11:24.894
Stop that.

164
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.858
- Screw you!
- Huh?!

165
00:11:31.067 --> 00:11:32.526
Let go! You're gonna rip it!

166
00:11:32.735 --> 00:11:34.612
I don't give a damn about your clothes! I'm jealous!

167
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.031
Huh?! What are you talking about?!

168
00:11:44.497 --> 00:11:45.623
I see now...

169
00:11:45.831 --> 00:11:50.461
He always has to take his feelings out on others...

170
00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:53.089
Just like I always do.

171
00:11:53.297 --> 00:11:55.257
But not this time!

172
00:11:57.343 --> 00:12:00.471
I'm going to use that move
to take control of the situation!

173
00:12:10.981 --> 00:12:12.775
What the hell was that?!

174
00:12:12.983 --> 00:12:15.111
A combat technique I learned the hard way

175
00:12:15.319 --> 00:12:17.988
while you were screwing around.

176
00:12:19.615 --> 00:12:23.494
A carefree. capricious life
is your idea of the real world?

177
00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:27.623
And you honestly call yourself a soldier?!

178
00:12:36.132 --> 00:12:39.385
I heard a loud sound just now...

179
00:12:39.593 --> 00:12:42.638
Would anyone care to explain?

180
00:12:47.101 --> 00:12:50.479
- It was Sasha. She passed gas.
- Huh?!

181
00:12:50.688 --> 00:12:52.857
<i>You</i> again?

182
00:12:54.191 --> 00:12:56.861
Learn some decency. will you?!

183
00:13:05.828 --> 00:13:11.333
218 cadets went on to reach graduation.

184
00:13:13.669 --> 00:13:15.212
Give your hearts!

185
00:13:15.421 --> 00:13:17.006
Yes. Sir!

186
00:13:17.214 --> 00:13:23.053
You have three options
after you graduate from the Cadets today!

187
00:13:23.262 --> 00:13:27.224
The Garrison Regiment.
which reinforces the walls and protects each city!

188
00:13:27.433 --> 00:13:29.268
The Scout Regiment. which risks life and limb

189
00:13:29.477 --> 00:13:31.687
to venture into Titan territory outside the walls!

190
00:13:31.896 --> 00:13:34.732
And the Military Police Regiment.
which serves under the king

191
00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.942
by policing the people and preserving order!

192
00:13:37.151 --> 00:13:40.070
Of course. the only ones
allowed to join the Military Police

193
00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:43.407
are the top ten cadets who were previously named!

194
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:53.000
We've finally made it here...

195
00:13:53.209 --> 00:13:55.336
Now it's our turn

196
00:13:55.544 --> 00:13:57.838
to devour the Titans!

197
00:14:14.438 --> 00:14:15.147
Yes!

198
00:14:15.356 --> 00:14:16.815
Now I'm gonna be in the Military Police!

199
00:14:17.024 --> 00:14:19.860
No more worrying about food!

200
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:22.947
How'd I get ranked under Eren?!

201
00:14:23.155 --> 00:14:24.865
Damn!

202
00:14:25.074 --> 00:14:27.868
Are you seriously not gonna join
the Military Police Regiment. Eren?!

203
00:14:28.077 --> 00:14:30.788
Even after you got into the top ten and all?!

204
00:14:30.996 --> 00:14:33.499
My mind was set from the very start.

205
00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:37.419
I didn't train all this time to live in the interior.

206
00:14:37.628 --> 00:14:39.588
I did it to fight the Titans.

207
00:14:39.797 --> 00:14:41.465
We can't beat them!

208
00:14:45.386 --> 00:14:49.515
You know how many tens of thousands
of people have been eaten so far...

209
00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:54.103
The answer was clear
after we lost 20% of our population.

210
00:14:54.311 --> 00:14:58.524
Humanity <i>can't</i> beat the Titans.

211
00:15:03.988 --> 00:15:05.489
So?

212
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:10.202
You're gonna give up
because you think we can't win?!

213
00:15:10.411 --> 00:15:14.456
- Well...
- Yes. humanity <i>has</i> lost so far.

214
00:15:14.665 --> 00:15:17.918
That's because we were clueless about the Titans!

215
00:15:18.127 --> 00:15:21.005
Material warfare is useless against them.

216
00:15:21.213 --> 00:15:26.468
We lost. but the information we gained
in battle will lead to further hope!

217
00:15:26.677 --> 00:15:29.471
Are we just going to throw away
all the advances in fighting techniques

218
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.475
that cost us tens of thousands of lives
so we can be Titan fodder?!

219
00:15:33.684 --> 00:15:35.477
The hell with that!

220
00:15:35.686 --> 00:15:39.189
I'm going to drive out every last Titan

221
00:15:39.398 --> 00:15:41.567
and leave these cramped walls!

222
00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:43.777
That's my dream!

223
00:15:43.986 --> 00:15:47.865
Humanity hasn't <i>truly</i> been defeated yet!

224
00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:57.583
Wait. Eren!

225
00:15:57.791 --> 00:16:01.253
If you wanna go outside the walls. be my guest!

226
00:16:01.462 --> 00:16:04.465
<i>I'm</i> gonna join the Military Police!

227
00:16:14.266 --> 00:16:17.311
Eren. That stuff about your dream just now...

228
00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:19.980
Yeah. I borrowed those ideas of yours

229
00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:22.816
about going outside instead of staying inside.

230
00:16:24.902 --> 00:16:27.196
I'm going to join the Scout Regiment!

231
00:16:28.072 --> 00:16:29.531
Are you serious. Armin?!

232
00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.868
You were the top in classroom studies!
You should put that to use!

233
00:16:33.077 --> 00:16:36.622
I <i>won't</i> be a burden. Even if it costs me my life.

234
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.041
I'll join the Scouts too.

235
00:16:39.249 --> 00:16:43.003
Hey! You graduated top of the class!
You should join the Military Police!

236
00:16:43.212 --> 00:16:48.092
If you join the Military Police. then I will too.

237
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:52.888
If you join the Garrison Regiment. then I will too.

238
00:16:53.097 --> 00:16:57.559
Because you'll die an early death unless I'm around.

239
00:16:57.768 --> 00:17:00.813
I never asked for your help.

240
00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:04.108
I don't want to lose any more of my family.

241
00:17:26.505 --> 00:17:29.633
It's here! The main unit of the Scout Regiment!

242
00:17:29.842 --> 00:17:33.512
Commander Erwin! Give those Titans a real thrashing!

243
00:17:34.513 --> 00:17:37.599
Look! It's Captain Levi!

244
00:17:37.808 --> 00:17:40.686
They say he's as mighty as an entire brigade!

245
00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:43.147
Ugh. Talk about annoying...

246
00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:45.399
This is nothing like five years ago!

247
00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:48.861
People actually feel hopeful about the Scout members!

248
00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:51.822
Yeah. everyone's cheered up since then.

249
00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.074
Nothing's happened in five years.

250
00:17:54.283 --> 00:17:56.452
They've upgraded the mounted cannons too.

251
00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.037
I doubt the Colossal Titan will show up anymore.

252
00:17:59.246 --> 00:18:00.372
Yeah!

253
00:18:00.581 --> 00:18:03.000
That's a load of crap. you idiotic couple!

254
00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:05.669
Wh-What? <i>Us</i>. a married couple?

255
00:18:05.878 --> 00:18:07.796
You're getting ahead of yourself. Eren!

256
00:18:08.839 --> 00:18:11.049
Hey. guys!

257
00:18:11.258 --> 00:18:12.801
Mr. Hannes!

258
00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:16.472
Heard you graduated yesterday.

259
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.974
Man. you brats have really matured.

260
00:18:19.183 --> 00:18:20.517
You too. Mr. Hannes!

261
00:18:20.726 --> 00:18:23.228
You used to be a drunk. but now
you're chief of the Corps of Engineers.

262
00:18:23.437 --> 00:18:25.063
Oh. you!

263
00:18:26.857 --> 00:18:31.570
I'm sorry I couldn't save your mom.

264
00:18:32.905 --> 00:18:35.866
It wasn't your fault.

265
00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:38.494
We're not ignorant anymore.

266
00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:41.371
We won't let another tragedy like that happen.

267
00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:44.541
We <i>will</i> defeat the Titans!

268
00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:53.050
I don't know if I should be happy
that you've grown up or not...

269
00:18:53.258 --> 00:18:55.177
Don't go dyin'. now.

270
00:18:56.887 --> 00:18:57.971
Huh?!

271
00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.057
You're joining the Scouts?!

272
00:19:00.265 --> 00:19:02.726
Conny! You were so set on the Military Police!

273
00:19:02.935 --> 00:19:05.854
Yeah. I was! But...

274
00:19:06.063 --> 00:19:08.690
Sounds like your speech yesterday won him over!

275
00:19:08.899 --> 00:19:09.900
Huh?!

276
00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:11.318
M-Mind your own business!

277
00:19:11.527 --> 00:19:14.238
I decided it on my own!

278
00:19:14.446 --> 00:19:16.824
Don't be so embarrassed.

279
00:19:17.032 --> 00:19:18.659
You're not the only one.

280
00:19:20.494 --> 00:19:21.495
Thomas...

281
00:19:21.703 --> 00:19:22.788
You don't mean...?

282
00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:25.582
Umm. everyone?

283
00:19:25.791 --> 00:19:29.503
I brought some meat from the officers' storehouse!

284
00:19:30.546 --> 00:19:33.006
Sasha! Do you want to end up
in solitary confinement?!

285
00:19:33.215 --> 00:19:34.550
You really are crazy!

286
00:19:34.758 --> 00:19:36.385
So much it's scary...

287
00:19:36.593 --> 00:19:38.971
We can all share it later...

288
00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:41.598
All sliced up. and between some bread...

289
00:19:42.558 --> 00:19:44.601
- Go put it back!
- Yeah!

290
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:48.272
After we lost all that land.
meat's become really valuable.

291
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.274
It'll be fine!

292
00:19:53.944 --> 00:19:58.490
We can just raise more cattle and sheep
once we retake our land!

293
00:20:03.078 --> 00:20:04.621
I'll have some of the meat too!

294
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:08.292
M-Me too! Save me some!

295
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.586
I'll have some too. of course!

296
00:20:10.794 --> 00:20:12.546
Guys...

297
00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:14.673
Why are you just standing there. Eren?

298
00:20:14.882 --> 00:20:17.593
We'll get found out if we don't get back to work!

299
00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:19.636
Lunch isn't for a while!

300
00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:29.104
Five years have passed since then...

301
00:20:29.313 --> 00:20:34.401
Humanity is finally regaining its dignity.

302
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.361
We can win!

303
00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:41.408
Humanity's fight back...

304
00:20:41.617 --> 00:20:43.285
...is just beginning!

305
00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:04.598
Oww! Hot!

306
00:21:04.806 --> 00:21:06.934
Wh-What the...?!

307
00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:15.484
Samuel!

308
00:21:15.692 --> 00:21:17.235
Sasha!

309
00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.036
Samuel!

310
00:21:26.244 --> 00:21:28.747
Stay still!

311
00:21:28.956 --> 00:21:30.624
That was close!

312
00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:34.544
The wall...

313
00:21:34.753 --> 00:21:36.380
It's broken!

314
00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:39.675
It's happening again!

315
00:21:39.883 --> 00:21:42.260
The Titans are going to get in!

316
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:47.182
I'm going to drive out...

317
00:21:47.391 --> 00:21:50.686
...every last one!

318
00:21:50.894 --> 00:21:54.564
Every... last one...

319
00:21:56.692 --> 00:21:58.443
Mounted Cannon Maintenance Squad 4!

320
00:21:58.652 --> 00:22:00.529
Prepare for battle!

321
00:22:01.405 --> 00:22:04.199
The target is the Colossal Titan dead ahead!

322
00:22:04.408 --> 00:22:07.744
This is our chance! Don't let it get away!

323
00:22:17.045 --> 00:22:18.714
Hey. there.

324

It's been five years since we met.

00:22:40.444 --> 00:22:45.365

326
00:22:45.574 --> 00:22:51.621
