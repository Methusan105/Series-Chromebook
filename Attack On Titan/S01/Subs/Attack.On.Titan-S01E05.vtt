00:00:02.504 --> 00:00:09.969
In the year 845. the Colossal Titan
and the Armored Titan suddenly appeared

2
00:00:10.178 --> 00:00:14.641
and destroyed one of humanity's
walls... and everyday life with it.

3
00:00:15.475 --> 00:00:18.645
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria.

4
00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:22.273
lost 20% of its population
and one-third of its territory.

5
00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:26.820
and was forced to
retreat behind Wall Rose.

6
00:00:27.987 --> 00:00:31.616
And then. in the year 850...

7
00:00:31.825 --> 00:00:34.077
Humanity's fight back...

8
00:00:34.285 --> 00:00:35.870
...is just beginning!

9
00:00:38.206 --> 00:00:41.376
The target is the
Colossal Titan dead ahead!

10
00:00:41.876 --> 00:00:45.004
This is our chance!
Don't let it get away!

11
00:00:47.716 --> 00:00:49.134
Hey. there.

12
00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:52.137
It's been five years since we met.

13
00:01:08.403 --> 00:01:13.241
<i>Unknown are the names
of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

14
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.705
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth
and long for the wind</i>

15
00:01:18.913 --> 00:01:23.793
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

16
00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:29.132
<i>Only the will to fight
can change the here and now!</i>

17
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.429
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve
to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

18
00:01:34.637 --> 00:01:36.973
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

19
00:01:37.182 --> 00:01:39.851
<i>Give us the freedom of dying.
starving wolves!</i>

20
00:01:40.059 --> 00:01:45.231
<i>The humiliation of being caged
is what triggers us to fight back</i>

21
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.528
<i>We hunters slaughter prey
beyond the castle walls.</i>

22
00:01:50.737 --> 00:01:55.742
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust.</i>

23
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.874
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows
pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

24
00:02:51.047 --> 00:02:54.717
He went for the cannons!

25
00:02:55.718 --> 00:02:59.222
And he didn't take out
the gate by accident. either!

26
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.185
He does have intelligence...!

27
00:03:09.148 --> 00:03:11.651
Still. this is the perfect chance!

28
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.487
He's the only one
who can destroy the wall!

29
00:03:16.406 --> 00:03:18.408
If I can just take him out...!

30
00:03:25.748 --> 00:03:27.208
Too slow!

31
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.129
Got you!

32
00:03:33.006 --> 00:03:34.424
Wha...?!

33
00:03:34.632 --> 00:03:36.092
Hot!

34
00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:47.687
Go!

35
00:03:51.024 --> 00:03:52.525
I missed?!

36
00:03:58.114 --> 00:03:59.574
No...

37
00:03:59.782 --> 00:04:04.162
The Colossal Titan disappeared!

38
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.998
Eren! Did you beat it?!

39
00:04:07.206 --> 00:04:09.125
No!

40
00:04:09.334 --> 00:04:11.127
It's just like five years ago!

41
00:04:11.336 --> 00:04:14.964
He suddenly appeared.
then suddenly disappeared!

42
00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.510
I'm sorry. I let him get away.

43
00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:22.472
What are you apologizing for?
<i>We</i> were scared stiff...

44
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.141
Hey! This is no time for that!

45
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.018
The wall's been broken!

46
00:04:27.226 --> 00:04:30.480
We have to hurry and seal
it before the Titans get in again!

47
00:04:30.688 --> 00:04:32.148
What are you doing?!

48
00:04:32.357 --> 00:04:35.985
The Colossal Titan Response
Operation is already underway!

49
00:04:36.194 --> 00:04:37.654
Return to HQ at once!

50
00:04:37.862 --> 00:04:40.448
Anyone who's come into contact
with it. remember to give a report!

51
00:04:40.657 --> 00:04:41.157
Yes. Sir!

52
00:04:41.366 --> 00:04:43.952
We pray for the
advance team's success!

53
00:05:00.093 --> 00:05:02.220
Take only the
absolute bare necessities!

54
00:05:02.428 --> 00:05:04.430
Please evacuate
in a calm manner!

55
00:05:08.393 --> 00:05:09.936
If they break through here.

56
00:05:10.144 --> 00:05:14.065
we'll have another tragedy just
like five years ago on our hands!

57
00:05:14.273 --> 00:05:18.653
We <i>must</i> hold the Titans off here!

58
00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:21.739
Prepare to intercept!

59
00:05:23.574 --> 00:05:24.993
Fire!

60
00:05:31.416 --> 00:05:33.251
Charge!

61
00:05:36.337 --> 00:05:41.134
You cadets have successfully graduated!
You are now proper soldiers!

62
00:05:41.342 --> 00:05:44.095
I have high hopes
for you in this operation!

63
00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:47.015
Don't worry. Hanna.

64
00:05:47.223 --> 00:05:49.017
I promise I'll keep you safe.

65
00:05:49.225 --> 00:05:50.643
Franz...

66
00:05:54.147 --> 00:05:56.357
Are you okay. Armin?!

67
00:05:56.566 --> 00:05:58.568
I-I'm fine!

68
00:05:58.776 --> 00:06:01.195
I'll calm down soon enough!

69
00:06:01.404 --> 00:06:03.031
Still. this is bad!

70
00:06:03.239 --> 00:06:08.119
We don't have the technology to
quickly seal an 8-meter-high hole!

71
00:06:08.327 --> 00:06:13.958
And we never did manage to unearth
that big rock near the front gate!

72
00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:19.130
Unless we seal the hole.
this city's as good as lost!

73
00:06:22.842 --> 00:06:27.055
It's only a matter of time
until Wall Rose is breached!

74
00:06:27.263 --> 00:06:30.308
In fact. if they ever feel like it.

75
00:06:30.516 --> 00:06:32.977
they can pretty much wipe
out humanity anytime they want!

76
00:06:33.186 --> 00:06:34.604
Armin!

77
00:06:35.021 --> 00:06:37.982
Calm down! This isn't like last time!

78
00:06:38.191 --> 00:06:41.527
Humanity <i>won't</i> give in
to the Titans anymore!

79
00:06:46.032 --> 00:06:47.992
I'm sorry...

80
00:06:48.201 --> 00:06:49.660
I'm all right...

81
00:07:05.218 --> 00:07:09.222
Come. now.
Are you playing seriously?

82
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.851
There. I win again.

83
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:21.442
We square off once a month. yet you
never seem to improve at all. Pyxis.

84
00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:26.739
Oh. no. I am just no
match for you. Lord Wald.

85
00:07:30.451 --> 00:07:35.456
You're the top officer in charge
of the entire southern territory.

86
00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:40.628
How do you hope
to triumph over the Titans

87
00:07:40.837 --> 00:07:42.755
with such paltry skill and intellect?

88
00:07:42.964 --> 00:07:44.507
Commander Pyxis!

89
00:07:44.715 --> 00:07:46.050
I bring a message!

90
00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:48.052
How uncouth! Who are you...?!

91
00:07:48.261 --> 00:07:51.055
The Colossal Titan has appeared in Trost!

92
00:07:51.264 --> 00:07:53.307
The gate has been destroyed!

93
00:08:05.695 --> 00:08:09.574
Mm. This is a fine drink. indeed.

94
00:08:09.782 --> 00:08:14.787
As a fellow warrior on the field
of battle. I will humbly accept it.

95
00:08:14.996 --> 00:08:18.291
H-Hey! Wait. Pyxis!

96
00:08:19.584 --> 00:08:22.461
Pyxis! Hey! Wait just a minute!

97
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.673
I forbid you to leave!

98
00:08:25.882 --> 00:08:30.678
Assemble your troops
immediately and defend my domain!

99
00:08:30.887 --> 00:08:33.931
That is your duty!

100
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.643
Lord Wald.

101
00:08:37.852 --> 00:08:42.607
As we speak. soldiers in Trost
are literally risking their lives in battle.

102
00:08:42.815 --> 00:08:45.902
Commander.
I will ready the horses.

103
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:50.072
I presume many lives are
being lost as well.

104
00:08:50.281 --> 00:08:53.159
Right now. at this very moment.

105
00:08:53.367 --> 00:08:55.828
Hmph. Insignificant lives. I'm sure.

106
00:08:56.037 --> 00:08:57.705
Forget about them.

107
00:08:57.914 --> 00:09:00.708
Your presence there
won't change anything anyway;

108
00:09:00.917 --> 00:09:04.962
you <i>continually</i> lose
to me in our tabletop skirmishes!

109
00:09:05.171 --> 00:09:07.673
Fear not. Your Lordship.

110
00:09:07.882 --> 00:09:10.218
Should he face the
Titans on a real battlefield.

111
00:09:10.426 --> 00:09:14.347
the commander will not
need to be as lenient with them.

112
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.558
Enough.

113
00:09:18.684 --> 00:09:20.186
Lord Wald.

114
00:09:20.394 --> 00:09:25.775
Please have another pleasant and
peaceful day as always.

115
00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:29.195
H-Hey!

116
00:09:30.071 --> 00:09:31.280
Pyxis!

117
00:09:31.489 --> 00:09:34.158
Come back! Pyxis!

118
00:09:34.367 --> 00:09:36.661
Pyxis!

119
00:09:49.048 --> 00:09:51.842
As practiced.
you will now split into your squads

120
00:09:52.051 --> 00:09:56.013
and perform resupply. message
relay. and Titan-clearing duties

121
00:09:56.222 --> 00:09:59.016
under the command
of the Garrison Regiment!

122
00:09:59.225 --> 00:10:02.019
The Garrison Regiment's
intercept squad will take the vanguard!

123
00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:02.645
"Vanguard"

124
00:10:02.645 --> 00:10:05.022
"Vanguard"
"Middle Guard"
The Cadets. led by the support squad.
will take the middle guard!

125
00:10:05.022 --> 00:10:05.773
"Vanguard"
"Middle Guard"

126
00:10:05.773 --> 00:10:08.943
"Vanguard"
"Middle Guard"
"Rearguard"
And the Garrison Regiment's
elite squads will take the rearguard!

127
00:10:08.943 --> 00:10:09.193
"Vanguard"
"Middle Guard"
"Rearguard"

128
00:10:09.193 --> 00:10:10.820
Additionally. I've received word

129
00:10:11.028 --> 00:10:14.282
that the advance team
has been wiped out!

130
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:18.369
The outer gate has been breached.
and the Titans have been allowed inside!

131
00:10:18.577 --> 00:10:22.915
In other words. the Armored Titan
<i>could</i> very well appear again

132
00:10:23.124 --> 00:10:26.127
and demolish the inner gate at any time!

133
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.131
- You can't be serious...
- You gotta be kidding me...

134
00:10:30.339 --> 00:10:32.633
If they end up breaching Rose too...!

135
00:10:32.842 --> 00:10:34.677
Quiet!

136
00:10:34.885 --> 00:10:37.638
The vanguard is currently
engaged with the enemy!

137
00:10:37.847 --> 00:10:39.974
This defense operation
has but one objective:

138
00:10:40.182 --> 00:10:45.229
to defend Wall Rose until the
citizens have finished evacuating!

139
00:10:45.438 --> 00:10:50.401
Also. as I'm sure you're well aware.
desertion is punishable by death!

140
00:10:50.609 --> 00:10:52.820
Be prepared to lay down your lives!

141
00:10:53.029 --> 00:10:54.155
Dismissed!

142
00:10:54.363 --> 00:10:55.781
Sir!

143
00:11:01.037 --> 00:11:03.122
Why today?

144
00:11:03.331 --> 00:11:06.292
I would've been on my
way to the interior tomorrow...

145
00:11:08.169 --> 00:11:09.795
Are you okay?!

146
00:11:15.176 --> 00:11:19.055
No. no. no. noooo...

147
00:11:25.394 --> 00:11:26.979
Move!

148
00:11:27.188 --> 00:11:28.981
Hey. Jean! What's wrong?!

149
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:30.733
"What's wrong?!"

150
00:11:30.941 --> 00:11:34.111
That's easy for you to say.
you suicidal maniac!

151
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.822
You <i>want</i> to join the Scouts!

152
00:11:37.031 --> 00:11:40.618
You're ready to
be Titan chow anytime!

153
00:11:40.826 --> 00:11:43.621
- But I was headed for the interior tomorrow!
- Calm down!

154
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:45.623
You expect me to calm
down and accept death?!

155
00:11:45.831 --> 00:11:46.874
No!

156
00:11:47.083 --> 00:11:48.501
Think back!

157
00:11:49.043 --> 00:11:51.879
Think back to the three years
of sweat and blood we endured!

158
00:11:53.005 --> 00:11:56.509
So many times we came close
to dying during those three years!

159
00:11:56.717 --> 00:11:58.677
Some people did die.

160
00:11:58.886 --> 00:12:02.014
Some ran off. Others were kicked out.

161
00:12:02.223 --> 00:12:04.141
But we survived!

162
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:05.559
Right?!

163
00:12:05.768 --> 00:12:09.021
I'm sure we can survive today. too!

164
00:12:10.147 --> 00:12:15.111
You can just survive today
and leave for the interior tomorrow!

165
00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:20.991
Damn!

166
00:12:22.785 --> 00:12:25.663
Let's go. Daz! Quit your damn cryin'!

167
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:28.040
R-Right...

168
00:12:28.249 --> 00:12:29.667
Eren.

169
00:12:30.251 --> 00:12:33.045
If the battle gets chaotic.
come find me.

170
00:12:33.254 --> 00:12:36.549
Huh? We're in different squads!

171
00:12:36.757 --> 00:12:40.052
If the situation falls apart.
things won't go according to plan.

172
00:12:40.261 --> 00:12:41.595
I'll protect you!

173
00:12:41.804 --> 00:12:42.763
What the hell are you...

174
00:12:42.972 --> 00:12:45.182
Cadet Ackermann.

175
00:12:45.391 --> 00:12:47.143
You're in the rearguard. Special orders.

176
00:12:47.351 --> 00:12:48.144
Come with me.

177
00:12:48.352 --> 00:12:51.230
I-I'm not skilled enough!
I'll only be a burden!

178
00:12:52.398 --> 00:12:54.984
I am not asking for your opinion.

179
00:12:55.192 --> 00:12:56.902
The citizens' evacuation
is behind schedule.

180
00:12:57.111 --> 00:13:00.030
We need as many elite
soldiers near them as possible.

181
00:13:00.239 --> 00:13:01.949
- B-But...!
- Hey!

182
00:13:03.242 --> 00:13:05.035
Cut the crap. Mikasa!

183
00:13:05.244 --> 00:13:07.580
Quit freaking out like everyone else!

184
00:13:07.788 --> 00:13:09.790
Humanity's on the
verge of extinction here!

185
00:13:09.999 --> 00:13:13.335
This is no time to go and
impose your own selfish rules!

186
00:13:17.089 --> 00:13:21.677
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking clearly.

187
00:13:22.887 --> 00:13:25.681
I do have one thing to ask.

188
00:13:28.726 --> 00:13:31.187
Please don't die.

189
00:13:38.194 --> 00:13:41.447
I ain't gonna die.

190
00:13:41.655 --> 00:13:43.949
<i>I can't</i> die yet!

191
00:13:46.619 --> 00:13:51.248
Because I still don't know
what this world is really like!

192
00:13:54.418 --> 00:13:59.632
Surviving historical documents
say nothing about the origin of the Titans.

193
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.510
Most everything remains unknown.

194
00:14:02.718 --> 00:14:05.721
The things we do know about now.
including Titan ecology.

195
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:09.725
are based entirely on the latest
reports from the Scout Regiment.

196
00:14:09.934 --> 00:14:13.896
We've been unable to determine if
the Titans possess human-like intelligence.

197
00:14:14.104 --> 00:14:19.443
As such. there've been <i>no</i> cases
to date of mutual communication.

198
00:14:19.652 --> 00:14:24.532
Titan physiology is fundamentally
different from that of other living beings.

199
00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.994
They lack reproductive organs.
and it is unclear how they reproduce.

200
00:14:29.203 --> 00:14:32.498
but they primarily possess male-like physiques.

201
00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:35.376
They have extremely
high body temperatures.

202
00:14:35.584 --> 00:14:40.673
and. perplexingly enough. they show
no interest in anything but humans.

203
00:14:41.966 --> 00:14:45.719
Consuming people is the
Titans' sole principle of behavior.

204
00:14:45.928 --> 00:14:52.268
but given that they've existed for over
a century in a human-less environment.

205
00:14:52.476 --> 00:14:57.231
we can surmise that the very act
of feeding is unnecessary for them.

206
00:14:57.439 --> 00:15:01.443
In other words. it's believed that
they are not motivated by predation.

207
00:15:01.652 --> 00:15:03.320
but by bloodlust.

208
00:15:04.613 --> 00:15:09.285
And. most of all. the Titans'
tremendous vitality is the primary reason

209
00:15:09.493 --> 00:15:13.122
that humankind has been
so greatly overwhelmed.

210
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.500
Humanity has long
possessed cannon technology.

211
00:15:16.709 --> 00:15:19.545
but that alone wasn't
enough to combat them.

212
00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:22.923
Even when their heads are
blown off. the Titans don't die.

213
00:15:23.132 --> 00:15:24.925
Additionally. although
there is some variability.

214
00:15:25.134 --> 00:15:28.554
their heads will fully regenerate
in only a minute or two.

215
00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:30.097
You can't be serious...

216
00:15:30.306 --> 00:15:32.141
Their size is bad enough as it is...

217
00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:35.436
Sir! Does that mean
the Titans are immortal?!

218
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.564
They are not immortal.

219
00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:41.900
There is one way to defeat a Titan.

220
00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:44.028
You target here.

221
00:15:44.236 --> 00:15:50.200
When severely damaged here.
a Titan will die without regenerating.

222
00:15:50.409 --> 00:15:54.955
That's where these two
flesh-paring blades come in.

223
00:15:55.164 --> 00:15:58.000
A successful strike to a
Titan's weak spot with these

224
00:15:58.208 --> 00:16:03.547
will cause its immediate death.
with no time to regenerate whatsoever.

225
00:16:10.512 --> 00:16:12.181
Hey. Armin.

226
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:14.975
This is the perfect chance. don't you think?

227
00:16:15.976 --> 00:16:20.731
If we take care of business in this first
battle before we've even joined the Scouts.

228
00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:25.319
we rookies will shoot up
the ranks for sure!

229
00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.453
Yeah. No question about it.

230
00:16:34.662 --> 00:16:37.706
Just so you know.
you aren't the only ones in our class

231
00:16:37.915 --> 00:16:39.708
who wanna join the Scouts.

232
00:16:39.917 --> 00:16:43.796
You beat us to the punch earlier.
but you won't outdo us this time!

233
00:16:44.004 --> 00:16:45.756
Sounds like a challenge. Thomas!

234
00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:49.009
Whoever takes out the most Titans wins!

235
00:16:49.218 --> 00:16:52.137
- Don't go messin' with the scores!
- Squad 34. move out!

236
00:16:52.346 --> 00:16:54.306
Bolster the vanguard!

237
00:16:55.349 --> 00:16:57.559
All right! Let's go!

238
00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:22.918
That many Titans?!

239
00:17:23.127 --> 00:17:25.421
The Vanguard's been totally routed!

240
00:17:25.629 --> 00:17:29.591
What are they doing?!
Those hot shots usually act all tough!

241
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:34.179
I figured things would
be bad. but not like this!

242
00:17:35.264 --> 00:17:37.057
An Abnormal!

243
00:17:37.266 --> 00:17:38.684
Stop!

244
00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:56.785
Huh...?

245
00:18:21.518 --> 00:18:23.771
What the hell are you doing?!

246
00:18:23.979 --> 00:18:26.690
- Eren!
- Don't go off on your own!

247
00:18:30.027 --> 00:18:32.696
Get back here. damn it!

248
00:18:32.905 --> 00:18:34.907
You're gonna pay for killing Thomas!

249
00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:39.161
I won't let you get away! I won't!

250
00:18:49.463 --> 00:18:50.672
Eren!

251
00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:52.424
Eren!

252
00:19:08.482 --> 00:19:12.110
Stop! Please don't!

253
00:19:18.075 --> 00:19:21.370
Why...?

254
00:19:21.578 --> 00:19:25.833
Why am I watching
as my friends get eaten?

255
00:19:32.548 --> 00:19:37.261
Why... can't I move...?

256
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.232
A-Armin...

257
00:19:51.984 --> 00:19:54.903
Eren! Eren!

258
00:19:55.112 --> 00:19:56.530
Eren!

259
00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.324
What is it. Armin?

260
00:19:59.533 --> 00:20:02.786
My grandpa secretly had this!

261
00:20:02.995 --> 00:20:06.206
It's a book about the outside world!

262
00:20:06.415 --> 00:20:08.750
A book about the outside world?!

263
00:20:08.959 --> 00:20:12.796
Isn't it illegal to have those?
You're gonna get arrested!

264
00:20:13.005 --> 00:20:15.799
This is no time to be saying that!

265
00:20:16.008 --> 00:20:16.967
According to this book.

266
00:20:17.175 --> 00:20:21.138
most of the world is covered
in water called a "sea"!

267
00:20:21.346 --> 00:20:23.974
And this "sea" is entirely saltwater!

268
00:20:24.182 --> 00:20:25.267
Salt?!

269
00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:28.854
Y-You're lying!
Salt is a treasure trove!

270
00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:31.398
I'm sure merchants
would've snatched it all up!

271
00:20:31.607 --> 00:20:34.276
You <i>can't</i>. though! The sea is that big!

272
00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:36.486
Yeah. right...

273
00:20:36.695 --> 00:20:39.239
There's a lot more than loads of salt. too!

274
00:20:39.448 --> 00:20:43.744
Fiery water! Lands of ice!
Sandy snowfields!

275
00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:46.038
The outside world
must be <i>many</i> times larger

276
00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:48.832
than the inside of these walls!

277
00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:51.376
The outside world...

278
00:20:51.585 --> 00:20:54.755
And. this is still a secret.

279
00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:59.760
but my mom and dad are planning
to venture into the outside world!

280
00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:02.137
The outside world. huh...

281
00:21:02.346 --> 00:21:04.097
Hey. Eren.

282
00:21:04.306 --> 00:21:09.394
I hope we can explore
the outside world too someday!

283
00:21:27.955 --> 00:21:29.373
Eren!

284
00:21:30.415 --> 00:21:34.419
I refuse to die here...

285
00:21:36.713 --> 00:21:40.217
Listen. Armin...

286
00:21:40.425 --> 00:21:44.721
You told me about it...

287
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:48.517
So I have... to see it...

288
00:21:48.725 --> 00:21:51.728
The outside world...!

289
00:21:53.063 --> 00:21:54.231
Eren!

290
00:21:54.439 --> 00:21:55.857
Hurry!

291
00:22:37.441 --> 00:22:42.362
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

292
00:22:42.571 --> 00:22:48.618
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

293
00:22:48.827 --> 00:22:53.290
<i>Over and over you cast them aside.
only to find more</i>

294
00:22:53.498 --> 00:22:59.963
<i>Now. rest in peace</i>

295
00:23:00.172 --> 00:23:11.308
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

296
00:23:11.516 --> 00:23:21.568
<i>and the more we forget
the more we remember again</i>

297
00:23:21.777 --> 00:23:27.532
<i>In this beautiful. cruel world</i>

298
00:23:27.741 --> 00:23:32.704
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

299
00:23:32.913 --> 00:23:38.418
<i>Oh. with our strength... and our weakness...</i>

300
00:23:38.627 --> 00:23:44.091
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

301
00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:47.719
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

302
00:23:54.643 --> 00:23:56.770
Suddenly. it begins to rain.

303
00:23:56.978 --> 00:23:58.814
The quiet sound of the rainfall...

304
00:23:59.022 --> 00:24:03.652
The damp air...
The faintly sweet smell of rain...

305
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.739
They remind Mikasa of
a ghastly incident in her past.
