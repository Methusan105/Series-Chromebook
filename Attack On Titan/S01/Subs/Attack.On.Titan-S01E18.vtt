﻿1
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.917
We will now begin the 57th
expedition beyond the walls!

2
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.125
Onward!

3
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.990
We believe that in the basement of
Eren Jaeger's Zhiganshina home.

4
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.057
there are answers about the Titans
that he himself doesn't have.

5
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.838
We will head there.

6
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.964
You new recruits will be here.

7
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.650
You'll be between the cart guard team

8
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.554
and the recon support team.

9
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.347
Your job will be to ride alongside the
spare horses and relay messages.

10
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.560
The Special Operations
Squad will be here.

11
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.195
Standing by in the center
of the last ranks.

12
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.324
It's the safest place in the formation.

13
00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:45.860
Special ops will be here.

14
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.780
That's no Aberrant.

15
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.870
It's intelligent!

16
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.290
Like the Armored or Colossal
Titans. or Eren...

17
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.960
A human in the body of a Titan!

18
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.550
Its movements are much more
precise than the others' are!

19
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:13.820
Damn it.

20
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.860
I...

21
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.380
I underestimated it!

22
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.260
It protected its neck...

23
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.510
Damn it! I can't get away!

24
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.500
Jean!

25
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.250
Avenge the bastard who
rushed to his death!

26
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.400
It stopped?

27
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.990
That's the one...

28
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.740
That's the one that killed him!

29
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.560
He rushed to his death
on the right flank!

30
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.960
Avenge him!

31
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.290
We've bought enough time. right?

32
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.090
Let's get the hell away from it!

33
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.730
No... Why?

34
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.360
Is it

35
00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:05.319
heading toward Eren?

36
00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:36.043

Forest of Giant Trees
57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (2)

38
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.210
How's your 3D Maneuver Gear looking. Armin?

39
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.170
It's okay...

40
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.710
The clasp released as intended.
so it seems it's not broken.

41
00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.380
I see...

42
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.630
I'm glad to hear it.

43
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.880
But what do we do?

44
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.720
We only have one horse.

45
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.390
If Jean's horse comes back.
the three of us can move. but...

46
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.270
Damn it. why?

47
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.780
Reiner's horse returned. so why didn't mine?

48
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.290
We can't stay here any longer.

49
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.620
In the worst case. we'll have
to leave someone here...

50
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.210
But how would we decide who to leave?

51
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.420
Armin. since he's wounded?

52
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.250
Reiner. since he's big and would have
trouble riding with someone else?

53
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.680
Or should I run and try to find my horse?

54
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.260
Damn it!

55
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.220
Why the hell do I have to think about this?!

56
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.220
We all made it through that fight alive.

57
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.560
This isn't fair...

58
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.410
Armin...

59
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.040
Hey. Armin!

60
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.360
Are you still out of it?

61
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.130
Yeah. my head's still a bit fuzzy...

62
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.510
I see...

63
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.970
But we must decide.

64
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.350
It's a hard choice. but someone
will have to stay behind.

65
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:37.440
Wait!

66
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.860
First. let's fire a smoke round...

67
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.900
If the formation continued straight ahead.

68
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.650
the row 4-3 team should be nearby.

69
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.950
That's the signal for an emergency...

70
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.190
But I can't imagine they'll understand
our intentions just from that.

71
00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.830
Armin. we can wait another three minutes.

72
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.750
By then. we must decide—

73
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:03.750
I'll stay.

74
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.550
But there's something I want
you to tell them for me...

75
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.180
Preferably to Commander Erwin alone—

76
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.470
No. Armin.

77
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.100
You should tell him yourself.

78
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.310
Looks like someone's here...

79
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.230
And with two horses!

80
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.150
That's...

81
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.820
Krista!

82
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.660
Is everyone okay?

83
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.290
That's my horse...

84
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:38.790
Whoa. whoa.

85
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.470
Calm down. Buchwald.

86
00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.410
He ran toward me. terrified...

87
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.590
Did you engage the Titans?

88
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.380
Armin. what happened to you?

89
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.510
Are you okay?

90
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.850
Yeah. I think so.

91
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.430
I can't believe that smoke
round brought you here.

92
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.350
I was nearby. and I already had Jean's horse.

93
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.860
Even horses like you.

94
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.860
It seems you have a strange charisma.

95
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:07.360
You saved our lives.

96
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.150
But I'm so glad

97
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.160
that the worst didn't happen to you.

98
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.450
I really am glad.

99
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.170
God...

100
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.400
A goddess.

101
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.690
I want to marry her.

102
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.510
Well. we should rejoin the
formation as soon as possible.

103
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.470
Yeah. there should be orders to retreat.

104
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:40.680
To think we've been pushed back.
less than an hour out of the walls.

105
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.150
Things are even bleaker
than I'd imagined...

106
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.640
And for some reason.

107
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.110
it went in the opposite direction from
the vanguard command team...

108
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.070
It?

109
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.600
A green round?

110
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.280
Looks like they're continuing the operation.

111
00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.990
only changing course...

112
00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.520
What?

113
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.330
That wasn't a retreat command?

114
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.920
What is Commander Erwin thinking?

115
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.750
In theory. any soldier has
the authority to determine

116
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.720
when mission completion
is no longer possible.

117
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.380
Did command not see our
smoke round somehow?

118
00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.620
Even if we don't know what's going on.

119
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.010
there's still only one thing for us to do...

120
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:18.910
Follow the order!

121
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.400
Smoke round.

122
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:28.900
Green.

123
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.150
Oluo. you fire it.

124
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:32.570
Roger.

125
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.030
For now. everything seems to be going fine.

126
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.630
But is it really?

127
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.250
We may already have casualties
on the front lines.

128
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.290
Reporting!

129
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.290
Message to pass along!

130
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.630
Right flank recon has been destroyed!

131
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.170
Our recon system is partially inoperative.

132
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.550
Pass this on. to the left.

133
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.300
Did you hear that. Petra?

134
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.600
Go.

135
00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.560
Yes. Captain.

136
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.560
The right flank?!

137
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.350
I think that's where Armin is.

138
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:11.170
But Armin and the others should still
be in position. near the center.

139
00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:13.520
The Titans can't have made it in that far...

140
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:16.860
A black round?

141
00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.700
Aberrants?

142
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.990
Eren. you fire it.

143
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.320
R-Right!

144
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.410
What a mess.

145
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.330
We let it penetrate deep into our formation.

146
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.800
It's almost here...

147
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.170
The Titan.

148
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:38.260
Beneath those smoke rounds.
is there someone fighting?

149
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:51.770
Damn it...

150
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.570
Look over here.

151
00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.860
You monster...

152
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.580
Now!

153
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.810
Three separate attacks at once...

154
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.590
You're pretty smart. but you can't
possibly protect all three targets!

155
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.550
Spine. Achilles tendon...

156
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.880
It doesn't matter!

157
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.970
Hit one. and we will slow it down...

158
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.640
Go!

159
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.060
Damn you for causing so many deaths!

160
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.060
We'll make you die a slow. painful death!

161
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.610
It jumped?

162
00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.580
L-Let me go!

163
00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.200
The most important thing is
to ensure they hear of this...

164
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.580
I must tell them what we're up against!

165
00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.090
An Aberrant?!

166
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.840
It got in all the way here?

167
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:38.290
We'll take it out!

168
00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:40.670
We can't let it penetrate any farther!

169
00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.740
The right flank's been wiped out?

170
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.350
But we aren't withdrawing?

171
00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.240
Why?!

172
00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.490
No idea...

173
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.950
The Commander's orders...

174
00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:06.780
Just relay the message to the left!

175
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.090
What's going on?

176
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.210
We keep heading east.

177
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.090
Our goal is supposed to
be south. to the old city.

178
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.409
Right now. our formation's

179
00:12:26.434 --> 00:12:28.010
on a collision course.

180
00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:28.850
Yeah.

181
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:30.680
You can see it...

182
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.069
The forest of giant trees!

183
00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.570
Seems Titans passed through here.

184
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.160
There's nothing growing on the road.

185
00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:52.210
We can bring the carts through. too.

186
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.280
Send word to the rear

187
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.630
that only the central cart guard
should enter the forest.

188
00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:00.590
Yes. sir!

189
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.010
Excuse me. sir...

190
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.470
The center row appears to
be entering the forest.

191
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.590
but wouldn't the rest of
us collide with the forest?

192
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.280
We're going around.

193
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.100
Yes. sir!

194
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:35.460
Hey. what are we doing at this tourist spot?

195
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:40.170
We're totally off from both our original
destination and our return point.

196
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.960
I don't know...

197
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.890
I don't know. but the order came from
Commander Erwin. after all.

198
00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.600
He must have a plan.

199
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:50.930
What kind of plan?

200
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.480
Are they planning to hold a welcome ceremony

201
00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.760
for us new recruits at a tourist spot?

202
00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.310
No. I don't think so.

203
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:59.440
That was a joke.

204
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:03.530
Anyway. that giant woman's following us.

205
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:08.200
No matter what his plan. we can't stay here.

206
00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.370
The only thing I can imagine

207
00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:13.330
is that we're passing through
on our way to somewhere else...

208
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.330
Everyone. halt!

209
00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.550
All right. Listen up. recruits.

210
00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.550
We will now make preparations
to launch a counterattack.

211
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.550
Draw your blades. and wait above in the trees.

212
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.550
If any Titans try to enter this forest.
stop them at all costs!

213
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:34.120
U-Um. Sir. what do you—

214
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.730
Shut up and follow orders!

215
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.800
Seriously?

216
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.400
What's going on?

217
00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:52.580
H-Hey. it looks like only the center
line went into the woods.

218
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.090
What happened to the formation?

219
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.250
It's gone.

220
00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:59.700
The forest blocks our advance.
 so the left and right flanks

221
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.840
will have to skirt the forest.

222
00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.340
We've lost our recon ability.

223
00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.340
Why didn't we change course
to avoid this forest?

224
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.510
Did Commander Erwin read the map wrong?

225
00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.380
I don't know...

226
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.640
Perhaps we tried too hard to avoid the threat

227
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.220
on the right flank and ended up here...

228
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.780
This is insane...

229
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:35.290
We've abandoned the original
mission to cache supplies.

230
00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.330
And when we abandoned it.
we should've turned tail and run...

231
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.540
But instead. we're forging
ahead to a tourist trap.

232
00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.920
And now. we're just standing here.

233
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.760
to stop any Titans that enter the woods?

234
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:56.100
Damn him for giving a crazy order.

235
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:57.890
He'll hear you...

236
00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:01.730
And this no real explanation
thing is innovative. too.

237
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:05.780
Of course. I'm sure he has his own concerns...

238
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.110
What do you mean?

239
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:12.050
A commander deemed worthless
by his men in a critical situation

240
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.990
quite often succumbs to a
mysterious attack from behind.

241
00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.120
I'm just saying it wouldn't surprise me.

242
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.380
Jean. so what are you going to do?

243
00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.000
Don't be so serious...

244
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:28.130
This situation's got me a
bit worked up. that's all.

245
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.730
What am I going to do?

246
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:35.430
Obey my orders. and keep
Titans out of the forest.

247
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.430
You also think it's the right move. don't you?

248
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.390
Ah—

249
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.190
You look like you know something.

250
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.190
Well...

251
00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.310
Five-meter class incoming!

252
00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:59.340
Why bring the formation here?

253
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.420
What is Commander Erwin thinking?

254
00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:07.920
No. that isn't what
we should think about.

255
00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.010
The Female Titan is pursuing Eren.

256
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:13.930
And the Commander knows that.

257
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.930
Assume those two things.
and see what you can deduce...

258
00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.220
Captain...

259
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.850
Captain Levi!

260
00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.390
What?

261
00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.150
Well...

262
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:26.710
We're in the middle of the woods!

263
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.940
If the center enters alone.

264
00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.990
we won't know if Titans are approaching!

265
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:34.530
It seems something's approaching '
us from the right...

266
00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.830
How are we supposed to dodge
the Titans or protect the carts?

267
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.750
Don't go on and on about the obvious...

268
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.420
We can't do that anymore. of course.

269
00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.080
Th-Then why?

270
00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.250
Look around. Eren...

271
00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.840
At all these big-ass trees.

272
00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:58.050
It's the perfect environment
for 3D Maneuver Gear.

273
00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:03.500
And try to use that tiny brain of yours...

274
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.690
If you don't want to die. think.

275
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:08.310
Yes. sir!

276
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.610
I see.

277
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:14.420
I just can't keep up right now
because I'm still new.

278
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:17.480
He won't just tell me the answer.

279
00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.860
I have to figure it out for myself.

280
00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:24.290
I'm sure that's how they all learned to fight.

281
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:27.810
What the hell?

282
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:29.380
Seriously?

283
00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:33.380
Damn it all... What the hell is going on here?

284
00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.260
Wait!

285
00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:43.030
Wait a minute... No one knows
what's really going on?

286
00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.970
Maybe not even Captain Levi?

287
00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:51.940
The Female Titan is after Eren...

288
00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:54.570
If I'm right about that.

289
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.780
then there's only one reason to come here.

290
00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:01.620
This is where Commander Erwin intends
to deal with the Female Titan...

291
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:02.660
Armin...

292
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:08.710
Our orders were to keep the
Titans out of the forest. right?

293
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:11.920
In other words...

294
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.720
There's no longer any reason to fight...

295
00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.010
Right?

296
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.340
A black smoke round?

297
00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:54.960
It's from directly behind us!

298
00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.640
It's whatever was coming
toward us on the right.

299
00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.800
Draw your blades.

300
00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:07.560
If we see it. it'll only be for a second.

301
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:32.660
Go!

302
00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:48.640
It's fast!

303
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.640
In these trees. there's no way to
foresee and evade its attacks!

304
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.690
It'll catch us!

305
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.860
Captain. let's switch to Maneuver Gear!

306
00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.520
Captain!

307
00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.360
You won't escape!

308
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:02.360
Reinforcements from the rear!

309
00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.260
Captain. your orders?!

310
00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:21.510
Let's go for it!

311
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:22.760
It's dangerous...

312
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.180
We should kill it!

313
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.310
I'll rip you apart!

314
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.480
Fool. you've run straight into hell.

315
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:37.640
You're chasing a group of master 
Titan killers!

316
00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.710
Captain Levi?

317
00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:43.860
Captain!

318
00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.470
Give us your orders.

319
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:47.680
At this rate. it <i>will</i> catch up with us!

320
00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.130
We kill it here...

321
00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:51.070
That's why we came to this forest!

322
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:53.000
Right. Captain?

323
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.040
Captain. your orders!

324
00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.500
Everyone. cover your ears.
