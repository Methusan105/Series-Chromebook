1
00:00:01.711 --> 00:00:04.381
Attention!

2
00:00:05.298 --> 00:00:09.969
I will now explain to you the details
of the Trost Recovery Operation!

3
00:00:10.178 --> 00:00:12.931
Let me start by introducing this fellow!

4
00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.769
This is Eren Jaeger.
a member of the Cadets!

5
00:00:17.977 --> 00:00:20.438
He is the successful result

6
00:00:20.647 --> 00:00:24.109
of our top-secret Titan
transformation experiments!

7
00:00:24.317 --> 00:00:29.030
In Titan form. he will lift that
giant rock near the front gate.

8
00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.199
carry it to the wrecked gate.

9
00:00:31.408 --> 00:00:33.243
and seal the hole!

10
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:35.412
As for you.

11
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.126
you're to defend him from the
other Titans while he carries the rock!

12
00:00:41.334 --> 00:00:43.920
Should this operation succeed.

13
00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.926
humanity will have taken back land
from the Titans for the very first time!

14
00:00:50.135 --> 00:00:54.806
Indeed. it may
seem extraordinarily small

15
00:00:55.014 --> 00:00:58.852
when compared to what
humanity has given up this far!

16
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.437
However...!

17
00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:04.149
For humankind.
that single. small step...

18
00:01:04.357 --> 00:01:06.443
...will be a great leap forward!

19
00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:23.042
Eren! Don't you recognize me?!

20
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:24.878
I'm Mikasa!

21
00:01:25.086 --> 00:01:27.338
Part of your family!

22
00:01:27.547 --> 00:01:29.466
Dodge. Ackermann!

23
00:01:32.802 --> 00:01:34.179
What the hell?!

24
00:01:34.387 --> 00:01:37.182
He's just a regular. dumb Titan!

25
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.767
Change of plans!

26
00:01:38.975 --> 00:01:42.645
We're to defend Jaeger from the
other Titans until we can recover him!

27
00:01:42.854 --> 00:01:45.565
He holds a precious chance for humanity.

28
00:01:45.774 --> 00:01:48.318
We can't abandon him just like that!

29
00:01:50.737 --> 00:01:52.572
Where am I?

30
00:01:56.117 --> 00:01:57.744
I'm home...

31
00:01:59.704 --> 00:02:00.789
Jean!

32
00:02:00.997 --> 00:02:03.541
Why isn't he using his ODM gear?!

33
00:02:04.542 --> 00:02:05.460
Oh no!

34
00:02:05.668 --> 00:02:07.670
Don't tell me it's malfunctioning?!

35
00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:09.255
I'll manage somehow!

36
00:02:09.464 --> 00:02:10.840
Mikasa!

37
00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:12.217
What happened to the plan?!

38
00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:13.635
It's failed!

39
00:02:13.843 --> 00:02:17.096
We're fighting because
we can't leave Eren behind!

40
00:02:17.305 --> 00:02:19.432
But there are too many Titans...

41
00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:22.060
At this rate. we'll be wiped out!

42
00:02:25.063 --> 00:02:27.232
From the back of the head
to the nape of the neck...

43
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.361
...one meter high and
ten centimeters across!

44
00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:36.199
Eren... Answer me...

45
00:02:36.407 --> 00:02:41.496
Even though just one step outside
the wall lies a hellish world...

46
00:02:41.704 --> 00:02:47.043
Why did you want to
venture into the outside world?!

47
00:02:48.878 --> 00:02:50.296
Why?

48
00:02:51.756 --> 00:02:52.924
Because...

49
00:02:53.132 --> 00:02:55.593
...I was born in this world!

50
00:03:04.227 --> 00:03:05.645
Eren!

51
00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:29.127
<i>Unknown are the names
of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

52
00:03:29.335 --> 00:03:34.591
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth
and long for the wind</i>

53
00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.679
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

54
00:03:39.888 --> 00:03:45.018
<i>Only the will to fight
can change the here and now!</i>

55
00:03:45.226 --> 00:03:50.315
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve
to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

56
00:03:50.523 --> 00:03:52.859
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

57
00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:55.737
<i>Give us the freedom of dying.
starving wolves!</i>

58
00:03:55.945 --> 00:04:01.117
<i>The humiliation of being caged
is what triggers us to fight back</i>

59
00:04:01.326 --> 00:04:06.414
<i>We hunters slaughter prey
beyond the castle walls.</i>

60
00:04:06.623 --> 00:04:11.628
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust.</i>

61
00:04:11.836 --> 00:04:18.760
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows
pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

62
00:04:53.795 --> 00:04:58.299
Damn... I can't believe I'm
draggin' everyone down...

63
00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.232
Will this really work out somehow?

64
00:05:20.196 --> 00:05:22.448
We can't go on. Captain!

65
00:05:23.032 --> 00:05:25.868
It's just us now!

66
00:05:27.412 --> 00:05:29.580
Let's fall back to the rock for now!

67
00:05:34.877 --> 00:05:36.504
Situation report!

68
00:05:36.963 --> 00:05:39.257
Five Titans coming from the gate!

69
00:05:50.852 --> 00:05:54.313
There's no way I can just sit
around and wait until the coast is clear!

70
00:05:54.522 --> 00:05:55.898
Jean!

71
00:05:56.107 --> 00:05:58.359
So his gear is busted!

72
00:05:58.568 --> 00:06:00.194
What's going on?!

73
00:06:02.238 --> 00:06:03.156
Crap!

74
00:06:03.364 --> 00:06:04.657
What the hell?!

75
00:06:04.866 --> 00:06:07.952
Damn it! Of all the times...!

76
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:12.331
Jean! Stay calm!

77
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:16.586
Marco!

78
00:06:16.794 --> 00:06:18.629
What are you doing?!

79
00:06:29.932 --> 00:06:30.933
Man!

80
00:06:31.142 --> 00:06:33.061
Don't go causin' trouble for us!

81
00:06:43.654 --> 00:06:47.742
Damn! Why is the trigger so stiff?!

82
00:06:51.329 --> 00:06:52.747
Jean!

83
00:06:56.501 --> 00:06:57.919
Oww!

84
00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:00.213
What are you doing?!

85
00:07:00.421 --> 00:07:03.174
Same to you! Now get outta there!

86
00:07:35.706 --> 00:07:36.916
You guys are damn reckless!

87
00:07:37.125 --> 00:07:38.459
No. you are!

88
00:07:38.668 --> 00:07:40.711
That scared the hell out of me!

89
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.048
Look!

90
00:08:18.708 --> 00:08:19.917
Eren...

91
00:08:20.126 --> 00:08:21.544
Mikasa!

92
00:08:23.504 --> 00:08:24.547
Armin!

93
00:08:24.755 --> 00:08:26.382
Eren prevailed!

94
00:08:26.591 --> 00:08:29.927
He's trying to fulfill
his responsibility now!

95
00:08:30.136 --> 00:08:33.306
Now if we just cover
him until he reaches the gate...

96
00:08:33.514 --> 00:08:35.892
...victory will be ours!

97
00:08:40.438 --> 00:08:42.064
Defend him!

98
00:08:42.607 --> 00:08:45.067
Even if it costs us our lives...

99
00:08:45.276 --> 00:08:47.528
...we <i>must</i> let Eren reach the gate!

100
00:08:47.737 --> 00:08:51.282
Do not let the Titans get near him!

101
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:55.161
We gotta give Eren backup! Keep 'em off him!

102
00:08:57.496 --> 00:09:00.583
You two head to Eren!

103
00:09:00.791 --> 00:09:03.461
That's an order! Is that clear?!

104
00:09:03.669 --> 00:09:05.087
Yes. Sir!

105
00:09:08.841 --> 00:09:09.967
The Mitabi team!

106
00:09:10.176 --> 00:09:11.677
What are you doing?!

107
00:09:11.886 --> 00:09:14.013
The Titans are ignoring us now!

108
00:09:14.222 --> 00:09:17.475
Our only choice is to get close
enough to grab their attention!

109
00:09:17.683 --> 00:09:19.435
Look this way. damn it!

110
00:09:19.644 --> 00:09:24.732
Or else we'll shove our blades
up your smelly asses and kill you!

111
00:09:27.985 --> 00:09:29.987
- Here they come!
- We got two of 'em!

112
00:09:30.196 --> 00:09:33.074
Run! Run for the buildings!

113
00:09:33.282 --> 00:09:34.450
That's insane!

114
00:09:34.659 --> 00:09:37.078
Setting foot down there is suicide!

115
00:09:37.286 --> 00:09:40.456
And they have no way to
fight without horses or buildings!

116
00:09:40.665 --> 00:09:45.670
No... That's the only option now.

117
00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:50.716
Follow Mitabi Team!

118
00:09:50.925 --> 00:09:53.386
Armin. We need to go. too.

119
00:09:56.013 --> 00:09:56.806
This way!

120
00:09:57.014 --> 00:09:58.975
Come get me!

121
00:10:06.607 --> 00:10:08.359
My body feels...

122
00:10:08.567 --> 00:10:11.696
...like it's about to be crushed into a pulp...

123
00:10:13.114 --> 00:10:16.409
Mikasa... Armin...

124
00:10:16.617 --> 00:10:17.868
What are you doing?

125
00:10:18.077 --> 00:10:22.290
You'll end up Titan food if
you walk around down there...!

126
00:10:22.498 --> 00:10:25.459
C'mon! Hurry this way. you slowpoke!

127
00:10:25.668 --> 00:10:27.086
Come get me!

128
00:10:29.755 --> 00:10:31.173
H-Hey!

129
00:10:32.717 --> 00:10:34.135
Mitabi!

130
00:10:40.057 --> 00:10:41.434
Why did you want

131
00:10:41.642 --> 00:10:44.520
to venture into
the outside world?

132
00:10:47.606 --> 00:10:52.320
From the moment
we're born. we're all...

133
00:10:52.528 --> 00:10:53.946
...free...

134
00:10:56.365 --> 00:11:02.330
Some might try to deny that.
but it doesn't matter how strong they are!

135
00:11:03.372 --> 00:11:08.878
Fiery waters... Lands of ice...
Or whatever else!

136
00:11:09.086 --> 00:11:11.339
Whoever gets to see those things

137
00:11:11.547 --> 00:11:15.634
will have the greatest
freedom this world has to offer!

138
00:11:17.345 --> 00:11:19.096
Fight!

139
00:11:19.305 --> 00:11:22.058
If anything is worth
giving your life. it's that!

140
00:11:24.352 --> 00:11:28.481
It doesn't matter how
terrifying the world may be!

141
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:35.446
It doesn't matter
how cruel the world may be!

142
00:11:36.238 --> 00:11:37.656
Fight!

143
00:11:38.282 --> 00:11:39.700
Fight!

144
00:11:40.409 --> 00:11:41.827
Fight!

145
00:11:42.453 --> 00:11:43.871
Fight!

146
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.377
There's still a Titan ahead!

147
00:11:51.045 --> 00:11:53.005
I'll handle this!

148
00:11:55.424 --> 00:11:58.177
Out of the way!

149
00:12:20.074 --> 00:12:23.369
Go. Eren!

150
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:25.788
Fight!

151
00:12:51.397 --> 00:12:52.982
Everyone...

152
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.694
Your deaths weren't in vain...

153
00:13:02.116 --> 00:13:05.828
Today. for the first time in history...

154
00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:08.706
...humanity has beaten the Titans!

155
00:13:08.914 --> 00:13:10.958
Yellow smoke shell spotted!

156
00:13:11.167 --> 00:13:14.670
It seems the operation...
was a success!

157
00:13:15.921 --> 00:13:18.340
Send in additional reinforcements!

158
00:13:18.549 --> 00:13:21.302
Rescue the Elite Squad!

159
00:13:37.902 --> 00:13:40.279
The remaining Titans are coming!

160
00:13:40.488 --> 00:13:42.072
Head up the wall!

161
00:13:42.281 --> 00:13:44.783
I'll withdraw after I've recovered Eren!

162
00:13:46.577 --> 00:13:48.579
Armin! How's Eren?!

163
00:13:48.787 --> 00:13:51.499
He's unbelievably hot to the touch!

164
00:13:51.707 --> 00:13:55.503
We need to hurry...
and get him up the wall...!

165
00:13:58.339 --> 00:14:01.050
Part of his body is fused to it!

166
00:14:01.258 --> 00:14:03.969
- I can't pull him free!
- Then we'll have to cut!

167
00:14:04.178 --> 00:14:06.597
W-Wait! Please!

168
00:14:18.609 --> 00:14:20.778
Eren! Armin!

169
00:14:40.923 --> 00:14:42.341
Mikasa...

170
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:43.342
Huh?!

171
00:14:43.551 --> 00:14:45.052
Those are...

172
00:14:47.596 --> 00:14:49.807
The wings...

173
00:14:50.015 --> 00:14:51.850
...of freedom...

174
00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.609
Hey. You kids.

175
00:15:00.818 --> 00:15:03.904
What exactly is going on here?

176
00:15:09.577 --> 00:15:11.829
Afterward. thanks to the actions

177
00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:16.375
of the Scout Regiment and the
Garrison Regiment's Corps of Engineers.

178
00:15:16.584 --> 00:15:20.879
Wall Rose once
again held the Titans at bay.

179
00:15:23.924 --> 00:15:29.597
Taking out the rest of the Titans
trapped inside Trost took a full day.

180
00:15:29.805 --> 00:15:34.018
during which the wall-mounted
cannons fired nonstop.

181
00:15:36.145 --> 00:15:38.314
Most of the Titans that
had gathered by the wall

182
00:15:38.522 --> 00:15:40.608
were wiped out by explosive shells.

183
00:15:40.816 --> 00:15:46.614
The few that remained were
mostly mopped up by the Scouts.

184
00:15:48.657 --> 00:15:53.245
During this. one 4-meter
Titan and one 7-meter Titan

185
00:15:53.454 --> 00:15:56.832
were successfully captured alive.

186
00:15:57.041 --> 00:15:58.792
However...

187
00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:02.421
207 people were dead or missing.

188
00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:05.633
and 897 were injured.

189
00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:10.012
Although this was the first time
humanity had stopped a Titan invasion.

190
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:16.727
far too many people had been lost
to celebrate this historic achievement.

191
00:16:37.164 --> 00:16:38.582
Hey...

192
00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:46.298
Are you...

193
00:16:46.507 --> 00:16:48.592
...Marco?

194
00:16:51.512 --> 00:16:54.723
Do you know his name. cadet?

195
00:16:54.932 --> 00:16:56.350
I <i>wondered</i> where he was...

196
00:16:56.558 --> 00:17:01.522
But... he's the last person who would ever...

197
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.440
Marco...

198
00:17:03.649 --> 00:17:05.234
What happened?

199
00:17:06.402 --> 00:17:11.323
D-Did someone... anyone...
see how he went out?

200
00:17:11.532 --> 00:17:13.033
What is his name?

201
00:17:13.242 --> 00:17:16.036
Tell me if you know. Quickly.

202
00:17:18.997 --> 00:17:21.250
Do you understand. cadet?

203
00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:24.545
Two days have passed since
we sealed the hole with the rock.

204
00:17:24.753 --> 00:17:28.257
Yet we <i>still</i> haven't
rounded up all the bodies.

205
00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:32.177
At this rate.
an epidemic could break out.

206
00:17:32.386 --> 00:17:35.347
We <i>must</i> prevent a secondary disaster.

207
00:17:35.556 --> 00:17:38.767
There's no time to lament our
comrades' deaths yet.

208
00:17:38.976 --> 00:17:40.602
Understand?

209
00:17:44.565 --> 00:17:50.571
Member of the 104th Cadet Corps
and Captain of Squad 19...

210
00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:53.240
...Marco Bodt.

211
00:17:53.449 --> 00:17:54.575
Marco.

212
00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:57.077
I'm glad you knew his name.

213
00:17:57.286 --> 00:17:59.246
Let's continue.

214
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:11.884
What is this...?

215
00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:16.263
Leftover Titan vomit.

216
00:18:16.472 --> 00:18:18.515
Apparently they don't
have digestive systems.

217
00:18:18.724 --> 00:18:22.895
so they puke people out like
that once they've had their fill.

218
00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:24.938
You can't be serious...

219
00:18:25.147 --> 00:18:29.693
Damn... There's no way of
telling who's who in there!

220
00:18:33.238 --> 00:18:34.865
I'm sorry...

221
00:18:38.285 --> 00:18:40.579
I'm sorry...

222
00:18:40.788 --> 00:18:42.956
It's no use apologizing.

223
00:18:43.165 --> 00:18:45.375
We need to hurry and give them a funeral.

224
00:19:10.609 --> 00:19:13.070
Have any questions?

225
00:19:14.196 --> 00:19:19.493
Commander Erwin. the head of
the Scouts Regiment's Task Force...

226
00:19:20.661 --> 00:19:22.663
...and Captain Levi!

227
00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:24.998
U-Umm...

228
00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:30.629
Where... am I?

229
00:19:35.551 --> 00:19:39.721
It should be obvious.
Let's just say it's a dungeon.

230
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:43.559
You're currently in the
custody of the Military Police.

231
00:19:43.767 --> 00:19:48.230
Only just now were
we permitted to see you.

232
00:19:50.899 --> 00:19:51.859
That key...!

233
00:19:52.067 --> 00:19:54.528
Yes. It's yours.

234
00:19:54.736 --> 00:19:56.446
I'll return it later.

235
00:19:56.655 --> 00:20:01.577
Dr. Jaeger's basement.
in your home in Shiganshina...

236
00:20:01.785 --> 00:20:05.330
A secret surrounding
the Titans is there. correct?

237
00:20:05.539 --> 00:20:07.708
Yes. I think so.

238
00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:10.127
That's what my father said.

239
00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:14.423
And you've lost your memory.
and your old man's gone missing...

240
00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:17.301
Pretty convenient story. if you ask me.

241
00:20:17.509 --> 00:20:18.886
Levi.

242
00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:23.015
We've already concluded he
has no reason to lie. You know that.

243
00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:25.225
There is still so little we know.

244
00:20:25.434 --> 00:20:29.730
but for now. I feel the most important
thing is to ask about your intentions.

245
00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:32.691
My intentions?

246
00:20:33.567 --> 00:20:35.777
If we want to check out your home.

247
00:20:35.986 --> 00:20:40.157
we'll need to take back
Shiganshina District along Wall Maria.

248
00:20:41.116 --> 00:20:46.371
Sealing the damaged gate there would
be the best way to accomplish that.

249
00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.416
Which means we'll need your Titan ability.

250
00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:54.838
Naturally. it's a Titan
that will determine our fate.

251
00:20:55.047 --> 00:20:58.300
The Colossal Titan
and the Armored Titan

252
00:20:58.508 --> 00:21:01.303
most likely work the same way as you.

253
00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:05.349
Your intentions are the key.

254
00:21:05.557 --> 00:21:09.811
The key to saving humankind from this despair.

255
00:21:12.397 --> 00:21:14.024
I'm...

256
00:21:17.986 --> 00:21:20.364
I'm going to drive out...

257
00:21:20.572 --> 00:21:24.952
...every last one from this world!

258
00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.455
Hey. Answer the damn question. you twit.

259
00:21:28.664 --> 00:21:31.291
What do you want to do?

260
00:21:35.629 --> 00:21:38.090
I want to join the Scouts...

261
00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:41.677
...and slaughter every Titan I can!

262
00:21:43.387 --> 00:21:46.223
Ah. Not bad.

263
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:54.314
Erwin. I'll take responsibility for him.

264
00:21:54.523 --> 00:21:56.817
Let the higher-ups know.

265
00:21:57.025 --> 00:21:59.987
I don't necessarily trust him. though.

266
00:22:00.195 --> 00:22:02.406
If he betrays us or goes out of control.

267
00:22:02.614 --> 00:22:05.117
I'll kill him on the spot.

268
00:22:05.325 --> 00:22:07.285
The top brass won't complain.

269
00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:10.414
Because I'm the only one cut out for this.

270
00:22:10.622 --> 00:22:12.499
You're in.

271
00:22:12.708 --> 00:22:16.044
I'll make you a member of the Scouts.

272
00:22:37.357 --> 00:22:42.279
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

273
00:22:42.487 --> 00:22:48.535
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

274
00:22:48.744 --> 00:22:53.206
<i>Over and over you cast them aside.
only to find more</i>

275
00:22:53.415 --> 00:22:59.880
<i>Now. rest in peace</i>

276
00:23:00.088 --> 00:23:11.224
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

277
00:23:11.433 --> 00:23:21.485
<i>and the more we forget
the more we remember again</i>

278
00:23:21.693 --> 00:23:27.449
<i>In this beautiful. cruel world</i>

279
00:23:27.657 --> 00:23:32.621
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

280
00:23:32.829 --> 00:23:38.335
<i>Oh. with our strength... and our weakness...</i>

281
00:23:38.543 --> 00:23:44.007
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

282
00:23:44.216 --> 00:23:47.636
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

283
00:23:54.476 --> 00:23:56.728
A special court-martial.

284
00:23:56.937 --> 00:23:59.523
After being held in an underground cell.

285
00:23:59.731 --> 00:24:03.151
Eren is dragged into a courthouse
filled with the heads of each regiment.

286
00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.781
What happens there will
determine whether he lives or dies.

9999
00:00:0.500 --> 00:00:2.00
