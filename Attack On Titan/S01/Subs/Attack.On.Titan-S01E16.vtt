18
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.485
What to do now?

19
00:01:32.486 --> 00:01:34.990
Prelude to the Counterattack (pt 3)

20
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.049
When did you last change shafts?

21
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.309
Six days ago.

22
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.660
After the clean-up operation.

23
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.499
That matches the records.

24
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.549
Okay. next.

25
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.170
You are?

26
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.550
Krista Lenz. Squad 42.

27
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.969
Check it for wear.

28
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.859
Who'd have thought killing Titans
was a punishable offense...

29
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.739
It <i>does</i> seem ironic. but those
two were valuable test subjects.

30
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.009
Even so. why are they looking for
the culprit among us trainees?

31
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.919
We just finished cleaning
up the battlefield today.

32
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.570
Everyone's totally beat.

33
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.469
The culprit must've really loathed the Titans.

34
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.330
Yeah.

35
00:02:17.331 --> 00:02:21.419
But in reality. they ended
up helping the Titans...

36
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.779
They may have fulfilled their
personal desire for vengeance.

37
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.010
but the net result is a
major setback for humanity.

38
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.219
I think I get why they did it.
because I can be an idiot myself...

39
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.049
Before I'd ever seen a Titan.

40
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.110
I was certain I wanted
to join the Recon Corps.

41
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.080
But now. I never want to see another.

42
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.880
And today. we all have to
decide which force to join.

43
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.380
<i>Even Jean's seriously...</i>

44
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.900
<i>Everyone's regretting it.</i>

45
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.359
<i>If I'd known it'd be this hellish.</i>

46
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.250
<i>I'd have never chosen to be a soldier.</i>

47
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.959
<i>Now I'm so exhausted.</i>

48
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.930
<i>I can't think of anything else...</i>

49
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.560
Hey. Marco...

50
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.610
I can't even tell which
are your bones anymore.

51
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.159
<i>If I hadn't become a soldier.</i>

52
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.360
<i>I wouldn't have to keep wondering
who'll be on that pile next.</i>

53
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.169
Will we abandon the tactical progress
bought by tens of thousands of sacrifices.

54
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.960
just to serve ourselves
up on a silver platter?

55
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.820
<i>I know we have to fight...</i>

56
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.260
<i>But not everyone's as eager to die as you are.</i>

57
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.560
I hope you won't get upset when I say this...

58
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.570
But you aren't a strong person. Jean.

59
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.070
So you can relate to the feelings of the weak.

60
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.629
What's more. you excel at
sizing up any situation.

61
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.810
Isn't that why you already
know what needs to be done?

62
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.200
What needs to be done...

63
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.880
Hey. guys...

64
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.130
Have you decided which force you're joining?

65
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.020
I've made up my mind..

66
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.100
I...

67
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.640
I...

68
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.940
I'm joining the Recon Corps!

69
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.700
Damn it.

70
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.359
Hey. Annie. What do you think?

71
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.979
Even Jean said he's joining the Recon Corps.

72
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.789
Huh? Jean said that?

73
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:21.710
I have no opinion.

74
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.619
You're joining the Military Police. right?

75
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.220
Maybe I should too.

76
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.659
If someone told you to die. would you do it?

77
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.459
What? Of course not.

78
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.730
Then why not make your own decision?

79
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.950
Armin. what about you?

80
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:44.740
I...

81
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.859
I think if you know why you have to die.

82
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.490
there are times when you
must lay down your life.

83
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.519
Not that I want to die.

84
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.799
I see. You've made your choice.

85
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.750
Yeah.

86
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.019
I've been thinking it over
for quite a long time.

87
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.470
Seriously? Armin. you too?

88
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.260
You're weak. but you've got guts.

89
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.760
Th-Thank you.

90
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.200
Annie. you're actually
pretty nice. aren't you?

91
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.520
It seems like you don't want
us to join the Recon Corps.

92
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.900
Do you have a reason you want
to join the Military Police?

93
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.880
Not really.

94
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.820
It's just...

95
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.280
I want to survive.

96
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.199
It looks like they couldn't
find any soldiers who used

97
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.199
their Maneuver Gear without permission.

98
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.479
Then who did it?

99
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.019
No idea...

100
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.180
Right now. I'm more worried about
the upcoming induction ceremony.

101
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.660
How many of the new cadets are
actually crazy enough to join us?

102
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.959
Hey. Eren.

103
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.369
Are there any people in
your class who'd join us?

104
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.270
There are some.

105
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.090
No. there <i>were</i> some.

106
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.020
I don't know about now.

107
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.360
Attention!

108
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.399
Get ready.

109
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.400
We're going out on patrol.

110
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:17.629
Yes. sir!

111
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.989
Good morning. Captain Levi!

112
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.179
Listen. Eren...

113
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.469
Never stray more than two
horse-lengths from me.

114
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.229
Don't forget that the only reason

115
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.859
you're not locked up is
because I'm watching you.

116
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:28.850
Yes. sir!

117
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:29.820
Let's go.

118
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.180
Jean...

119
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.289
You're really joining the Recon Corps?

120
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:04.880
Yeah.

121
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.959
Why the sudden choice?

122
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.059
I mean... Aren't you scared?

123
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:10.690
Huh?

124
00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:13.269
Of course I don't <i>want
</i> to join the Recon Corps.

125
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.559
Th-Then why...

126
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.719
It's not that the Titans don't
scare me anymore either.

127
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:26.379
And I won't spout nonsense like. "The
best belong in the Recon Corps."

128
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.680
I'm not as eager to die as some are.

129
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.150
You mean Eren?

130
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.519
He's already joined the Recon Corps.

131
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.949
Trainees. line up!

132
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.660
Line up in front of the stage!

133
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:39.989
Line up in front of the stage!

134
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:44.960
I'm not risking my life
because someone convinced me.

135
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.660
This is a job you can't do
unless you decide for yourself.

136
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:03.270
I am Erwin Smith. Commander
of the Recon Corps.

137
00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.859
Today. you will choose a
branch of the military.

138
00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:11.530
Putting it bluntly. I'm here to
persuade you to join the Recon Corps.

139
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.539
During their recent attack.

140
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.360
you learned how terrifying the Titans can be.

141
00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.339
as well as how limited your own strength is.

142
00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.120
However...

143
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.849
That battle brought mankind

144
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.680
closer to victory than ever before.

145
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.380
Eren Jaeger's existence is crucial.

146
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.299
By risking his own life.

147
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.160
he's undoubtedly proven himself
a great ally to mankind.

148
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:46.259
With his help. not only did
we stop the Titans' advance.

149
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.360
but we've also obtained a key to
discovering their true nature.

150
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.609
We believe that the basement
of his old home in Shiganshina

151
00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.300
holds answers about the Titans
that even he doesn't know.

152
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.620
If we can reach that basement.

153
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:11.710
we will find clues to ending this
century of Titan domination.

154
00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.710
The basement?

155
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.139
We've already advanced that far?

156
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.100
If we learn what they are. we can end this!

157
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.909
<i>No matter how much he needs recruits.</i>

158
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.959
<i>I can't believe he's
publicizing this information.</i>

159
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.389
<i>Or does he have some hidden motive?</i>

160
00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:35.550
<i>What is he trying to do?</i>

161
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.620
We will head for the
basement in Shiganshina.

162
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:48.599
However. that requires
us to retake Wall Maria.

163
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.690
In other words. our
objective remains the same.

164
00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:56.619
But with the Trost gate sealed for good.

165
00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.590
we'll have to take the long way
around from Karanes in the east.

166
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.179
The four years we spent laying a route

167
00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.240
for a full-scale
army have gone to waste.

168
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:12.280
In those four years. more than sixty
percent of the Recon Corps lost their lives.

169
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.840
Sixty percent in four years...

170
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.820
An insane figure.

171
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.890
Any trainees who join us will participate
in our excursion beyond the walls next month.

172
00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.560
We expect thirty percent won't return.

173
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.949
In four years. most will be dead.

174
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.849
But those who make it through

175
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.990
will become superior soldiers
with a high survival rate.

176
00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.580
Now you know the discouraging facts.

177
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.580
Any of you still willing to
risk your lives. remain here.

178
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.589
Ask yourselves:

179
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:57.300
Are you willing to offer your
beating hearts for mankind?

180
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:03.700
That is all.

181
00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.850
Anyone who wishes to join
another branch is dismissed.

182
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.230
Commander...

183
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.230
Don't you think you scared them a little much?

184
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.490
All of them will leave!

185
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:41.880
<i>Damn it...</i>

186
00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.060
<i>Come on. you've already made your choice!</i>

187
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.060
<i>Don't give me more reasons to hate myself...</i>

188
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.070
<i>If I don't leave now. I'll
have to face them again.</i>

189
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:59.030
<i>I left the village to join
the Military Police...</i>

190
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.159
<i>My mom would be so happy.</i>

191
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.990
<i>If I join the Military Police. the whole
village would think better of me.</i>

192
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.960
<i>We all know...</i>

193
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.670
<i>We've already seen it...</i>

194
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.130
<i>How the Titans...</i>

195
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.630
<i>devour humans!</i>

196
00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:46.499
Are you all willing to die
if you're ordered to?

197
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.080
I don't want to die!

198
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.149
I see.

199
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.040
I like the looks on your faces.

200
00:13:54.980 --> 00:14:00.340
I hereby welcome all of
you to the Recon Corps!

201
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.119
This is a true salute!

202
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.890
Offer up your hearts!

203
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.340
Yes. sir!

204
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.260
Guys...

205
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:14.399
This is the pits.

206
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.980
The Recon Corps...

207
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.279
I'm scared!

208
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.759
I want to go home.

209
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.250
I don't even care.

210
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.990
If you were going to cry.
you should have left.

211
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.259
You've done well to endure your fear.

212
00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.500
You are brave soldiers.

213
00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.290
You have my heartfelt respect.

214
00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.580
Salute!

215
00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.100
I'm Squad Leader Ness.

216
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.709
And this is Shallot. my horse.

217
00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.529
She loves to chew on people's hair.

218
00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:58.679
so be careful or you'll
wind up prematurely bald.

219
00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.979
Nice to meet you all!

220
00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:03.279
Hey! S-Stop it. Shallot!

221
00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.659
Someone grab her!

222
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.280
Our training began the next day.

223
00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:11.559
Instead of practical training.
it was mostly memorizing the

224
00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:15.290
long-range scouting formation
Commander Erwin had devised.

225
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.849
Strangely.

226
00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.129
although the formation was
written out in precise detail.

227
00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:24.819
Eren Jaeger's position
was nowhere to be found.

228
00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.979
You new recruits will be here.

229
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.539
in between the recon support team

230
00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.260
and the supply wagon escort team.

231
00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.770
Your jobs will be to ride alongside the
spare horses and relay messages.

232
00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:38.020
The Special Operations Squad will be here.

233
00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:40.589
standing by in the center of the last ranks.

234
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:42.280
We're pretty far back.

235
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.679
It's the safest place in the formation.

236
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.389
We're even more heavily guarded
than the supply wagons.

237
00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:53.139
Our goal this time is just
to sortie and return safely.

238
00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.790
This expedition is so brief

239
00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:00.020
because it's a practice run for
your journey to Shiganshina.

240
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.099
Um...

241
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:07.219
I still don't know what this
power should be used for...

242
00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:11.430
Did you understand what the
Commander's question meant?

243
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:14.180
<i>Where do you think the enemy is?</i>

244
00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.199
Did you all understand?

245
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.350
Nope.

246
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.699
It would be an overstatement
to say I understand it all.

247
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:23.430
But I think...

248
00:16:23.431 --> 00:16:27.649
It's possible this mission has another goal.

249
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:32.449
but the Commander has decided it'd be
best not to reveal that objective.

250
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:36.790
So we should just focus on
getting there and back.

251
00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.179
Just believe in the Commander.

252
00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.100
Right...

253
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.479
That's all the training for today.

254
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.820
Prepare to return to base.

255
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.869
Th-That's...

256
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:04.149
Sir. may I go talk with my classmates?

257
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.259
Go right ahead.

258
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
Hey. Mikasa! Armin!

259
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.280
Eren!

260
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.149
It feels like it's been forever!

261
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.599
Eren. did they do anything bad to you?

262
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.789
Did they examine you all over?

263
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.579
Did they psychologically torture you?

264
00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.879
Nothing like that.

265
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.299
That midget bastard crossed the line.

266
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.359
Someday. I'll make him pay for it.

267
00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.840
You don't mean Captain Levi. do you?

268
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:33.049
Yo. Eren...

269
00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:34.100
It's been so long!

270
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.550
What? Everyone's here?

271
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:42.439
But if you're all here. then...

272
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.479
Doesn't that mean all of you
joined the Recon Corps?

273
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.059
Why else would we be here?

274
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:52.130
So only Jean. Annie. and Marco
joined the Military Police?

275
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.339
No way. Not you too!

276
00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.000
Marco's dead.

277
00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:03.470
What was that?

278
00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.250
Did you say Marco's dead?

279
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.339
Not everyone goes out in a blaze of glory.

280
00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.760
I don't even know how it happened.

281
00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:20.399
He died without anyone around.

282
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.710
Marco...

283
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.270
Hey. newbies! Get over here!

284
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.820
Your uniforms are here!

285
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.939
Are you really...

286
00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:14.819
Yes. we'll all be participating
in the mission too.

287
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.099
Hey. Eren.

288
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:20.489
I heard that when you turned into a
Titan. you tried to kill Mikasa.

289
00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:21.950
What does that mean?

290
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:25.379
No. Eren was trying to hit a fly...

291
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.040
I wasn't asking you.

292
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:32.330
Mikasa. that wound on your
cheek looks pretty bad.

293
00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.670
When did you get that?

294
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.519
I'm told it's true...

295
00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.659
When I became a Titan. I tried to kill Mikasa.

296
00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.819
So then you don't remember it. right?

297
00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:49.440
In other words. you didn't even
know you had this Titan power.

298
00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:53.239
and you still don't have
the means to control it.

299
00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.190
Yeah. that's right.

300
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.859
Did you all hear that?

301
00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.959
That's the situation.

302
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.620
Mankind's existence. and
our lives. depend on him.

303
00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.299
We'll probably die just like Marco.

304
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.630
without Eren even noticing.

305
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.880
Jean. what's the point in asking
Eren these questions now?

306
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.959
Listen. Mikasa.

307
00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.619
Not everyone's like you.

308
00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.310
willing to die for Eren's
sake and nothing more.

309
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:30.719
We deserve to know what we're dying for.

310
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.820
Otherwise. we'll hesitate when the time comes.

311
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.610
We want something in return from him.

312
00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.820
Let's see what he has to offer us.

313
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.690
And whether it's worth our lives.

314
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.500
So. Eren...

315
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:56.760
We're <i>really</i> counting on you.

316
00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.770
Yeah.

317
00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:08.270
Sir. it's almost time.

318
00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.770
We've driven all the Titans out of the area.

319
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.190
Thirty seconds until we open the gate!

320
00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:23.909
It's the Recon Corps!

321
00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:27.370
They call that emblem on their
backs the Wings of Freedom!

322
00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.060
So cool...

323
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.000
It's time!

324
00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.880
Humanity will take another step forward.
