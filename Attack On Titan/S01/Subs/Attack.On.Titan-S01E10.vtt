1
00:00:01.878 --> 00:00:04.255
In the year 845.

2
00:00:04.464 --> 00:00:10.053
the Colossal Titan and the
Armored Titan suddenly appeared

3
00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:14.641
and destroyed one of humanity's
walls-and everyday life with it.

4
00:00:16.976 --> 00:00:20.021
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria.

5
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.775
lost 20% of its population
and one-third of its territory.

6
00:00:23.983 --> 00:00:28.780
and was forced to
retreat behind Wall Rose.

7
00:00:30.573 --> 00:00:34.786
Then. in the year 850. in Trost District...

8
00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:39.708
Once again. humanity allowed the
Titans to further their advance.

9
00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:43.920
And Eren Jaeger.
who had fallen prey to one.

10
00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.925
reappeared from inside
a mysterious Titan...

11
00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:10.155
<i>Unknown are the names
of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

12
00:01:10.363 --> 00:01:15.618
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth
and long for the wind</i>

13
00:01:15.827 --> 00:01:20.707
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

14
00:01:20.915 --> 00:01:26.045
<i>Only the will to fight
can change the here and now!</i>

15
00:01:26.254 --> 00:01:31.342
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve
to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

16
00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:33.887
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

17
00:01:34.095 --> 00:01:36.765
<i>Give us the freedom of dying.
starving wolves!</i>

18
00:01:36.973 --> 00:01:42.145
<i>The humiliation of being caged
is what triggers us to fight back</i>

19
00:01:42.353 --> 00:01:47.442
<i>We hunters slaughter prey
beyond the castle walls.</i>

20
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.655
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust.</i>

21
00:01:52.864 --> 00:01:59.788
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows
pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

22
00:02:27.398 --> 00:02:29.025
I'll ask one more time!

23
00:02:29.234 --> 00:02:31.903
What are you really?!

24
00:02:32.111 --> 00:02:33.530
I'm human!

25
00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.577
I see...

26
00:02:40.537 --> 00:02:43.248
Don't take this personally.

27
00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:49.003
Marco...

28
00:02:49.212 --> 00:02:51.297
I can't do this anymore...

29
00:02:51.506 --> 00:02:53.800
I can't fight Titans anymore!

30
00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:55.260
What's gotten into you?!

31
00:02:55.468 --> 00:02:57.303
My friends got
eaten right in front of me!

32
00:02:57.512 --> 00:03:02.475
My friends got killed. yet I didn't
feel any sadness or hate at all!

33
00:03:02.684 --> 00:03:07.063
Deep down.
I just felt glad it wasn't me...!

34
00:03:07.272 --> 00:03:09.816
But it's my turn next.

35
00:03:10.024 --> 00:03:12.652
I've realized what our job is...

36
00:03:12.861 --> 00:03:17.365
It's basically fighting and fighting
until we eventually get eaten!

37
00:03:17.574 --> 00:03:20.034
Well. screw that! I'd rather end things now...!

38
00:03:20.243 --> 00:03:22.495
Stop! Pull yourself together!

39
00:03:22.704 --> 00:03:24.122
You aren't the only one. you know!

40
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.875
We're all fighting back fear!

41
00:03:27.083 --> 00:03:28.209
Just look at Sasha!

42
00:03:28.418 --> 00:03:32.839
Even after what she went through.
she's still an upstanding soldier!

43
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:36.676
Umm... My stomach hurts...

44
00:03:36.885 --> 00:03:39.345
Could you please consider
me one of the wounded?

45
00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:42.891
- I can't go on!
- Stop!

46
00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.517
Stop it!

47
00:03:45.435 --> 00:03:48.605
That gag order is
definitely warranted.

48
00:03:48.813 --> 00:03:51.441
The situation's bad enough as it is.

49
00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:53.943
If they found out about Eren...

50
00:04:01.075 --> 00:04:02.327
Cannon fire?!

51
00:04:02.535 --> 00:04:03.870
Why only one shot?!

52
00:04:04.078 --> 00:04:05.872
Look! Smoke!

53
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.457
It's <i>inside</i> the wall!

54
00:04:07.665 --> 00:04:10.627
- Hey!
- What's happening?!

55
00:04:10.835 --> 00:04:12.003
What's going on?!

56
00:04:12.211 --> 00:04:14.297
Did they break through the water gate?!

57
00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:16.716
Impossible!
That's the sturdiest place of all!

58
00:04:16.925 --> 00:04:19.010
They must've just
set off a shell by accident!

59
00:04:19.218 --> 00:04:20.386
Still...

60
00:04:20.595 --> 00:04:23.181
Why's there so much smoke?!

61
00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.518
No way... Is it Titan steam?!

62
00:04:27.727 --> 00:04:29.145
Hey!

63
00:04:29.437 --> 00:04:30.939
H-Hey!

64
00:04:53.461 --> 00:04:56.631
What the hell...?!

65
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:18.945
It's alive!

66
00:05:19.153 --> 00:05:20.738
Captain Woermann!

67
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.745
W-Wait and see what it does!
We can't risk getting near it!

68
00:05:27.954 --> 00:05:31.249
Stay on alert. everyone!
Remain on standby!

69
00:05:31.457 --> 00:05:34.919
Artillerymen. reload the cannon!

70
00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:08.286
What is <i>this</i>...?

71
00:06:10.204 --> 00:06:13.750
I-I remember hearing the cannon go off...

72
00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:17.462
After that came a tremendous
sound. shock. and heat!

73
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.256
And now we're inside a giant skeleton...

74
00:06:20.465 --> 00:06:22.884
Eren protected us.

75
00:06:23.092 --> 00:06:25.845
That's all we need to understand for now.

76
00:06:29.265 --> 00:06:32.727
Flowers. only on the inside...?

77
00:06:32.935 --> 00:06:34.353
Hey!

78
00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:37.315
You guys okay?!

79
00:06:37.523 --> 00:06:39.275
Eren! What is this?!

80
00:06:39.484 --> 00:06:40.443
I don't know!

81
00:06:40.651 --> 00:06:44.447
But it's already starting to vaporize.
just like a Titan's corpse!

82
00:06:44.655 --> 00:06:46.741
Let's get away from it!

83
00:06:47.533 --> 00:06:50.661
Can't tell if they're watching
and waiting or if they're in a daze...

84
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.582
The Garrison Regiment isn't
showing any signs of activity for now...

85
00:06:55.792 --> 00:07:00.088
...but I'm sure they'll start
attacking again soon enough.

86
00:07:00.922 --> 00:07:05.009
I doubt there's any chance of reasoning
with them now. after seeing this.

87
00:07:05.218 --> 00:07:08.387
But there is one
thing I remember now.

88
00:07:08.596 --> 00:07:09.806
The basement.

89
00:07:10.014 --> 00:07:11.641
The basement of my house!

90
00:07:12.183 --> 00:07:15.853
My dad said it'd all
make sense if I go there!

91
00:07:16.062 --> 00:07:19.148
He's also the reason
this has happened to me...

92
00:07:19.357 --> 00:07:25.613
If I go to the basement. I might
figure out what the Titans are too!

93
00:07:28.533 --> 00:07:30.034
Damn it!

94
00:07:30.243 --> 00:07:32.328
Then why did he keep it a secret?!

95
00:07:32.537 --> 00:07:37.458
Thousands of Scouts have
died trying to get that information!

96
00:07:37.667 --> 00:07:40.711
It's the only hope humanity has!

97
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.633
And he just kept it tucked away
in our basement all this time?!

98
00:07:45.842 --> 00:07:48.845
What the hell was he thinking?!

99
00:07:51.055 --> 00:07:54.308
And where the hell has
he been these last five years...

100
00:07:54.517 --> 00:07:56.102
Eren.

101
00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.980
We have other things to attend to right now.

102
00:07:59.856 --> 00:08:01.274
Yeah...

103
00:08:02.066 --> 00:08:03.067
The smoke's clearing!

104
00:08:03.276 --> 00:08:04.152
Attack on sight!

105
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.236
Let's finish it off quick!

106
00:08:05.444 --> 00:08:07.280
Hold your positions!

107
00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:22.170
I'm getting out of here.

108
00:08:22.378 --> 00:08:25.590
- And going where? How?!
- Anywhere will do for now.

109
00:08:25.798 --> 00:08:28.759
Then I'll go over the wall and
make for the basement.

110
00:08:28.968 --> 00:08:30.970
After I've changed into a Titan again.

111
00:08:31.179 --> 00:08:33.431
Can you really do that?

112
00:08:33.639 --> 00:08:36.684
I don't know how I'm doing it. either.

113
00:08:36.893 --> 00:08:39.145
But I know I can do it!

114
00:08:39.353 --> 00:08:44.066
It's just like how I can't really
explain how I'm moving my arm.

115
00:08:45.109 --> 00:08:49.155
Just now. my mind unconsciously
focused on stopping the cannonball.

116
00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:53.743
That's why it decayed; it only had
the capabilities and endurance for that.

117
00:08:57.496 --> 00:08:59.832
Next time I'm gonna
be an even stronger one...

118
00:09:00.041 --> 00:09:03.836
I'm gonna be a 15 meter-high one
that can slaughter other Titans. like before!

119
00:09:04.045 --> 00:09:05.463
Eren!

120
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.798
Your nose is bleeding...

121
00:09:09.842 --> 00:09:12.720
You look really pale.
and your breathing is rough.

122
00:09:12.929 --> 00:09:16.307
Somethings clearly wrong!
You're not well!

123
00:09:16.515 --> 00:09:19.936
My health doesn't matter right now!

124
00:09:20.144 --> 00:09:22.230
I have two ideas in mind.

125
00:09:22.438 --> 00:09:27.568
You guys can get through this
alive if you stop trying to protect me.

126
00:09:28.527 --> 00:09:31.322
I've already caused
you enough trouble as it is.

127
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.492
so I'm gonna go
it alone from here on out.

128
00:09:35.243 --> 00:09:36.577
You can't be serious...

129
00:09:36.786 --> 00:09:38.412
...Eren.

130
00:09:39.205 --> 00:09:39.997
I'm coming with you.

131
00:09:40.206 --> 00:09:41.374
No!

132
00:09:41.582 --> 00:09:44.669
If I don't keep up.
you won't have to worry about me.

133
00:09:44.877 --> 00:09:47.797
But I won't have to
do what you say. either.

134
00:09:48.005 --> 00:09:50.424
I'm serious here!
Just forget about it!

135
00:09:50.633 --> 00:09:53.886
I'm not your little brother or your kid!

136
00:10:03.854 --> 00:10:06.023
What the hell?!

137
00:10:06.232 --> 00:10:10.069
Sir. The cannon is almost reloaded.

138
00:10:10.278 --> 00:10:13.614
What are your next attack orders?

139
00:10:14.323 --> 00:10:16.993
You will wait for my signal!

140
00:10:17.201 --> 00:10:18.911
Yes. Sir!

141
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.081
For now. the Garrison Regiment
isn't showing any signs

142
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.333
of launching a close-quarters assault.

143
00:10:24.542 --> 00:10:29.630
If they were. Mikasa would've
sensed it faster than a stray cat.

144
00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:32.800
Assuming they reload in
the shortest time possible...

145
00:10:33.009 --> 00:10:35.469
...it'll take them about twenty more seconds.

146
00:10:35.678 --> 00:10:40.433
I figure Eren will spring into
action and be gone before then...

147
00:10:44.061 --> 00:10:48.858
Why am I reminded
of that at a time like this?

148
00:10:49.066 --> 00:10:53.362
Is it... because
this is the end for us?

149
00:10:54.488 --> 00:10:57.283
In the very end.

150
00:10:57.491 --> 00:11:02.079
I never amounted to
anything more than a coward...

151
00:11:03.581 --> 00:11:06.542
They were there to
help me so many times...

152
00:11:06.751 --> 00:11:11.839
...but not once did
lever manage to help them.

153
00:11:15.259 --> 00:11:19.722
How can I possibly
call myself an equal friend?

154
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:24.101
How can I possibly
offer to go with them?

155
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:28.147
I'm not even confident
I can keep up...

156
00:11:37.406 --> 00:11:40.326
I guess this is the last time...

157
00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.791
...the three of us will ever be together...

158
00:11:48.042 --> 00:11:48.834
Eren. I <i>am</i>...

159
00:11:49.043 --> 00:11:50.878
Wait. Mikasa!

160
00:11:51.087 --> 00:11:54.382
I said I had <i>two</i> ideas. remember?

161
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:58.594
Armin. I leave the decision to you.

162
00:11:59.428 --> 00:12:00.221
Huh?

163
00:12:00.429 --> 00:12:04.975
Even I know how unrealistic this plan is.

164
00:12:05.184 --> 00:12:07.978
The best option would
be to use this Titan ability

165
00:12:08.187 --> 00:12:12.108
in a systematic way.
under the military's direction.

166
00:12:13.234 --> 00:12:15.403
I know this sounds crazy.

167
00:12:15.611 --> 00:12:22.368
but if you think you can convince the
Garrison Regiment that I'm not a threat.

168
00:12:22.576 --> 00:12:25.454
I'll trust in you and go with that option.

169
00:12:25.663 --> 00:12:28.374
That's my second idea.

170
00:12:28.582 --> 00:12:32.878
If you don't think you can do it.
I'll go with the other idea as a last resort.

171
00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.383
Decide in fifteen seconds.

172
00:12:37.591 --> 00:12:39.385
Can you do it or not?

173
00:12:39.593 --> 00:12:42.388
I'll respect your opinion.
whichever it is.

174
00:12:47.184 --> 00:12:48.769
Eren...

175
00:12:48.978 --> 00:12:52.565
Why are you entrusting such an
important decision to me?

176
00:12:52.773 --> 00:12:58.195
Even when things get ugly.
you always make the right call. y'know?

177
00:12:58.404 --> 00:13:01.532
I figure that's worth relying on.

178
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.409
When did I ever do that...?

179
00:13:03.617 --> 00:13:07.163
All the time.
Like that time five years ago...

180
00:13:07.371 --> 00:13:10.416
If you hadn't gone and
gotten Mr. Hannes for us.

181
00:13:10.624 --> 00:13:13.836
Mikasa and I would've been Titan food.

182
00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:27.016
It was all in my head... I convinced
myself that's how I was...

183
00:13:28.225 --> 00:13:33.564
I convinced myself
I was helpless and a burden...

184
00:13:36.233 --> 00:13:39.904
But they never felt that way at all...!

185
00:13:40.112 --> 00:13:42.823
Armin! We're out of time!

186
00:13:45.242 --> 00:13:47.203
They've finished reloading. Sir!

187
00:13:47.411 --> 00:13:49.246
We can fire at any time!

188
00:13:49.455 --> 00:13:52.917
These two who are willing
to place their lives in my hands...

189
00:13:53.125 --> 00:13:58.297
...are the people I trust
more than anyone in this world.

190
00:13:58.506 --> 00:14:03.052
What more convincing
do I need than that?!

191
00:14:06.138 --> 00:14:08.349
I <i>will</i> persuade them. without fail.

192
00:14:08.557 --> 00:14:12.811
I'll need you to act as
nonaggressive as possible.

193
00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:23.989
Something's been bugging me ever
since Eren started fighting as a Titan.

194
00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:26.784
I haven't collected my
thoughts yet. but I'll do this!

195
00:14:26.992 --> 00:14:29.870
I'll have to think as I talk!

196
00:14:33.916 --> 00:14:35.334
Halt!

197
00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:42.675
You've finally revealed your true form. monster!

198
00:14:42.883 --> 00:14:46.011
I'll do it! I'll give the signal to fire!

199
00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.514
He is not an enemy of humanity!

200
00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:53.018
We're willing to disclose
everything we've learned!

201
00:14:53.227 --> 00:14:55.271
Begging for your lives won't help you!

202
00:14:55.479 --> 00:14:59.149
He's revealed his true form for
all to see! What more is there to say?!

203
00:14:59.358 --> 00:15:02.069
If you insist he's not our enemy.
then show me proof!

204
00:15:02.278 --> 00:15:05.573
If you can't. then we'll simply
eliminate the threat he poses!

205
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:08.075
There's no need for proof!

206
00:15:08.284 --> 00:15:10.995
That's right... There is no need!

207
00:15:11.203 --> 00:15:15.416
In fact. this isn't about
what we perceive him to be!

208
00:15:15.624 --> 00:15:16.584
What?!

209
00:15:16.792 --> 00:15:19.587
I hear that countless people saw him!

210
00:15:19.795 --> 00:15:22.881
In which case. they surely
saw him fighting Titans as well!

211
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:27.011
And they must've seen the
Titans swarming around him too!

212
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:33.809
In other words. the Titans saw
him as prey-just like they see us!

213
00:15:34.018 --> 00:15:39.189
That's an irrefutable fact.
however hard you look at it!

214
00:15:42.985 --> 00:15:44.570
He has a point...

215
00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:47.990
- A Titan. on our side?
- That's crazy...!

216
00:15:56.624 --> 00:15:58.375
Prepare to attack!

217
00:15:58.584 --> 00:16:02.087
Don't be taken in
by their clever ruses!

218
00:16:03.464 --> 00:16:06.717
Their behavior has always
been beyond our understanding!

219
00:16:06.925 --> 00:16:11.513
It's entirely possible they'd take on
human form and use human language

220
00:16:11.722 --> 00:16:13.515
to deceive us all!

221
00:16:13.724 --> 00:16:17.061
We can't let them have their way anymore!

222
00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:22.274
It's no use...

223
00:16:22.483 --> 00:16:25.736
He's abandoned all logic...

224
00:16:25.944 --> 00:16:28.822
He's afraid to think...

225
00:16:29.823 --> 00:16:32.117
Eren! Mikasa!

226
00:16:41.794 --> 00:16:44.463
As a soldier. I have
long sworn to give my heart

227
00:16:44.672 --> 00:16:47.424
for the restoration of humankind!

228
00:16:47.633 --> 00:16:52.012
Nothing would make me
happier than to die for that cause!

229
00:16:52.221 --> 00:16:56.725
If we combine his Titan ability
with our own remaining manpower.

230
00:16:56.934 --> 00:17:00.062
we can retake this city!

231
00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.272
For humanity's glory.

232
00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:05.150
in what little time I have left to live.

233
00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:08.821
I will continue to
advocate his strategic value!

234
00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:14.410
Captain Woermann.

235
00:17:14.618 --> 00:17:16.161
I believe his words are worth consid-

236
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:17.871
Silence!

237
00:17:19.373 --> 00:17:22.835
However much they beg
for their lives. they're still traitors...

238
00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:25.212
To dispose of those who violate the rules...

239
00:17:25.421 --> 00:17:28.590
That is the duty of a soldier!

240
00:17:32.386 --> 00:17:33.887
That's enough.

241
00:17:35.347 --> 00:17:40.144
I see you're still as delicate
as a young deer despite your size.

242
00:17:41.603 --> 00:17:43.230
Commander Pyxis...!

243
00:17:45.232 --> 00:17:48.277
Can you not see that
soldier's splendid salute?

244
00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:55.909
I've only just arrived. but I've
been filled in on the situation.

245
00:17:56.118 --> 00:17:58.537
You're in charge of
the reinforcements now.

246
00:17:58.746 --> 00:18:03.792
Something tells me we ought
to hear these people out. you see...

247
00:18:10.174 --> 00:18:12.760
According to the
Scout Regiment's reports.

248
00:18:12.968 --> 00:18:16.221
it was believed that the
Titans would appear from the south.

249
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:20.851
Indeed. it was Shiganshina District.
on the south side of Wall Maria.

250
00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:23.854
that the Titans attacked.

251
00:18:24.062 --> 00:18:29.359
As a result. the fortified city of Trost
on the south side of Wall Rose

252
00:18:29.568 --> 00:18:34.072
was deemed their next most likely target.

253
00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:40.746
Dot Pyxis...

254
00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:46.502
The top officer in charge of Trost
and the entire southern territory.

255
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:51.131
and the man given full authority for the
defense of humanity's most vital region.

256
00:18:53.509 --> 00:18:56.261
Nope. none at all...

257
00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:00.432
I certainly wouldn't mind being
gobbled up by a beautiful girl Titan...

258
00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:06.021
And he's also known for
being a full-blown eccentric.

259
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:08.774
What is the commander thinking?!

260
00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:12.611
Taking those freaks up
there without a single bodyguard...!

261
00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:18.242
I don't know. He's never
been one to make much sense.

262
00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:19.868
Sir.

263
00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:22.538
We've finished reassembling the troops.

264
00:19:22.746 --> 00:19:23.705
Right.

265
00:19:23.914 --> 00:19:25.415
Good work.

266
00:19:30.379 --> 00:19:31.672
I see.

267
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.383
And visiting this basement will
make everything clear?

268
00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:37.678
Yes... Do you believe me?

269
00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:40.264
Seeing as you. yourself.
are unable to provide validation.

270
00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:44.560
for now I'm simply
keeping it all in mind.

271
00:19:44.768 --> 00:19:50.065
But I do believe I can tell when
someone is being sincere or not.

272
00:19:50.274 --> 00:19:54.111
I will personally guarantee your safety.

273
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:58.824
Cadet Arlelt. was it?

274
00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:00.075
Yes. Sir!

275
00:20:00.284 --> 00:20:03.662
Earlier. you mentioned that
with this so-called "Titan ability"

276
00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:07.165
it would be possible to retake this city.

277
00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:09.209
Do you truly believe that?

278
00:20:09.418 --> 00:20:13.297
Or was that just a
desperate plea for your life?

279
00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:14.923
Well...

280
00:20:15.966 --> 00:20:17.926
Both.

281
00:20:18.135 --> 00:20:23.974
I was going to suggest that Eren.
in Titan form. could take that giant rock

282
00:20:24.182 --> 00:20:27.853
and use it to block the wrecked entrance.

283
00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:31.607
It was just an idea
I came up with on the spot...

284
00:20:31.815 --> 00:20:34.860
I just wanted them to see
the possibilities of Eren's ability

285
00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:38.780
and how it could help
solve the situation we're in...

286
00:20:41.575 --> 00:20:44.786
Of course. I was
desperate to survive. too!

287
00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:48.540
"Desperate to survive..."

288
00:20:48.749 --> 00:20:51.960
There's nothing more
credible than those words.

289
00:21:00.218 --> 00:21:03.347
What do you say. Cadet Jaeger?

290
00:21:03.555 --> 00:21:04.932
Sir?

291
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.851
Can you plug the hole?

292
00:21:09.519 --> 00:21:12.898
Well... Uhh...

293
00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:14.441
I'm not sure.

294
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:20.197
Right now. I don't really understand
any more than the rest of you.

295
00:21:20.405 --> 00:21:23.158
Maybe I can. Maybe I can't. I don't know.

296
00:21:23.367 --> 00:21:26.453
I don't feel I can risk
giving an irresponsible answer...

297
00:21:26.662 --> 00:21:29.331
Ah. yes. My apologies.

298
00:21:29.539 --> 00:21:32.209
I asked the wrong question.

299
00:21:33.752 --> 00:21:37.673
<i>Will</i> you do it or not?

300
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.286
I'll do it.

301
00:22:09.496 --> 00:22:10.747
I'll do it!

302
00:22:10.956 --> 00:22:13.625
I don't know if
I can plug the hole or not.

303
00:22:13.834 --> 00:22:15.085
But...

304
00:22:15.293 --> 00:22:16.920
I'll do it!

305
00:22:37.399 --> 00:22:42.320
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

306
00:22:42.529 --> 00:22:48.577
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

307
00:22:48.785 --> 00:22:53.248
<i>Over and over you cast them aside.
only to find more</i>

308
00:22:53.457 --> 00:22:59.921
<i>Now. rest in peace</i>

309
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:11.266
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

310
00:23:11.475 --> 00:23:21.526
<i>and the more we forget
the more we remember again</i>

311
00:23:21.735 --> 00:23:27.491
<i>In this beautiful. cruel world</i>

312
00:23:27.699 --> 00:23:32.662
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

313
00:23:32.871 --> 00:23:38.376
<i>Oh. with our strength... and our weakness...</i>

314
00:23:38.585 --> 00:23:44.049
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

315
00:23:44.257 --> 00:23:47.677
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

316
