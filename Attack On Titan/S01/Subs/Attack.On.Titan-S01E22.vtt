﻿1
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.479
I was right!

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.440
It is coming!

3
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.570
The female-form Titan!

4
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.389
The female-form Titan emerged again.

5
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.660
defeating the members of the elite
Levi Squad one after another.

6
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.499
I'll kill you!

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.129
Blaming himself for having entrusted
the battle to his comrades.

8
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.840
Eren transformed and battled
the female-form Titan.

9
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.100
However. he is defeated and
captured by the female-form Titan.

10
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.370
Give Eren back!

11
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.049
No matter where she goes. I'll kill her.

12
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.339
rip her wide open.

13
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.800
and dig you out of that filth.

14
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.570
Just hang on a little longer.

15
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.358
Don't give up Eren.

16
00:01:18.542 --> 00:01:20.026
never give up!

17
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.849
Wait!

18
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.770
Wh-What are you...

19
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.780
Fall back for now.

21
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.460
The Defeated

22
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:14.960
57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (pt 6)

23
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.380
Maintain this distance.

24
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.799
She's probably tired.

25
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.260
The pace she's keeping
isn't particularly fast.

26
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.639
It seems like he was bitten
right out along with the neck.

27
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.060
Is Eren dead?

28
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.360
He's alive.

29
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.149
Our target seems highly intelligent.

30
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.149
and capturing Eren is
apparently her primary goal.

31
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.420
If she wanted him dead. she
could've crushed him in her jaws.

32
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.899
Instead. she's carefully
holding Eren inside her mouth

33
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.200
while fighting to escape.

34
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.849
Eating Eren may also have been her goal.

35
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.040
If so. he would've ended up in her stomach.

36
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.749
It makes more sense to assume he's dead.

37
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.050
He's alive!

38
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.300
I hope you're right.

39
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.390
If only you'd protected Eren.
this never would've happened!

40
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.329
Now I see...

41
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.950
It was you back then.

42
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.420
You're Eren's close friend.

43
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.539
We'll focus all our manpower on one goal.

44
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.619
First of all. forget about
killing the female-form Titan.

45
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.660
But she killed so many of our comrades!

46
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.809
So long as she can crystallize her
skin. there's no way we can kill her.

47
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.170
Trust my judgment.

48
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.489
We'll keep hoping that Eren is still alive.

49
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.999
and attempt to rescue him
before she leaves the forest.

50
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.799
I'll hack her up...

51
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.780
You draw her attention!

52
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:44.989
He's fast...

53
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.100
He moves so quickly that she can't
get a chance to harden her skin!

54
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.499
We can go for her neck!

55
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.969
She's tired...

56
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.510
I bet she can't move!

57
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:07.630
I can kill her!

58
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.310
Stop!

59
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.280
Eren!

60
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.040
Hey!

61
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.830
We need to get out of here!

62
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.980
Eren!

63
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.189
I think he's okay.

64
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.459
He's alive!

65
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.500
Filthy. though.

66
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.169
Don't worry about anything else.

67
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.510
We're pulling back.

68
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.709
Don't lose sight of your primary objective.

69
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.770
Is it more important to get
the revenge you desire?

70
00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.770
Isn't he a dear friend of yours?

71
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.270
No. I...

72
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.040
They're returning already?

73
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.639
What happened?

74
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.229
No clue.

75
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.970
I'll bet they're coming back with
a heap of corpses again. though.

76
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.110
Erd is coming home.

77
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.730
I see.

78
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.500
You think Auruo will have time to come home?

79
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:06.210
It couldn't hurt to make
dinner for him. just in case.

80
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.840
Günther's coming home.

81
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.640
I see.

82
00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.200
This is the part I just can't get used to.

83
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.000
Nobody gets used to it.

84
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.719
How are my friends going to die?

85
00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.890
How am I going to die?

86
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.920
It's all I can think about.

87
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.720
I try not to dwell on it.

88
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.739
If I imagined the way I'm going to die.

89
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.880
I doubt I'd be able to fight at all.

90
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.480
Yeah.

91
00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.420
You're right.

92
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.550
How much longer will I be alive?

93
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.490
You're living now. aren't you?

94
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.629
For the moment.

95
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.759
Isn't that a good thing?

96
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.330
You're alive!

97
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.420
How can you say that in front of
the corpses of those who died?

98
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.570
I'm not even sure I can go home anymore...

99
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.159
We're almost done.

100
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.950
There were five casualties
we couldn't recover.

101
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.549
Not even any parts of them?

102
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.790
We couldn't get close enough
because of the Titans.

103
00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:43.780
It's probably better for the families
if we don't bring those back.

104
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.049
Report them as missing.

105
00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:47.870
Yes. sir.

106
00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:53.069
We've sighted several Titans near the forest.

107
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.460
but none are headed in our direction us yet.

108
00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:57.090
We're moving out now.

109
00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.369
Inform the squads.

110
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.369
Yes. sir.

111
00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.099
I refuse to accept this. Commander Erwin!

112
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.809
Hey. you...

113
00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.749
We should recover them!

114
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.769
Ivan's body was right in front of us!

115
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.379
There was a Titan right next to him!

116
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.109
We'd just end up losing someone else!

117
00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:17.759
If they attack us. we can just take them out!

118
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.599
Ivan and I are childhood
friends from the same village!

119
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.279
I know his parents.

120
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.879
If nothing else. I'd at least
like to bring him home!

121
00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.209
Stop being selfish!

122
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:27.820
Quarreling children?

123
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.349
Captain Levi!

124
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.420
If you confirmed he's dead. that's enough.

125
00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.319
Whether or not you have a body. dead is dead.

126
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.300
It doesn't change a thing.

127
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.200
That's...

128
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.809
We'll say Ivan and the others are missing.

129
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.279
That's my final decision.

130
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.450
Leave it at that.

131
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.189
Don't either of you

132
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.869
possess any human feelings at all?!

133
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.360
Hey. Dieter! You're getting too far ahead!

134
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:44.960
Titans!

135
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:53.600
That's...

136
00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.850
Dieter!

137
00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.020
That fool...

138
00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.110
The rear guard has sighted Titans!

139
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.610
Full speed ahead!

140
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.719
I don't see any tall trees or buildings.

141
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.179
It will be difficult to fight out here.

142
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.450
We're better off trying
to outrun them to Walls.

143
00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.979
They're gonna catch us!

144
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.269
Will we have to fight?

145
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.199
3D Maneuver Gear has limited
functionality in open areas!

146
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.200
And look...

147
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.360
They just keep coming!

148
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.790
Then what'll we do?

149
00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.850
We...

150
00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.449
No! They'll catch us!

151
00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.209
I'll circle behind them!

152
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:43.869
When I draw their attention. you...

153
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:44.960
No.

154
00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.409
Just abandon the corpses.

155
00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:49.039
Otherwise they'll catch us.

156
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.010
B-But...

157
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:54.629
On past expeditions. dozens
of bodies never made it back.

158
00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:57.140
These guys will be no different.

159
00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.780
Are we doing this?

160
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.980
We're seriously dumping them?!

161
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.810
Damn it...

162
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.990
We have no choice!

163
00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.519
Okay!

164
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.850
Keep on going!

165
00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.549
As soon as we ascertain our
location. we'll depart.

166
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.030
Stay alert!

167
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.040
We'll have to take a slight
detour to the east...

168
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.050
Captain Levi...

169
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.310
I...

170
00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.020
This proves that they were alive.

171
00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.060
To me. at least.

172
00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:30.960
This was Ivan's.

173
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.320
Captain...

174
00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.030
We're leaving!

175
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.450
Eren. you should give up
on joining the Recon Corps.

176
00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:24.039
What? You're going to
tell me it's stupid too?

177
00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.790
That's not it...

178
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:35.839
The Recon Corps is back!

179
00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.659
The front gate's opening!

180
00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.719
Let's go. Mikasa!

181
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.840
The heroes have returned!

182
00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.799
Only this many made it back?

183
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.570
The rest of them must've been eaten.

184
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.829
That's what you get when you
venture outside the walls.

185
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:13.540
It's like all our taxes are
spent fattening up the Titans.

186
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:14.830
Eren?

187
00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.260
What is it?

188
00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:30.850
Eren...

189
00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:37.770
Eren!

190
00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.680
Eren...

191
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.950
Don't try to get up yet.

192
00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.140
Rest up.

193
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.590
The female-form Titan?

194
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:03.090
It escaped.

195
00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.489
Why?

196
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:08.250
What happened to others?

197
00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.600
What about the plan?

198
00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.850
It failed.

199
00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.020
Lay still for now.

200
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.860
What's going on?

201
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:23.110
Did you save me again?

202
00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:29.680
We're almost to the Walls.

203
00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.439
Aren't a bunch of them missing
compared to this morning?

204
00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.699
Man...

205
00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.550
Far fewer...

206
00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:56.190
How horrible.

207
00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:01.439
Just this morning they left to raise
hell. but now they're back already?

208
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.319
What was the point?

209
00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.700
Who knows?

210
00:20:04.726 --> 00:20:09.832
But judging by those gloomy expressions.
they managed to gobble up more of our taxes

211
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.210
Eren. just bear with it.

212
00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.639
So cool!

213
00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.349
The Recon Corps are so awesome!

214
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:37.720
They get their butts kicked.
but they keep on fighting!

215
00:20:57.479 --> 00:20:59.345
Captain Levi!

216
00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:01.750
My daughter is in your squad.

217
00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:03.629
I'm Petra's father.

218
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.770
Before I see her. I wanted to talk with you.

219
00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.499
She sent me this letter.

220
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:14.359
She said you respected her skills
enough to allow her join your squad.

221
00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.389
She swore she'd to devote herself to you.

222
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:22.380
Well. I guess she's too starry-eyed
to consider her father's feelings!

223
00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:27.490
Anyway. as her father.

224
00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.349
I think it's still too early for her to marry.

225
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:35.239
She's still so young. with
so much left to experience!

226
00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.359
Commander Erwin! Answer us!

227
00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:42.249
Did your expedition learn anything
worthwhile to can justify the body count?

228
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:45.870
Do you really believe the
dead leave no regrets?

229
00:21:47.168 --> 00:21:52.916
The costs and casualties of the
failed expedition were easily enough

230
00:21:53.158 --> 00:21:58.351
to discredit the faction that
had supported the Recon Corps.

231
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:14.691
As those responsible. including
Erwin. were summoned to the capitol.

232
00:22:15.072 --> 00:22:19.193
it was decided that Eren would be handed over.

9999
00:00:0.500 --> 00:00:2.00
