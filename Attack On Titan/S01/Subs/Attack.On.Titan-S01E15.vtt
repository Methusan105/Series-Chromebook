You cowards.

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.320
Just shut up and let me shoulder it all!

3
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.619
You don't need to be educated by words.

4
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.120
You need training.

5
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.120
I've made my decision.

6
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.629
Eren was put under the
care of the Recon Corps.

7
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.420
He was to dedicate himself to
missions outside the Wall.

14
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.280
The Special Ops Squad - Prelude
to the Counterattack (pt 2)

15
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.560
Trost

16
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.059
Former Recon Corps HQ

17
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.790
The former Recon Corps headquarters.

18
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.489
It's nothing more than a renovated old castle.

19
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.220
While it definitely looks impressive.

20
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.319
it's so far from the Walls and all rivers

21
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.180
that it's completely useless
to the Recon Corps.

22
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.859
The story goes back to the ambitious
early days when the Corps was formed.

23
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.360
Who would've thought we'd end up using
it again to serve as your hideout?

24
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.089
Don't get cocky. new blood.

25
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.780
What?

26
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.649
I don't know the deal with this
crap about you being a Titan.

27
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.500
but we can't have Captain Levi babysit...

28
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.449
That's what you get for talking
while riding your horse.

29
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.319
The first moments leave the
most important impression.

30
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.709
That newbie was scared shitless.

31
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.319
I think he was just stunned
silent by how lame you are.

32
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.279
Still. it's all going according to plan.

33
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.940
Man. you never used to talk like that.

34
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.229
If. by chance. you're trying
to imitate Captain Levi.

35
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.239
you should really stop it.

36
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.450
You two are nothing alike. but still...

37
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.439
Do you want to chain me down. Petra?

38
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.460
You're still ways to go to
be fitting for my wife.

39
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.859
If only you'd bled to death
from biting your tongue.

40
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.759
You keep on boasting about how
many Titans you've killed too.

41
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.010
So what? I've boasted about you guys too.

42
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.239
<i>Those people are the Recon
Corps' Special Ops Squad.</i>

43
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.679
<i>commonly known as the Levi Unit.</i>

44
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.399
You're pathetic!

45
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.840
<i>Petra Ral. Took down 10 Titans.
Assisted with taking down another 46.</i>

46
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.490
<i>Auruo Bossard. Took down 39.
Assisted with another 9.</i>

47
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.230
<i>They are the elite of the elite.</i>

48
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.069
<i>Erd Gin. Took down 14.
Assisted with another 32.</i>

49
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.510
<i>Günther Schultz. Took down 7.
Assisted with another 40.</i>

50
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.859
<i>They are the top tier of the Recon
Corps. hand-picked by Captain Levi.</i>

51
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.710
<i>If I went berserk. these people
would be the ones to kill me.</i>

52
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.480
It's covered in weeds.

53
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.679
It looks terrible.

54
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.159
It's been disused for a very long time.

55
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.319
Inside. a sea of dust is probably awaiting us.

56
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.370
That is indeed a severe problem.

57
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.320
We must sort it out immediately.

58
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.800
We're done cleaning the upper floors.

59
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.930
Where will I get to sleep
in the building. sir?

60
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.430
Your room is in the basement.

61
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.199
The basement again. sir?

62
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.640
Of course. You're not in complete
control of yourself yet.

63
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.379
If you drifted off and turned into a Titan.

64
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.480
at least if you're underground
we can restrain you right away.

65
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.919
That was one of the conditions agreed
upon for us to get custody of you.

66
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.490
It's a rule that we must follow.

67
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.819
I'll take a look around the rooms.

68
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.149
You do this room. Eren.

69
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.000
Yes. sir.

70
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.959
You've got quite a despairing
look on your face. Eren.

71
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.139
I do?

72
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.589
Ah. I'll be calling you Eren.

73
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.739
Captain Levi does the same.

74
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.760
Here. his word is the law.

75
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.249
Right... I don't mind that.

76
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.189
but did I really have a
despairing look on my face?

77
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.020
It's not surprising at all.

78
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.659
He doesn't come across as the perfect.
invulnerable hero people think he is. does he?

79
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.209
The true Levi is surprisingly short.

80
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.960
irritable. violent. and hard to approach.

81
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:39.359
That's not it. I was surprised how obediently
he accepts the decisions of the higher-ups.

82
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.476
Did you think that.
as strong as he is.

83
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:44.279
he wouldn't care about rank
or the chain of command?

84
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.550
Yes.

85
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.289
I expected him not to
acquiesce to anyone's words.

86
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.560
I don't know the details myself. but I heard
he was pretty much like that originally.

87
00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:01.970
Before joining the Recon Corps. he was a
famous thug in the capital's underworld.

88
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.569
But then. why?

89
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.439
I don't know exactly what happened.

90
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.470
He was taken in to the Recon Corps
under Commander Erwin's hands.

91
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:16.750
The Commander?

92
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.829
Hey. Eren!

93
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.869
Yes. sir?

94
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.590
It's no good at all. Redo it all from scratch.

95
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:27.935
So. in thirty days.

96
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.974
we're to go outside the Walls to build
a stronghold for the supply chain?

97
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.950
Not to mention we'll be taking
fresh graduates with us too.

98
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.850
If we even get any new recruits that is.

99
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.310
In my opinion. this is far too hasty.

100
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.659
Eren's current position is a temporary thing.

101
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:53.240
We must quickly and smoothly
prove his usefulness to Central.

102
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.979
Otherwise. sooner or later. the
Police will make another move to...

103
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.910
Can't you take that mask off
at least for me. Erwin?

104
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.420
You're really good at sniffing
out things like this. Mike.

105
00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.340
Too bad you have no scent whatsoever.

106
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.570
I'll tell you when the time is right.

107
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.399
We'll probably be ordered to
stand by for a few more days.

108
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.739
but I heard we're supposed to be going
on a large-scale extramural expedition.

109
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.989
And we'll be taking the new
graduates with us as well.

110
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.179
Is this true. Erd?

111
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.950
Isn't it awfully soon?

112
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:46.250
Even considering that they handled
this last Titan attack quite well...

113
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.019
I heard those kids' pants required multiple
washings to remove the shitstains.

114
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.419
Is this all true. Captain?

115
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.089
I'm not involved in making our plans.

116
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:59.929
It's Erwin. He's likely considering far
more variables that might occur to us.

117
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:04.319
It's true that we're in an
unprecedented situation.

118
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.670
On the one hand. we lost
the Maria reconquest route

119
00:08:07.695 --> 00:08:10.569
that we established
through huge sacrifices.

120
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.650
but on the other hand. we got
an unexpected ray of hope.

121
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.889
I still have trouble believing it.

122
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:28.670
You can "turn into a Titan".
but what's that mean. Eren?

123
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.309
My memories from that time are quite hazy.

124
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:35.819
It felt like a selfless. dreaming state.

125
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.209
It can be triggered by hurting myself.

126
00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:40.550
Like. if I bite...

127
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.660
<i>Wait. how do I know this?</i>

128
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.889
You guys know all of this too.

129
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.749
We couldn't get any more out of him
than what's written in the reports.

130
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.810
She won't stay put though.

131
00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.109
Her meddling could even kill you. Eren.

132
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.020
She? Who?

133
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:12.380
Good evening. gentlemen of the Levi Unit!

134
00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.259
Have you made yourselves
at home in the castle?

135
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.599
You're early.

136
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.879
How could I stay put now?

137
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.959
Major Hanji?

138
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.639
Sorry for the wait. Eren.

139
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:28.339
I'm charged with experimenting on the
two Titans we caught alive in the city.

140
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.399
I want you to help me out
with tomorrow's experiments.

141
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.609
I came to ask permission for that.

142
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.900
An experiment?

143
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:37.479
What am I supposed to...

144
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:42.030
What else but that totally
awesome thing you do!

145
00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:46.580
Uh... I can't give you permission myself.

146
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.409
I don't have authority over myself. you see.

147
00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.710
Levi. what are Eren's plans for tomorrow?

148
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.589
Cleaning the garden.

149
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.090
Okay then. it's decided!

150
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.220
I'll be counting on you tomorrow. Eren!

151
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.430
Yes. ma'am.

152
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.349
But what exactly are these
experiments on the Titans?

153
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.600
Hm?

154
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.230
Uh... What exactly are these experiments...

155
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.150
Stop that. Don't ask her.

156
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.429
Ah. I knew it.

157
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.530
You just had this expression
like you wanted to know.

158
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.239
Were you <i>that</i> interested?

159
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.880
Then I've got no choice.

160
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.840
I guess I've gotta tell you

161
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.760
what I know about those
pretties we caught earlier.

162
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.310
First. we repeated the experiments
we'd done each of the five

163
00:10:48.335 --> 00:10:50.514
prior times we had
Titans to play with.

164
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:53.950
Hello.

165
00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.310
First. we attempted communication.

166
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.089
How are you feeling? What's your name?

167
00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:05.380
Does it hurt anywhere?

168
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.120
Major. you're too close!

169
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:11.590
Hello.

170
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:13.859
Isn't the weather wonderful today?

171
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.640
Are you hungry?

172
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.899
Whoa!

173
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:18.750
Whoa-whoa. that was close!

174
00:11:18.751 --> 00:11:20.799
Major. it's too dangerous!

175
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:27.010
Sadly. communication proved
impossible this time as well.

176
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:34.639
But for me. interacting with
the Titans was so enlightening

177
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.620
that it made me entirely
forget my everyday fatigue.

178
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:42.910
A long. long time ago. there
was a tribe who ate people.

179
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:49.059
They weren't Titans like you.
They were humans.

180
00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.470
They hid out in caves in the mountains.

181
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.759
attacked travelers who happened
to tread the roads nearby.

182
00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.839
robbed them of their valuables.

183
00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.059
killed them.

184
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.200
and ate their flesh.

185
00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:04.339
She's started another one
of her naming ceremonies.

186
00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:07.019
What did we end up with last time?

187
00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.979
Chicacchironi and Albert.

188
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:14.759
They kept up their resistance for 25 years.

189
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:20.029
During that time. over 500
people became their prey.

190
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:24.050
That might be more than
the humans you guys ate.

191
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.790
They also experimented with various
ways of preparing their meals.

192
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.250
Turning the buttocks into steaks.

193
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.189
Cutting the thighs up into cubes
and cooking a stew with them.

194
00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.989
They minced. kneaded. and fried the hard meat.

195
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:42.390
Out of fat and innards.
they even made sausages.

196
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.640
That's right. They knew
the concept of "cooking".

197
00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.650
That's how they were different from you.

198
00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:56.650
But then those cannibals made a mistake.
and they were all caught and executed.

199
00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.669
That's the same as you.

200
00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:03.359
You made the mistake of attacking mankind.

201
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.050
and you were caught.

202
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:12.600
So I'll name you after the
man who led that clan.

203
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:14.820
You're Sawney.

204
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.060
You're Bean.

205
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:23.390
But don't worry. I won't have you executed.

206
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.310
Nice to meet you. Sawney.

207
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.230
You too. Bean.

208
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.440
Let's try to get along.

209
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:38.480
Thus I named the 7 meter class Bean.
and the 4 meter class Sawney.

210
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:47.139
Next we tried denying them sunlight.

211
00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:50.459
The Titans are clearly less
active during the night.

212
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:55.460
These experiments tried to prove that they
gain some kind of power from the sunlight.

213
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:59.660
There was a huge variation
between individual Titans.

214
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.220
You've worked hard. Sawney.

215
00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.770
Good night. See you tomorrow.

216
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:13.079
Sawney's activity dropped an hour after
we denied them sunlight. In contrast...

217
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.289
You really like to stay up late. huh. Bean?

218
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.740
It's okay. I'll stay here with you.

219
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.680
Bean stayed lively for three hours.

220
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.250
They always manage to surprise me.

221
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.189
They don't need water or food.

222
00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:36.819
They have vocal organs. yet
they don't need to breathe.

223
00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.260
All they need to stay alive is sunlight.

224
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.539
{an8}To be honest. I'm curious what would
happen if we denied them sunlight completely.

225
00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:47.140
but they're such valuable experimental
subjects. I can't risk them dying.

226
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.380
We killed the previous
captures by accident.

227
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.150
I accidentally hit the nape of the
neck when we tried cutting their heads off.

228
00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:00.190
Their names were
Chicacchironi and Albert.

229
00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.140
They had such beautiful smiles.

230
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.180
I feel bad about what I did to them.

231
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.470
I don't want that to
happen again... I'm sorry.

232
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.340
Major Hanji...

233
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.749
And then.

234
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:26.180
I moved on to the next stage. testing their
sense of pain by actually touching them!

235
00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.039
Major. you shouldn't be the one screaming...

236
00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.560
How could I not scream. doing this?!

237
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.230
Bean is in so much pain!

238
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:45.450
Don't give up. Bean! Hang in there!

239
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:51.660
We had to confirm whether they had any
weaknesses besides the nape of the neck.

240
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:54.680
It was really tough work.

241
00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:03.279
Sawney? I just pierced your heart.
Doesn't it hurt?

242
00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.380
How does it feel?

243
00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.890
Compared to Bean. Sawney was a lot quieter.

244
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.860
He hardly reacted at all.

245
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:16.060
Hm? What was that?

246
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:20.879
Major. fall back!

247
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.869
Haha. that was really close!

248
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.740
You're gonna end up actually dying!

249
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.579
Sawney isn't very good at expressing himself.

250
00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.109
He just keeps trying to bite my head off.

251
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.080
Um. Major Hanji...

252
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:43.380
How can you stay so carefree
in front of the Titans?

253
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:51.600
They're our natural enemies. who
drove us to the brink of extinction.

254
00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:56.550
I'm sure you've had to face their threat
a number of times before yourself too.

255
00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.299
That's right.

256
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.610
I've had countless comrades murdered
by them right in front of my eyes.

257
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:09.770
Back when I joined the Recon Corps.
I fought them. fueled by hate.

258
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.120
But then one day I realized...

259
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.040
It was when I cut off and kicked
the head of a 3-meter class.

260
00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.090
It was light. Unnaturally so.

261
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.800
Their bodies are light.

262
00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:34.140
Normally such huge bodies shouldn't even
be able to stand and walk on two legs.

263
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.239
It's the same with every Titan.

264
00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:42.520
Their cut-off body parts were much lighter
than they should have been for their size.

265
00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:49.200
I heard that when you turned into a Titan.
that body appeared out of thin air.

266
00:17:51.140 --> 00:18:00.000
I considered that maybe the things we see
are not the things that are actually there.

267
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:09.960
I tried fighting the Titans
out of hatred for decades.

268
00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:15.740
Now I want to try looking at them from a
different point of view than everyone else.

269
00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:19.230
It might prove to be futile.

270
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.600
But still.

271
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.030
I'll do it.

272
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.380
<i>Since I entered the Recon
Corps. all I get are surprises.</i>

273
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.969
<i>It's not just Major Hanji.</i>

274
00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.580
<i>They're all weirdos.</i>

275
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.260
<i>It's like a haven for freaks.</i>

276
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:47.359
<i>But it's also a group of
people who demand change.</i>

277
00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.660
<i>That is the Recon Corps.</i>

278
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.590
Major Hanji.

279
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:57.349
would you be so kind as to tell
me more about your experiments?

280
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.079
Really?

281
00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:03.031
Yes. I think it might prove useful
in tomorrow's experiments

282
00:19:03.056 --> 00:19:04.909
if I learn as much as I can.

283
00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:11.359
Right... I did skip over some of
the details in my summary earlier.

284
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.109
Let me tell you everything then.

285
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.249
It may end up taking quite a while though.

286
00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:16.120
That's fine.

287
00:19:16.121 --> 00:19:21.460
When we first captured a
Titan. I made a hypothesis.

288
00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:29.130
So you've learned nothing new
from what I told you. right?

289
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:35.140
You should have learned all this as a Cadet.
You knew it all. right?

290
00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.659
Yes. There was nothing new.

291
00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:44.030
So let's go over it again. and this time I'll
add my personal opinions and assumptions!

292
00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.179
Um. I think we...

293
00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:46.980
First of all. the Tita...

294
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:49.610
Is Major Hanji here?!

295
00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:52.199
The experiment subjects...

296
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.820
Both of the Titans were killed!

297
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:06.830
Sawney! Bean!

298
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:08.999
This can't be for real!

299
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.170
Someone tell me I'm dreaming!

300
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.789
Those experimental subjects were
very valuable. Was it a soldier?

301
00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.310
Yes. The culprits are still unknown.

302
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.999
Both Titans were killed before sunrise.

303
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.179
When a guard spotted them. they
escaped using their 3D Maneuver Gear.

304
00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.320
So it was a premeditated
move by at least two people?

305
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.499
Sawney!

306
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:36.570
Check it out! Major Hanji is losing her shit.

307
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.819
What on Earth...

308
00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.839
Let's go. This is the
jurisdiction of the Police.

309
00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.420
Yes. sir...

310
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:50.700
What do you see there?

311
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:55.010
Who do you think is the enemy?

312
00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:02.850
Sorry. don't mind me.

9999
00:00:0.500 --> 00:00:2.00
