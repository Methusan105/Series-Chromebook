1
00:00:01.878 --> 00:00:04.297
In the year 845.

2
00:00:04.506 --> 00:00:10.136
the Colossal Titan and the
Armored Titan suddenly appeared

3
00:00:10.345 --> 00:00:15.141
and destroyed one of humanity's walls..
and everyday life with it.

4
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.021
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria.

5
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.817
lost 20% of its population and
one-third of its territory.

6
00:00:24.025 --> 00:00:28.780
and was forced to retreat behind Wall Rose.

7
00:00:30.907 --> 00:00:33.034
In the year 850.

8
00:00:33.243 --> 00:00:37.872
the Colossal Titan reappeared
and demolished another wall.

9
00:00:38.081 --> 00:00:42.544
Once again. humanity allowed the
Titans to further their advance.

10
00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:46.840
One after another. soldiers fell to the Titans.

11
00:00:47.048 --> 00:00:48.383
And then...

12
00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:49.551
Eren!

13
00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:51.177
Hurry!

14
00:00:54.597 --> 00:00:58.893
Eren Jaeger. who had fallen prey to one...

15
00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:06.693
...reappeared from inside a mysterious Titan.

16
00:01:08.403 --> 00:01:11.740
Attention!

17
00:01:11.948 --> 00:01:15.910
Dot Pyxis. the top officer in charge
of the entire southern territory.

18
00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.457
took notice of Eren Jaeger's
strength while fighting in Titan form

19
00:01:20.665 --> 00:01:24.878
and decided to carry out an unusual plan.

20
00:01:25.086 --> 00:01:28.173
In Titan form.
he will lift that giant rock.

21
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:32.010
carry it to the wrecked gate.
and seal the hole!

22
00:01:33.052 --> 00:01:35.013
Should this operation succeed.

23
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:40.852
humanity will have taken back land
from the Titans for the very first time!

24
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.022
For us. that single. small step...

25
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.399
...will be a great leap forward!

26
00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:54.991
However. that plan was on the
verge of failure as soon as it began...

27
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.138
<i>Unknown are the names
of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

28
00:02:17.347 --> 00:02:22.602
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth
and long for the wind</i>

29
00:02:22.811 --> 00:02:27.690
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

30
00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:33.029
<i>Only the will to fight
can change the here and now!</i>

31
00:02:33.238 --> 00:02:38.326
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve
to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

32
00:02:38.535 --> 00:02:40.870
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

33
00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.748
<i>Give us the freedom of dying.
starving wolves!</i>

34
00:02:43.957 --> 00:02:49.128
<i>The humiliation of being caged
is what triggers us to fight back</i>

35
00:02:49.337 --> 00:02:54.425
<i>We hunters slaughter prey
beyond the castle walls.</i>

36
00:02:54.634 --> 00:02:59.639
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust.</i>

37
00:02:59.848 --> 00:03:06.771
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows
pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

38
00:03:36.968 --> 00:03:39.012
We've successfully managed to gather

39
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.223
most of the Titans
into the corner of the city.

40
00:03:42.432 --> 00:03:45.143
yet. despite avoiding
combat as much as possible.

41
00:03:45.351 --> 00:03:48.146
around 20% of our soldiers have been lost.

42
00:03:48.771 --> 00:03:51.232
No. they were not "lost."

43
00:03:51.441 --> 00:03:54.485
The soldiers did not
die of their own accord.

44
00:03:56.112 --> 00:03:59.198
I ordered them to their deaths.

45
00:04:00.658 --> 00:04:03.786
Humanity is now perched on
the brink of extinction.

46
00:04:03.995 --> 00:04:07.040
If it means ensuring humankind's survival.

47
00:04:07.248 --> 00:04:10.084
I'm willing to go down
in history as a butcher.

48
00:04:27.518 --> 00:04:29.020
Ackermann!

49
00:04:41.157 --> 00:04:42.951
Hey! Stop. Ackermann!

50
00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:44.577
Get away from him!

51
00:04:44.786 --> 00:04:47.163
Eren! Don't you recognize me?!

52
00:04:47.372 --> 00:04:48.957
I'm Mikasa!

53
00:04:49.165 --> 00:04:51.584
Part of your family!

54
00:04:51.793 --> 00:04:55.505
You have to seal the hole with that rock!

55
00:04:55.713 --> 00:04:57.924
The operation's a failure.

56
00:04:58.132 --> 00:05:02.637
I knew there was no "secret weapon."

57
00:05:07.308 --> 00:05:09.310
Eren! You're human!

58
00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:10.645
You're..!

59
00:05:10.853 --> 00:05:12.480
Dodge. Ackermann!

60
00:05:27.286 --> 00:05:28.997
What the hell?!

61
00:05:29.205 --> 00:05:31.040
He's just a regular. dumb Titan!

62
00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:33.543
- Eren!
- Captain Ian!

63
00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:35.336
Two Titans approaching from ahead!

64
00:05:35.545 --> 00:05:38.006
A 10-meter one and a 6-meter one!

65
00:05:38.214 --> 00:05:42.635
One 12-meter Titan is closing in from the rear!

66
00:05:44.637 --> 00:05:46.139
Ian! We have to withdraw!

67
00:05:46.347 --> 00:05:49.350
There's no way that kid's sealing the hole!

68
00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:53.521
Agreed. We have no
choice but to leave him here.

69
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.032
Red smoke shell from the Elite Squad!

70
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.494
It seems the mission to seal
the hole has hit a serious snag.

71
00:06:08.703 --> 00:06:10.204
For nothing...!

72
00:06:10.413 --> 00:06:13.875
Our friends...
have died for nothing!

73
00:06:16.252 --> 00:06:17.670
Hey. look over there!

74
00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:20.048
What is it?! What's wrong?!

75
00:06:20.256 --> 00:06:23.051
They've... failed?

76
00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:24.677
How?

77
00:06:29.015 --> 00:06:31.893
Hey! Where are you going. Armin?!

78
00:06:32.101 --> 00:06:33.644
Commander Pyxis.

79
00:06:33.853 --> 00:06:36.606
We should go back to
defending the gate immediately.

80
00:06:36.814 --> 00:06:37.690
Just give the word. Sir.

81
00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:39.317
No.

82
00:06:39.776 --> 00:06:41.611
Shall I order the
Elite Squad to withdraw?

83
00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:42.612
No.

84
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.450
Continue to lure the
Titans into the corner of town.

85
00:06:47.658 --> 00:06:51.621
As for the Elite Squad. I've left all
on-site decision-making in their hands.

86
00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:53.915
They're more than just skilled.

87
00:06:54.123 --> 00:06:58.503
They're the best of the best. with the
fate of humankind on their shoulders.

88
00:06:58.711 --> 00:07:02.632
Admitting defeat so easily is not an option.

89
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.886
If we don't want our fallen
soldiers' deaths to be in vain...

90
00:07:07.095 --> 00:07:11.265
...then we must struggle
for as long as we live.

91
00:07:11.474 --> 00:07:14.435
Hey! This is no time
to hesitate! Make the call!

92
00:07:14.644 --> 00:07:16.854
Ian! It isn't your fault!

93
00:07:17.063 --> 00:07:19.273
This whole mission
was a long shot to begin with!

94
00:07:19.482 --> 00:07:20.691
We all understand!

95
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.904
It was worth a shot.
and we did the best that we could!

96
00:07:25.113 --> 00:07:28.366
So our teams are
going back up the wall now!

97
00:07:30.785 --> 00:07:32.120
Wait!

98
00:07:32.328 --> 00:07:35.206
Wait. Calm down. Ackermann...

99
00:07:35.414 --> 00:07:38.668
Rico Team. take out
the 12-meter one to the rear!

100
00:07:38.876 --> 00:07:40.878
Mitabi Team and my team
will deal with the two ahead!

101
00:07:41.087 --> 00:07:41.963
What?!

102
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:44.382
I was the one put in charge!

103
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.968
Do as you're ordered!

104
00:07:47.176 --> 00:07:50.304
We can't leave Jaeger defenseless!

105
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.515
Change of plans!

106
00:07:52.723 --> 00:07:56.394
We're to defend Jaeger from the
other Titans until we can recover him!

107
00:07:56.602 --> 00:07:59.480
He holds a precious chance for humanity.

108
00:07:59.689 --> 00:08:01.983
We can't abandon him just like that!

109
00:08:02.191 --> 00:08:06.279
Because unlike us. he can't be replaced.

110
00:08:06.487 --> 00:08:08.948
Hundreds of people
have died in this mission alone

111
00:08:09.157 --> 00:08:11.742
for that failure of a human weapon!

112
00:08:11.951 --> 00:08:15.663
Yet you want to recover him and go
through this same thing all over again?!

113
00:08:15.872 --> 00:08:16.956
That's right.

114
00:08:17.165 --> 00:08:20.459
We have to keep trying.
no matter how many people die!

115
00:08:27.091 --> 00:08:29.302
What happened with Eren?!

116
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.429
Armin's on his way there.

117
00:08:31.637 --> 00:08:33.931
It'll be all right... I think.

118
00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.224
You think?

119
00:08:35.433 --> 00:08:37.602
I'm sure everything will be fine.

120
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:40.605
- Eren'll pull through for us!
- Yeah...

121
00:08:40.813 --> 00:08:43.232
Gathering the Titans in the corner of town

122
00:08:43.441 --> 00:08:44.942
seems nothing but pointless to me.

123
00:08:45.151 --> 00:08:48.613
A fight against a Titan always
turns into a battle of attrition.

124
00:08:48.821 --> 00:08:52.200
We need to avoid losing men
at this point in time.

125
00:08:54.243 --> 00:08:57.705
Meaning soldiers who die at
"this point in time" are dying for nothing?

126
00:08:57.914 --> 00:08:59.582
We'll wage war someday!

127
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.044
So it makes sense to minimize our
losses and conserve our manpower

128
00:09:03.252 --> 00:09:05.046
until that time comes!

129
00:09:05.254 --> 00:09:08.090
- This was the right call to make!
- Was it really. though?

130
00:09:08.299 --> 00:09:10.051
It was!

131
00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:13.512
Well. let's just try not
to end up being "losses."

132
00:09:13.721 --> 00:09:15.765
Both of us.

133
00:09:15.973 --> 00:09:17.642
Are you serious. Ian?!

134
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.561
How is humanity ever
going to beat the Titans then?!

135
00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.605
Tell me. Rico!

136
00:09:22.813 --> 00:09:25.775
What other way do we have of
putting an end to all this?!

137
00:09:25.983 --> 00:09:28.861
How can we defeat the
overwhelming might of the Titans

138
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:33.449
while maintaining our humanity
and not letting anyone die?!

139
00:09:33.658 --> 00:09:38.287
I have no idea how to
defeat the Titans. obviously.

140
00:09:38.496 --> 00:09:39.622
Yes.

141
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.876
That's why we <i>must</i> do this now.
It's our only option.

142
00:09:44.085 --> 00:09:47.797
We have to lay down
our lives and go down bravely

143
00:09:48.005 --> 00:09:51.759
for this so-called human weapon
we barely know anything about!

144
00:09:52.468 --> 00:09:54.262
It's pathetic. isn't it?

145
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:58.432
That <i>this</i> is all we humans can do...

146
00:09:58.641 --> 00:10:01.394
So. what do you say?

147
00:10:01.602 --> 00:10:04.522
This is our battle to wage.

148
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:07.400
Our chance to struggle!

149
00:10:17.034 --> 00:10:19.870
I refuse.

150
00:10:20.079 --> 00:10:21.580
Rico!

151
00:10:21.789 --> 00:10:23.958
I'll follow your plan.

152
00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:27.545
I think your assessment is right.

153
00:10:27.753 --> 00:10:29.714
I'm going to struggle with all my might

154
00:10:29.922 --> 00:10:32.466
and make them taste
the ferocity of humanity.

155
00:10:32.675 --> 00:10:35.428
Because I refuse to die for nothing.

156
00:10:35.636 --> 00:10:39.515
My team will handle
the 12-meter one to the rear.

157
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.313
Let's go! We have the two in front!

158
00:10:45.521 --> 00:10:46.939
Yeah.

159
00:10:49.692 --> 00:10:51.944
Thank you. Captain Ian.

160
00:10:52.153 --> 00:10:55.323
There's no need to thank me. Ackermann.

161
00:10:55.531 --> 00:10:59.577
I was scared stiff there. since there
was no telling what you might do next.

162
00:10:59.785 --> 00:11:01.912
Now you can act freely.
as originally planned.

163
00:11:02.121 --> 00:11:04.832
That should make
better use of your ability.

164
00:11:05.041 --> 00:11:06.459
Yes. Sir.

165
00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:09.337
This is to protect your lover. after all.

166
00:11:09.545 --> 00:11:11.172
He's family...

167
00:11:17.219 --> 00:11:18.554
Huh?

168
00:11:18.763 --> 00:11:21.557
The damaged parts haven't repaired?

169
00:11:21.766 --> 00:11:24.185
Is it because of his earlier wounds?

170
00:11:25.895 --> 00:11:27.605
How is it affecting Eren?

171
00:11:27.813 --> 00:11:32.902
In fact. what guarantee is there
that he can turn back to normal at all?

172
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:34.445
No. never mind.

173
00:11:34.653 --> 00:11:37.073
I won't figure anything out just by thinking.

174
00:11:37.281 --> 00:11:41.077
For now. I have to do what I can do!

175
00:11:48.793 --> 00:11:51.212
Eren... Mikasa...

176
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.047
What happened?!

177
00:12:21.075 --> 00:12:22.618
Huh?

178
00:12:22.827 --> 00:12:28.541
What... am I doing now?

179
00:12:28.749 --> 00:12:31.085
Am I sitting?

180
00:12:31.293 --> 00:12:33.421
I can't see anything...

181
00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:36.674
What day is today?

182
00:12:36.882 --> 00:12:38.384
Where am I?

183
00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.267
Oh...

184
00:12:46.475 --> 00:12:47.893
I'm home...

185
00:12:55.151 --> 00:12:56.861
I'm gonna sleep.

186
00:13:03.826 --> 00:13:05.244
Eren...

187
00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:09.290
What are you doing. Eren?!

188
00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:11.333
Listen up!

189
00:13:11.542 --> 00:13:15.212
We can't let any Titans leave
this corner of town. no matter what!

190
00:13:15.421 --> 00:13:18.924
Focus on that and keep luring them!

191
00:13:19.133 --> 00:13:22.761
You don't need to fight them! Is that clear?

192
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.973
You'll run along the ground.
three cadets per team.

193
00:13:26.182 --> 00:13:27.975
When you reach the wall.
you leap back up.

194
00:13:28.184 --> 00:13:29.685
Don't die out there.

195
00:13:29.894 --> 00:13:33.481
If by some slim chance a
Titan goes astray. we'll take it out.

196
00:13:33.689 --> 00:13:35.107
"By some slim chance?"

197
00:13:35.316 --> 00:13:37.610
There's a pretty <i>good</i> chance. if you ask me.

198
00:13:37.818 --> 00:13:39.862
If we sense any risk.

199
00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.323
are we free to act on our own discretion?

200
00:13:42.531 --> 00:13:44.950
If it'll help somehow.

201
00:13:47.244 --> 00:13:48.579
Kirschtein Team. move out!

202
00:13:48.787 --> 00:13:50.206
Yes. Sir!

203
00:14:08.849 --> 00:14:10.851
Crap! Behind us!

204
00:14:11.477 --> 00:14:13.020
One 13-meter Titan!

205
00:14:13.229 --> 00:14:15.356
It's headed straight for Jaeger!

206
00:14:15.564 --> 00:14:19.151
We have more Titans
coming through the gate!

207
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.570
Four of them. around ten meters high!

208
00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:23.989
- Ackermann! You have the rear one!
- Understood!

209
00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:26.742
Don't let it get to Jaeger!

210
00:14:26.951 --> 00:14:29.370
- Let's hold 'em off here!
- Understood!

211
00:14:29.578 --> 00:14:33.165
Elite soldiers or not. two teams
can't handle four Titans at once...

212
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:49.765
This can't be...

213
00:14:49.974 --> 00:14:52.393
Why are there so many Titans

214
00:14:52.601 --> 00:14:54.853
even though there are so few people here?

215
00:14:55.062 --> 00:14:58.357
Wait. could it be that Eren
is drawing them in?!

216
00:14:58.566 --> 00:14:59.984
Mikasa!

217
00:15:00.317 --> 00:15:01.443
What happened to the plan?!

218
00:15:01.652 --> 00:15:02.653
Armin!

219
00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:04.780
What's happened to Eren?!

220
00:15:04.989 --> 00:15:06.407
Get away! It's dangerous there!

221
00:15:06.615 --> 00:15:09.743
That Titan isn't acting through Eren's will!

222
00:15:09.952 --> 00:15:12.288
I called out to him.
but he wouldn't respond!

223
00:15:12.496 --> 00:15:14.331
There's no getting through to him anymore!

224
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.416
What about the plan?!

225
00:15:15.624 --> 00:15:17.001
It's failed!

226
00:15:17.209 --> 00:15:20.087
We're fighting because
we can't leave Eren behind!

227
00:15:20.296 --> 00:15:22.214
But there are too many Titans...

228
00:15:22.423 --> 00:15:25.259
At this rate.
we'll eventually be wiped out!

229
00:15:35.978 --> 00:15:38.814
From the back of the
head to the nape of the neck...

230
00:15:39.023 --> 00:15:42.484
...one meter high and ten centimeters across!

231
00:15:42.693 --> 00:15:43.611
Armin!

232
00:15:43.819 --> 00:15:45.779
I'll get Eren out of here!

233
00:15:45.988 --> 00:15:48.449
You just protect us from the other Titans!

234
00:15:48.657 --> 00:15:51.619
Huh? What are you...?

235
00:15:51.827 --> 00:15:55.456
Eren came out of the Titans' vital spot!

236
00:15:56.457 --> 00:15:59.251
My guess is that has something to do

237
00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.754
with whatever makes the Titans tick.

238
00:16:01.962 --> 00:16:03.130
It's okay...

239
00:16:03.339 --> 00:16:05.382
As long as I miss the center...

240
00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:08.177
...he won't die.

241
00:16:08.385 --> 00:16:11.388
It'll just...

242
00:16:11.597 --> 00:16:12.765
...hurt a little bit!

243
00:16:12.973 --> 00:16:14.391
Armin!

244
00:16:23.984 --> 00:16:25.694
Stop. Armin! That's too reckless!

245
00:16:25.903 --> 00:16:26.695
Mikasa!

246
00:16:26.904 --> 00:16:31.492
Just go do what you can!
There are lives you can help save!

247
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.370
Leave Eren to me and go!

248
00:16:41.418 --> 00:16:43.671
Eren! Can you hear me?!

249
00:16:43.879 --> 00:16:45.422
Pull yourself together!

250
00:16:45.631 --> 00:16:48.509
We're all going to die
if you don't come out of there!

251
00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:51.011
Don't give in to the Titan's body!

252
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:55.683
Now just hurry and
get out of this lump of flesh!

253
00:16:55.891 --> 00:16:58.352
Get out of here?

254
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.270
Why?

255
00:17:00.479 --> 00:17:03.023
I'm sleepy now...

256
00:17:03.232 --> 00:17:04.441
Eren!

257
00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:06.777
Come out! Hurry!

258
00:17:06.985 --> 00:17:09.196
Eren! Eren!

259
00:17:13.784 --> 00:17:16.704
What happened to avenging your mother?!

260
00:17:16.912 --> 00:17:19.206
You were gonna drive
out all the Titans. remember?!

261
00:17:19.415 --> 00:17:23.544
You hate them for killing
your mother. remember?!

262
00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:27.339
What are you talking about. Armin?

263
00:17:27.548 --> 00:17:31.009
My mom's right here...

264
00:17:31.218 --> 00:17:32.803
Eren! Eren!

265
00:17:33.011 --> 00:17:34.972
Wake up. Eren!

266
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.391
You're in there. aren't you?! Eren!

267
00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:40.853
If we stay here. the Titans will kill us!

268
00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:42.980
It'll all end here!

269
00:17:44.773 --> 00:17:49.445
Seriously. you're not making any sense. Armin...

270
00:17:51.697 --> 00:17:54.533
Why should I have to go outside?

271
00:17:54.742 --> 00:17:56.493
Yeah...

272
00:17:56.702 --> 00:17:59.371
Why would I want to leave?

273
00:18:02.666 --> 00:18:05.377
Why would I want to join the Scouts...?

274
00:18:14.261 --> 00:18:17.639
Like it or not. we're on our own now!

275
00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:29.485
Go'! you!

276
00:18:35.741 --> 00:18:38.660
About time you kicked the bucket. bastard!

277
00:18:43.999 --> 00:18:45.125
Make distance for now!

278
00:18:45.334 --> 00:18:46.960
I've returned!

279
00:18:47.169 --> 00:18:49.296
I'll rendezvous with Mitabi Team!

280
00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:00.516
Huh?!

281
00:19:06.021 --> 00:19:06.814
Jean!

282
00:19:07.022 --> 00:19:08.440
Get going!

283
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:15.280
I've had enough of
people dying because of me!

284
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.965
Damn! Of all the times to have a malfunction!

285
00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:52.860
Jean!

286
00:19:57.739 --> 00:19:59.408
What's going on?

287
00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:01.952
Why isn't he using his ODM gear?!

288
00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:04.288
Oh no!

289
00:20:04.496 --> 00:20:06.456
Don't tell me it's malfunctioning?!

290
00:20:07.416 --> 00:20:09.334
I'll manage somehow!

291
00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:25.225
Damn... I can't believe
I'm draggin' everyone down...

292
00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:41.783
Will this really work out somehow?

293
00:20:44.661 --> 00:20:45.871
Eren...

294
00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:47.956
Eren...

295
00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:49.625
Eren...

296
00:20:51.335 --> 00:20:52.753
Eren...

297
00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:58.926
We're supposed to explore the
outside world someday. remember?

298
00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:04.932
Far beyond these walls. there stretch

299
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:11.939
fiery waters. lands of ice.
and sandy snowfields...

300
00:21:12.147 --> 00:21:15.984
The world my mom and
dad planned to venture into.

301
00:21:20.614 --> 00:21:23.450
I figured you'd just forgotten.

302
00:21:23.659 --> 00:21:25.744
but you actually stopped talking about it

303
00:21:25.953 --> 00:21:30.165
because you didn't want
me to join the Scouts. huh?

304
00:21:30.374 --> 00:21:33.210
The outside... world...?

305
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:39.424
Eren... Answer me...

306
00:21:39.633 --> 00:21:44.513
Even though just one step
outside the wall lies a hellish world...

307
00:21:44.721 --> 00:21:49.768
And even though it might mean
dying a gruesome death like my parents...

308
00:21:49.977 --> 00:21:55.023
Why did you want to
venture into the outside world?!

309
00:21:57.651 --> 00:21:59.069
Why?

310
00:22:00.529 --> 00:22:03.615
Isn't that obvious?

311
00:22:06.243 --> 00:22:07.494
Because...

312
00:22:07.703 --> 00:22:10.080
...I was born in this world!

313
00:22:37.524 --> 00:22:42.446
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

314
00:22:42.654 --> 00:22:48.702
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

315
00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:53.373
<i>Over and over you cast them aside.
only to find more</i>

316
00:22:53.582 --> 00:23:00.047
<i>Now. rest in peace</i>

317
00:23:00.255 --> 00:23:11.391
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

318
00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:21.651
<i>and the more we forget
the more we remember again</i>

319
00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:27.616
<i>In this beautiful. cruel world</i>

320
00:23:27.824 --> 00:23:32.788
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

321
00:23:32.996 --> 00:23:38.502
<i>Oh. with our strength... and our weakness...</i>

322
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:44.174
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

323
00:23:44.382 --> 00:23:47.803
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

324
00:23:54.643 --> 00:23:57.896
Go! Run! Live!
